          "<p>My noble Friend, the Minister of State for Trade and Investment (joint with Foreign and Commonwealth Office), Lord Green, has today made the following statement:</p><p>The EU Competitiveness Council took place in Brussels on 10 and 11 December 2012. I represented the UK on internal market and industry issues on 10 December, and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Universities and Science (David Willetts) represented the UK for research items on 11 December. A summary of those discussions follows.\n</p><p>The main internal market and industry issues discussed on 10 December were: state aid modernisation; industrial policy; Customs 2020; the union customs code; unified patent and the unified patent court; Single Market Act II; public procurement; and mutual recognition of professional qualifications.\n</p><p>Council began with a policy debate on the Commission’s plans to modernise the state aid rules. Commissioner Almunia set out the principles of the initiative, namely a more focused and simplified regime better aligned with EU2020 objectives that better tackled market failure and enhanced EU competitiveness while protecting the internal market. All member states intervened to support the Commission’s objectives, and most then raised specific issues with the proposals. For example, there were calls for more flexible rules on the use of regional aid, changes to thresholds and matching funding. I intervened to support the Commission’s approach, welcoming the intention for scrutiny of state aid to focus on the most difficult cases, and stating the need to avoid the use of state aid to prop up uncompetitive firms or in supporting national champions. Commissioner Almunia then summarised the discussion and said he would take note of the points made.\n</p><p>The next item concerned industrial policy. Firstly adoption of Council conclusions on an industrial policy communication, followed by an exchange of views on CARS2020—an action plan for a competitive and sustainable automotive industry in Europe. The Council adopted conclusions on the industrial policy communication with all member states in agreement on the compromise text. The Council then debated CARS2020. The debate in Council followed on from a dinner hosted by Commissioner Tajani the evening before the Council, which was attended by Michael Fallon, Minister for Business and Enterprise. Most member states intervened on this agenda item, acknowledging the importance of the automotive sector to the EU economy, with many stressing the importance of directing investments towards research and innovation in the sector. The impact on the automotive sector with respect to free trade agreements was also raised, with some member states advocating reciprocity in negotiations. There was also support for better regulation principles in the automotive sector, and ensuring coherence in all policies impacting the sector. I intervened to welcome the Commission’s action plan, whilst stressing that it is for individual companies to make commercial decisions based on capacity and business plans, who should be able to do this without hindrance or interference.\n</p><p>The next substantive agenda item was a discussion on Customs 2020. The Council agreed a partial general approach on the proposed regulation, which provides a legal basis for funding the customs action programme from 2014. At our request, the Commission supported the joint Council/Commission statement confirming that provisions in the regulation fall outside of Tile V.\n</p><p>Discussion then turned to the union customs code dossier. The Commission were particularly concerned to meet the June deadline for the implementation of the recast customs code. Several member states, including the UK, recognised the deadline as a challenge, expressed commitment to achieve it in terms of content and timing, but also that we should not rush to agreement. However, other member states intervened to call for a speedy resolution. The dossier will be further discussed in working groups in January.\n</p><p>Following lunch (there was no Council-based discussion over lunch) the Council gave political endorsement to the patent package, which consists of the regulation creating a unitary patent, the regulation on the language regime and the inter- governmental agreement that would create the unified patent court. Some member states intervened to welcome the package, and some raised a few issues with the text but did not change their position regarding endorsement of the package.\n</p><p>Council conclusions were adopted on Single Market Act II without comment from other member states.\n</p><p>The next substantive agenda item was the public procurement package, consisting of three measures to update EU public procurement rules. The main outstanding point was whether the measure governing procurements by utilities should allow the Commission to initiate reciprocal action against third counties that did not open their procurement markets. At COREPER the presidency had added articles that replicated the existing arrangements whereby the Council could agree, by qualified majority, to restrict access by third countries in certain circumstances. The UK argued that these provisions were not necessary given that a separate legislative proposal on reciprocity was being discussed by trade Ministers, but that we could reluctantly accept the proposal on the clear condition that: they went no further than what was already in EU law; they applied to utilities only (and not general public sector procurements covered by the main “classical” directive); and in forthcoming trilogues with the EP this position should not be changed. Several member states intervened in a similar way. The other elements of package were also discussed. The presidency concluded that general approaches had been agreed on all three texts.\n</p><p>Earlier UK gains relating to mutuals, defence and security (including the revisions to the utilities and concessions texts negotiated after COREPER) and “flexibilisation” of processes, were not challenged so remain in the general approach texts agreed by Council.\n</p><p>The final substantive agenda item was mutual recognition of professional qualifications, where the presidency outlined the progress made on this directive over the past six months. Main interventions by member states concerned recognition of qualifications in the healthcare sector, while other member states called for the need for flexibility to reach agreement as soon as possible.\n</p><p>Several AOB items were discussed at the Council. On the consumer agenda, the presidency informed the Council that they had reached a provisional first reading agreement with the European Parliament on both instruments concerning the alternative dispute mechanism directive and the online dispute mechanism regulation. The presidency also announced that agreement had been reached on all the key provisions in the consumer programme initiative (except use of delegated acts and on the financial envelope) and the Commission also summarised the findings of the recently published consumer markets scoreboard. Three AOB items related to customs were also on the agenda. The Commission presented their report on the EU action plan on intellectual property rights 2009-12, the Council adopted a resolution on an EU customs action plan to combat intellectual property rights infringements 2013-17, and the Council also adopted conclusions on evolution of the customs union. All three dossiers passed without comment. A further AOB point concerned the European semester/annual growth survey, where the Commission discussed growth priorities over the coming year. Again, this passed without comment. The final AOB point concerned the accounting directive, where the presidency reported on the progress on negotiations with the European Parliament. There were still some issues to settle, though it was hoped agreement could be reached at the next trilogue on 18 December 2012.\n</p><p>On 11 December the Council opened with space agenda items, with an exchange of views on a Commission communication on the future relations between the EU and the European Space Agency (ESA). Vice-President Tajani opened the debate by noting the growing role that the EU was playing in space, highlighting Galileo/Egnos and the GMES earth observation system (now named ‘Copernicus’) as particular examples of EU action in this area, and emphasised that article 189 of the treaty on the functioning of the EU, which had introduced a union competence in space, meant that the EU was now an actor in its own right, alongside member states and ESA. Given the importance of the space sector for the EU’s future competitiveness, and as the EU relied heavily on ESA to deliver research and development on its behalf, Mr Tajani argued that the time was right to review the relationship and explore a wide range of options for improved co-operation.\n</p><p>During the discussion that followed the majority of member states agreed that it was appropriate to review relations, although the tone of the Commission’s communication, which focused almost exclusively on the difficulties in the existing relationship, came in for criticism from a number of quarters. A large number (led by the UK amongst others) emphasised that they valued the role of ESA and wished to maintain it as an independent intergovernmental organisation. The UK also noted that it was unfortunate that ESA had not been invited to participate in the discussion. At the end of the debate the Irish delegation confirmed that they intend to adopt Council conclusions on this issue during their presidency.\n</p><p>The main items discussed in the research part of the Council on 11 December were: the specific programme for Horizon 2020 (the EU’s research and innovation funding programme for 2014-20), the strategic innovation agenda (SIA) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the EURATOM programme in Horizon 2020, and the European research area and international collaboration in research.\n</p><p>The presidency sought political agreement on draft texts of the specific programme (the document which sets out the scientific content of the programme) and the EIT’s SIA. On the former, member states agreed to wording in the presidency draft designed to strengthen member state oversight of the implementation of the programme through the member state committees which oversee the various elements of the programme. Several of the newer member states sought to press for amendments which would have strengthened actions aimed at widening participation in the programme; the UK, along with other member states with strong research sectors and the Commission, successfully resisted this move, arguing that the text already included compromises in this direction and that further changes would dilute the programme’s focus on excellence. There were also discussions of the civilian nature of the programme and on the provisions concerning the funding of human embryonic stem cells. Political agreement was reached on the basis of the presidency text with two minor amendments; Malta abstained.\n</p><p>Political agreement was also reached on the EIT SIA.\n</p><p>In other business, the presidency gave a short overview of progress on the EURATOM part of the Horizon 2020 programme. The Council adopted conclusions on the European research area which underlined the importance of completing this by 2014 and Ministers held an exchange of views on international co-operation in research and innovation, based on a Commission communication on this subject.\n</p><p>The lunchtime discussion involved Professor Anne Glover, the EU chief scientific advisor, who outlined her role and spoke on the importance of risk assessment in policy making.\n</p><p>During the discussion that followed my right hon. Friend the Minister for Universities and Science (David Willetts) underlined the important role that Professor Glover, other chief scientific advisors, and Ministers had to play in improving the use of scientific evidence in the policy-making process. In too many instances policies were driven by a restrictive interpretation of the precautionary principle which obstructed innovation by confusing risk and hazard, which risk undermining the EU’s ability to innovate and compete internationally in a range of fields. His intervention was picked up by others and the Irish expressed an interest in following up on it during their presidency.\n</p>"

The UK also noted that it was unfortunate that ESA had not been invited to participate in the discussion. At the end of the debate the Irish delegation confirmed that they intend to adopt Council conclusions on this issue during their presidency.\n</p><p>The main items discussed in the research part of the Council on 11 December were: the specific programme for Horizon 2020 (the EU’s research and innovation funding programme for 2014-20), the strategic innovation agenda (SIA) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the EURATOM programme in Horizon 2020, and the European research area and international collaboration in research.\n</p><p>The presidency sought political agreement on draft texts of the specific programme (the document which sets out the scientific content of the programme) and the EIT’s SIA. On the former, member states agreed to wording in the presidency draft designed to strengthen member state oversight of the implementation of the programme through the member state committees which oversee the various elements of the programme. Several of the newer member states sought to press for amendments which would have strengthened actions aimed at widening participation in the programme; the UK, along with other member states with strong research sectors and the Commission, successfully resisted this move, arguing that the text already included compromises in this direction and that further changes would dilute the programme’s focus on excellence. There were also discussions of the civilian nature of the programme and on the provisions concerning the funding of human embryonic stem cells. Political agreement was reached on the basis of the presidency text with two minor amendments; Malta abstained.\n</p><p>Political agreement was also reached on the EIT SIA.\n</p><p>In other business, the presidency gave a short overview of progress on the EURATOM part of the Horizon 2020 programme. The Council adopted conclusions on the European research area which underlined the importance of completing this by 2014 and Ministers held an exchange of views on international co-operation in research and innovation, based on a Commission communication on this subject.\n</p><p>The lunchtime discussion involved Professor Anne Glover, the EU chief scientific advisor, who outlined her role and spoke on the importance of risk assessment in policy making.\n</p><p>During the discussion that followed my right hon. Friend the Minister for Universities and Science (David Willetts) underlined the important role that Professor Glover, other chief scientific advisors, and Ministers had to play in improving the use of scientific evidence in the policy-making process. In too many instances policies were driven by a restrictive interpretation of the precautionary principle which obstructed innovation by confusing risk and hazard, which risk undermining the EU’s ability to innovate and compete internationally in a range of fields. His intervention was picked up by others and the Irish expressed an interest in following up on it during their presidency.\n</p>"

The Government will continue to consult with the National Joint Registry for England and Wales (NJR) on the Committee’s recommendation to publish raw data from the NJR.\n</p><p>As regards the Committee’s criticism that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) reacted too slowly to Australian data on the safety problems of metal-on-metal hips, the Government would like to reiterate that the MHRA was the first regulatory authority in the world to issue advice on monitoring and patient management in April 2010. The analysis of data from the National Joint Registry for England and Wales was key to the worldwide action to recall the particular metal-on-metal hip system in August 2010.\n</p>"

          "<p>My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Don Foster) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>I am setting out today the changes that will be made to the building regulations regime in England to deliver an even better and more cost-effective way of ensuring our buildings remain safe and sustainable. The changes will deliver savings of around £50 million per year to business. In addition, legislation will also be laid before Parliament shortly to amend the energy\n</p><p>performance of buildings regulations and to repeal unnecessary fire provisions of local Acts which overlap national provisions.\n</p><p>The consultation paper issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 31 January this year contained a range of proposals to improve the building regulations regime. I am setting out today decisions on the deregulatory changes. I am also publishing today a document providing a factual summary of the responses received. The changes have been developed after active engagement with external partners and demonstrate the Government’s ongoing commitment to ensuring that where regulation is necessary the impact on business is properly considered and the associated cost minimised. Decisions on the outstanding issues relating to the energy efficiency of buildings, on better targeting of radon protection measures and the referencing of British Standards for structural design based on Eurocodes will be set out in a further Statement next year. We will also set out next year the outcome of the review of the framework of building regulations and local housing standards which I announced in October.\n</p><p>Engagement with our external partners shows that they continue to value the national minimum standards provided by the building regulations. However, where any concerns do arise it is necessary to address them. That is why we listened to those that expressed concern with the costs associated with the electrical safety in the home provisions in Part P of the building regulations. Some have even advocated that Part P should be revoked as a burdensome requirement on competent electricians. We disagree—Part P has been a success—but we do recognise that there is scope to streamline the requirements by removing the requirement to notify smaller-scale, lower-risk electrical work to a building control body. Currently homeowners can face building control fees of upwards of £240 to have simple electrical work, such as an additional plug socket in a kitchen, approved by a local authority. This change will see the notification requirements focused on higher-risk jobs like the installation of new circuits, or work in the vicinity of showers and baths, which is the right approach. There will, of course, remain a duty for these non-notifiable works to comply with the safety provisions required by the regulations and which we have also updated.\n</p><p>The new Part P seeks to achieve a reasonable balance of risk. We will continue to monitor indicators which can help identify the impact of the changes and keep this under review. But the key to ensuring electrical work is done properly is to employ competent electricians and so the department will continue to work closely with external partners to identify what more can be done to promote the importance of complying with the provisions of Part P through use of a suitably-qualified electrician. In addition, I will be bringing forward further regulations later next year that will introduce an alternative route to demonstrating compliance with Part P by allowing for third-party certification of electrical work. This will safeguard standards while providing a far cheaper way of verifying work is adequate—particularly for those carrying out DIY work. These changes will be accompanied by simpler, clearer and shorter guidance in a new Approved Document P that we will be publishing shortly.\n</p><p>In addition, we will be making a number of other changes to the building regulations. We will amend the technical guidance in Approved Document B (fire safety). In particular, we will update guidance in respect of lighting diffusers which has grown out-of-date as lighting technology has changed considerably. We will also, in relation to wall coverings, be taking forward changes to mitigate problems associated with how the European reaction to fire classifications work in practice. In effect, the changes will maintain the status quo, for example, allowing wallpapers that are currently used to continue to be so in the future. Both these changes have been supported by independent research which shows there are no adverse impacts on safety.\n</p><p>We will also be taking forward rationalisation of guidance supporting Parts M, K and N (access, protection from falling, collision and impact and glazing respectively) to address areas of conflict and overlap, which again impose unnecessary costs. At the same time we will clarify the guidance on access statements in Approved Document M to promote a more proportionate, risk-based approach. These changes will be delivered by clearer guidance in a new Approved Document K and amendment of other approved documents which I will be publishing shortly. We intend that all of these deregulatory changes will come into force on 6 April 2013.\n</p><p>In addition to the changes to the technical provisions, we have also agreed a number of improvements to the building control system. These are relatively minor changes to benefit both local authorities and approved inspectors through changes to the procedures around completion certificates, statutory notifications and removal of the warranty link rule.\n</p><p>The changes to regulations also extend the scope for existing competent person scheme operators. This will allow more work to be self-certified and thereby avoid the need to notify a building control body or pay a building control charge.\n</p><p>In relation to the building regulations, we will also be publishing shortly a new Approved Document 7 which provides updated guidance on adequate materials and workmanship for building work, in particular the implications of the full implementation of the European construction products regulation on 1 July 2013.\n</p><p>Updated energy performance of buildings regulations will also be laid before the House shortly. These, in addition to consolidating the existing regulations, transpose the requirements of the recast energy performance of buildings directive 2010 and remove unnecessary gold-plating. The directive is an EU measure designed to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of carbon produced by buildings.\n</p><p>The new requirements will be introduced on 9 January 2013. The key measures include a requirement for property advertisements to include details of the energy performance certificate rating where available; removal of the requirement to attach the front page of the certificate to any written material; exempting listed buildings from the need to have a certificate on their sale or rent; extending the current requirement for a display energy certificate in large public buildings, to public buildings above 500m² and; introducing a requirement for a certificate to be displayed in commercial premises larger than 500m² that are frequently visited by the public and where one has been previously issued.\n</p><p>Finally, given this Statement relates to the regulation of buildings, I am informing the House that I will also shortly be laying regulations to repeal unnecessary fire provisions in 23 local Acts. The decision has been taken in the light of previous consultation which found no evidence to justify maintaining requirements which go beyond the necessary protection already afforded nationally through the building regulations, and lead to differing and inconsistent rules even within fire and rescue authority areas. Evidence does not establish any statistically significant impact on life safety. These changes are intended to come into force on 9 January 2013.\n</p><p>I will be placing the revised guidance in the approved documents referred to above, along with the impact assessments that accompany all of these changes, in the Library of the House when they are published shortly and alongside the summary of responses that I am placing there today.\n</p>"

In addition, legislation will also be laid before Parliament shortly to amend the energy\n</p><p>performance of buildings regulations and to repeal unnecessary fire provisions of local Acts which overlap national provisions.\n</p><p>The consultation paper issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 31 January this year contained a range of proposals to improve the building regulations regime. I am setting out today decisions on the deregulatory changes. I am also publishing today a document providing a factual summary of the responses received. The changes have been developed after active engagement with external partners and demonstrate the Government’s ongoing commitment to ensuring that where regulation is necessary the impact on business is properly considered and the associated cost minimised. Decisions on the outstanding issues relating to the energy efficiency of buildings, on better targeting of radon protection measures and the referencing of British Standards for structural design based on Eurocodes will be set out in a further Statement next year. We will also set out next year the outcome of the review of the framework of building regulations and local housing standards which I announced in October.\n</p><p>Engagement with our external partners shows that they continue to value the national minimum standards provided by the building regulations. However, where any concerns do arise it is necessary to address them. That is why we listened to those that expressed concern with the costs associated with the electrical safety in the home provisions in Part P of the building regulations. Some have even advocated that Part P should be revoked as a burdensome requirement on competent electricians. We disagree—Part P has been a success—but we do recognise that there is scope to streamline the requirements by removing the requirement to notify smaller-scale, lower-risk electrical work to a building control body. Currently homeowners can face building control fees of upwards of £240 to have simple electrical work, such as an additional plug socket in a kitchen, approved by a local authority. This change will see the notification requirements focused on higher-risk jobs like the installation of new circuits, or work in the vicinity of showers and baths, which is the right approach. There will, of course, remain a duty for these non-notifiable works to comply with the safety provisions required by the regulations and which we have also updated.\n</p><p>The new Part P seeks to achieve a reasonable balance of risk. We will continue to monitor indicators which can help identify the impact of the changes and keep this under review. But the key to ensuring electrical work is done properly is to employ competent electricians and so the department will continue to work closely with external partners to identify what more can be done to promote the importance of complying with the provisions of Part P through use of a suitably-qualified electrician. In addition, I will be bringing forward further regulations later next year that will introduce an alternative route to demonstrating compliance with Part P by allowing for third-party certification of electrical work. This will safeguard standards while providing a far cheaper way of verifying work is adequate—particularly for those carrying out DIY work. These changes will be accompanied by simpler, clearer and shorter guidance in a new Approved Document P that we will be publishing shortly.\n</p><p>In addition, we will be making a number of other changes to the building regulations. We will amend the technical guidance in Approved Document B (fire safety). In particular, we will update guidance in respect of lighting diffusers which has grown out-of-date as lighting technology has changed considerably. We will also, in relation to wall coverings, be taking forward changes to mitigate problems associated with how the European reaction to fire classifications work in practice. In effect, the changes will maintain the status quo, for example, allowing wallpapers that are currently used to continue to be so in the future. Both these changes have been supported by independent research which shows there are no adverse impacts on safety.\n</p><p>We will also be taking forward rationalisation of guidance supporting Parts M, K and N (access, protection from falling, collision and impact and glazing respectively) to address areas of conflict and overlap, which again impose unnecessary costs. At the same time we will clarify the guidance on access statements in Approved Document M to promote a more proportionate, risk-based approach. These changes will be delivered by clearer guidance in a new Approved Document K and amendment of other approved documents which I will be publishing shortly. We intend that all of these deregulatory changes will come into force on 6 April 2013.\n</p><p>In addition to the changes to the technical provisions, we have also agreed a number of improvements to the building control system. These are relatively minor changes to benefit both local authorities and approved inspectors through changes to the procedures around completion certificates, statutory notifications and removal of the warranty link rule.\n</p><p>The changes to regulations also extend the scope for existing competent person scheme operators. This will allow more work to be self-certified and thereby avoid the need to notify a building control body or pay a building control charge.\n</p><p>In relation to the building regulations, we will also be publishing shortly a new Approved Document 7 which provides updated guidance on adequate materials and workmanship for building work, in particular the implications of the full implementation of the European construction products regulation on 1 July 2013.\n</p><p>Updated energy performance of buildings regulations will also be laid before the House shortly. These, in addition to consolidating the existing regulations, transpose the requirements of the recast energy performance of buildings directive 2010 and remove unnecessary gold-plating. The directive is an EU measure designed to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of carbon produced by buildings.\n</p><p>The new requirements will be introduced on 9 January 2013. The key measures include a requirement for property advertisements to include details of the energy performance certificate rating where available; removal of the requirement to attach the front page of the certificate to any written material; exempting listed buildings from the need to have a certificate on their sale or rent; extending the current requirement for a display energy certificate in large public buildings, to public buildings above 500m² and; introducing a requirement for a certificate to be displayed in commercial premises larger than 500m² that are frequently visited by the public and where one has been previously issued.\n</p><p>Finally, given this Statement relates to the regulation of buildings, I am informing the House that I will also shortly be laying regulations to repeal unnecessary fire provisions in 23 local Acts. The decision has been taken in the light of previous consultation which found no evidence to justify maintaining requirements which go beyond the necessary protection already afforded nationally through the building regulations, and lead to differing and inconsistent rules even within fire and rescue authority areas. Evidence does not establish any statistically significant impact on life safety. These changes are intended to come into force on 9 January 2013.\n</p><p>I will be placing the revised guidance in the approved documents referred to above, along with the impact assessments that accompany all of these changes, in the Library of the House when they are published shortly and alongside the summary of responses that I am placing there today.\n</p>"

The Joint Forces Command has been established and its first commander appointed. Many other recommendations are on track for delivery by April 2013 with the implementation of the new delegated financial and military capability operating model: this will strengthen accountability and give the service chiefs much greater freedom to manage their resources and plan for future capability.\n</p><p>A few recommendations will take longer to complete.

The Joint Forces Command has been established and its first commander appointed. Many other recommendations are on track for delivery by April 2013 with the implementation of the new delegated financial and military capability operating model: this will strengthen accountability and give the service chiefs much greater freedom to manage their resources and plan for future capability.\n</p><p>A few recommendations will take longer to complete. I acknowledge that there is more to do in some areas, such as development of the whole force concept and the delivery of improved management information, and I value Lord Levene’s continued interest and focus on these important changes.\n</p><p>I am placing a copy of Lord Levene’s letter in the Library of the House, together with the MoD’s summary of progress against the 53 defence reform recommendations.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Business and Enterprise (Michael Fallon) is today making the following Statement.</p><p>I am today announcing the publication of EFG lending figures by individual bank.\n</p><p>The Government are committed to ensuring that viable small and medium-size enterprises can obtain the finance they need for working capital and investment. EFG plays an important part in this, with over 9,900 SMEs being offered loans with a value in excess of £1 billion since May 2010.\n</p><p>The Government have made a number of important changes to the EFG scheme during the past 12 months. EFG loans are now available to an additional 3,800 businesses with an increase in the turnover limit from £25 million to £41 million. The maximum £1 million lifetime scheme limit has been replaced by a rolling £1 million limit. We also raised by 7% the level of lenders EFG annual loan portfolios to which the Government guarantee applies from 13% to 20%.\n</p><p>This change was made to address the legitimate concern of lenders that they would breach their annual claim limit. In doing this, the Government committed to a more even share of the risk of default with the lenders, with the aim of removing that as a barrier to lending.\n</p><p>EFG is a demand led scheme, accounting for 1% to 2% of overall SME lending. While utilisation is directly linked to subdued demand for credit in the wider economy, overall EFG lending levels are disappointing. There have been some positive signs, with a number of the main banks increasing EFG lending this financial year, albeit from a low level.\n</p><p>It is important that banks lend responsibly and make use of EFG when it is appropriate to do so, but it is clear from the EFG lending figures that a number of lenders could and should be doing more. The publication of individual bank EFG lending figures is intended to help achieve this. In parallel, we are exploring with the banks ways of flexing EFG to address debt serviceability, which is the principal reason behind loan declines. Further detail will be provided in the new year.\n</p><p>The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, already publishes a wide range of EFG lending figures, which are updated on a quarterly basis. Publication of individual EFG lending figures will further enhance this, allowing business customers to identify which banks are making most use of the scheme, and also enable participating lenders and new market entrants to identity new opportunities, thus increasing choice and competition.\n</p><p>This marks a further step towards greater transparency in bank lending, specifically to SMEs.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Business and Enterprise (Michael Fallon) is today making the following Statement.</p><p>I am today announcing the publication of EFG lending figures by individual bank.\n</p><p>The Government are committed to ensuring that viable small and medium-size enterprises can obtain the finance they need for working capital and investment. EFG plays an important part in this, with over 9,900 SMEs being offered loans with a value in excess of £1 billion since May 2010.\n</p><p>The Government have made a number of important changes to the EFG scheme during the past 12 months. EFG loans are now available to an additional 3,800 businesses with an increase in the turnover limit from £25 million to £41 million. The maximum £1 million lifetime scheme limit has been replaced by a rolling £1 million limit. We also raised by 7% the level of lenders EFG annual loan portfolios to which the Government guarantee applies from 13% to 20%.\n</p><p>This change was made to address the legitimate concern of lenders that they would breach their annual claim limit. In doing this, the Government committed to a more even share of the risk of default with the lenders, with the aim of removing that as a barrier to lending.\n</p><p>EFG is a demand led scheme, accounting for 1% to 2% of overall SME lending. While utilisation is directly linked to subdued demand for credit in the wider economy, overall EFG lending levels are disappointing. There have been some positive signs, with a number of the main banks increasing EFG lending this financial year, albeit from a low level.\n</p><p>It is important that banks lend responsibly and make use of EFG when it is appropriate to do so, but it is clear from the EFG lending figures that a number of lenders could and should be doing more. The publication of individual bank EFG lending figures is intended to help achieve this. In parallel, we are exploring with the banks ways of flexing EFG to address debt serviceability, which is the principal reason behind loan declines. Further detail will be provided in the new year.\n</p><p>The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, already publishes a wide range of EFG lending figures, which are updated on a quarterly basis. Publication of individual EFG lending figures will further enhance this, allowing business customers to identify which banks are making most use of the scheme, and also enable participating lenders and new market entrants to identity new opportunities, thus increasing choice and competition.\n</p><p>This marks a further step towards greater transparency in bank lending, specifically to SMEs.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Owen Paterson) has today made the following Statement.</p><p>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 28 and 29 November in Brussels covering agricultural issues. I was accompanied by my honourable friend the Minister of State (David Heath) and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment, Water and Rural Affairs (Richard Benyon) who spoke on fisheries issues. Alun Davies AM, Richard Lochhead MSP and Michelle O’Neil MLA also attended.\n</p><p>The substantive business of the council began with a lunch for agriculture Ministers during which we discussed the topic, proposed by the presidency, of the current context of CAP reform. In the course of discussion it became clear that a significant number of member states did not share the presidency’s view that agreement of a partial general approach on the CAP reform proposals could be achieved at the December council. The presidency accordingly indicated that they would instead provide a report of the progress made on the reform package.\n</p><p>Discussion in the formal session of council covered three aspects of the CAP reform package, addressing a series of questions posed by the presidency to guide discussion.\n</p><p>On greening of direct payments, the presidency sought views on the concept of equivalence, governing any flexibility accorded to member states on how they implemented the requirements. All agreed that an equivalence regime had to be simple, transparent and efficient. Some member states highlighted the need for some form of ex ante approval process to ensure that equivalent measures implemented would not subsequently be deemed insufficient by auditors. Several member states stated that it was important to avoid double funding of the same actions through both direct payments, and rural development funding, but there was little clarity on how this would be achieved.\n</p><p>On the regulation governing the Single Common Market Organisation the discussion focused on whether to retain the date of 2015 for ending beet sugar production quota, as agreed in previous reforms, and on vine planting rights. On sugar, some member states wanted to keep to the original agreement and end quotas in 2015, most beet-producing countries wanted to maintain quota until at least 2020 and those countries which conceded quota previously argued to have it returned. The Commission (Ciolos) held firm on its proposal. Member states also raised aspects of the regulation they were unhappy with. These included milk quotas, vine planting rights, marketing standards, reference prices and producer organisations.\n</p><p>On the rural development regulation, member states raised important outstanding issues. Most member states felt this was the closest regulation to agreement but more work was needed on several detailed aspects.\n</p><p>Council considered a Commission proposal to permit the use of lactic acid as an anti-microbial surface treatment. No member state changed its previously indicated position, and the council offered no opinion. If the European Parliament does not reject the proposal (which now seems likely as the Parliament’s Environment Committee approved it), it will be referred back to the Commission to adopt once the four month scrutiny period expires on 3 February 2013.\n</p><p>Under any other business a report on the rural development error rate was raised by Commissioner Ciolos. At above 7%, it was the highest error rate across all EU budget lines and well above the materiality threshold of 2%. He identified some reasons why this might be the case and suggested that simplification as part of CAP reform could make implementation simpler.\n</p><p>Spain raised the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement, complaining that import prices for tomatoes from Morocco were below the agreed entry price. In response, the Commission pointed out that this is not unusual for this time of year, concluding that this is an issue for national customs authorities which implement the regulations. Spain acknowledged this but thought the Commission should do more to ensure that the correct levies were being applied throughout the EU.\n</p><p>Austria tabled a short paper on their new European food model, and a number of member states supported the initiative, despite its absence of clarity on mechanisms. The Commission suggested it would be a good topic for a future informal Agriculture Council, once CAP reform had concluded.\n</p><p>On fisheries business the council agreed total allowable catches for 2013 and 2014 for deep sea species. This was agreed by qualified majority vote, with Sweden voting against. In line with UK requests alongside the final text the Commission tabled a declaration on the need to seek scientific advice on adding the lowfin gulper shark to the list of species defined as deep sea sharks.\n</p><p>On EU/Norway the council heard an update from the Commission on the first round of talks, and was invited to highlight priorities for the second round taking place 3-7 December. The UK underlined the importance of a successful outcome on North Sea cod and mackerel.\n</p><p>Under any other business Denmark called for a more streamlined decision making process for fixing the catch limits for Norway pout. The Netherlands also tabled a paper on their concerns on the technical conditions under the new protocol for the EU/Mauritania fisheries agreement.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Minister for Europe has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I attended the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 10 December, the Foreign Secretary attending the initial part before handing over to me. I attended the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 11 December in Brussels. The Foreign Affairs Council was chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton of Upholland, and the General Affairs Council was chaired by the Cypriot presidency, the Deputy Minister for European Affairs, Ambassador Andreas Mavroyiannis, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Erato Kozakou-Markoullis.\n</p><p>Foreign Affairs Council\n</p><p>Commissioners Füle (enlargement and European neighbourhood policy) and Georgieva (international co-operation, humanitarian aid and crisis response) were also in attendance for some of the discussions.\n</p><p>A provisional report of the meetings and all conclusions adopted can be found at: http://www.consilium. europa. eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/134152.pdf.\n</p><p>EU-Russia summit\n</p><p>Over lunch, Ministers discussed the EU-Russia summit which will be held in Brussels on 21 December. There was a widely shared view that the EU should focus on human rights, including the role and freedom of NGOs; push Russia to end its restrictive trade practices in order to comply with its World Trade Organisation obligations; press for implementation of the agreement on Siberian overflight royalties; and reaffirm the importance of the third energy package.\n</p><p>Middle East peace process\n</p><p>Ministers considered the need for re-engagement by the international community on the Middle East peace process in 2013 over lunch. Ministers agreed conclusions calling for the parties to return to negotiations without precondition with international support; expressing deep dismay at and strong opposition to recent Israeli announcements on settlements; calling on Israel to avoid undermining the financial situation of the Palestinian\n</p><p>Authority; and urging the Palestinians not to build on their change in UN status in a way that would undermine a return to talks.\n</p><p>Southern Neighbourhood\n</p><p>The council debated the latest developments in Syria, ahead of the next meeting of the Friends of Syria group in Marrakesh on 12 December. During lunch, Ministers exchanged views with Ahmed Moaz Al-Khatib, President of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces.\n</p><p>Ministers agreed conclusions on Syria, expressing their concern at the deteriorating situation, and the need for greater protection of civilians. The conclusions state that “the EU accepts (the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces) as legitimate representatives of the Syrian people”. The conclusions reiterated that “if concerns about war crimes and crimes against humanity are not adequately addressed on a national level, the International Criminal Court should deal with the situation”, and called upon the United Nations Security Council “to urgently address the situation in Syria in all aspects”.\n</p><p>Ministers expressed their concern about the situation in Egypt, ahead of the planned referendum on 15 December. They agreed that it was in the EU’s interest to see a democratic, inclusive, economically-sound Egypt, and noted the need for strong EU engagement with Egypt, based upon mutual accountability.\n</p><p>Ministers discussed the situation in Libya. The high representative stated that there had been a number of positive developments in Libya, politically and economically, and that the EU now needed to develop co-operation in border management and security. Ministers welcomed the fact finding mission, which had demonstrated significant Libyan political will to engage. Ministers noted that the EU needed to build on and sustain contacts with the Libyan authorities and UN so that international efforts were co-ordinated and met Libyan requirements.\n</p><p>Western Balkans\n</p><p>Ministers had a short discussion on western Balkans issues. This was one of a series of western Balkans related meetings building up to the General Affairs Council discussion of the enlargement conclusions. The high representative briefed Ministers on the latest developments in the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue, noting that the successful opening of two crossing points was a significant step in terms of integrated border management implementation. Member states welcomed the leadership of Baroness Ashton on this issue.\n</p><p>The need to maintain a credible EU perspective for Macedonia was also raised.\n</p><p>Council conclusions\n</p><p>As I anticipated in my pre-council statement, Ministers agreed conclusions without discussion on Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In addition, Ministers approved the crisis management concept for a common security and defence policy military mission aimed at providing training and advice to the Malian armed forces; and the revised crisis management concept for the EU training mission for Somalia. In light of the DPRK’s recent announcement of its plan to launch a satellite, in breach of UN Security Council resolutions,\n</p><p>the council agreed conclusions expressing deep concern, urging the DPRK not to conduct the launch, and signalling the need for an international response, potentially including sanctions, were the launch to go ahead.\n</p><p>Ministers agreed without discussion a number of others measures, including:\n</p><p>approval of the EU position and provisional agenda for the 13th meeting of the EU-Azerbaijan Co- operation Council, to take place on 17 December in Brussels;\n</p><p>approval of the EU position and provisional agenda for the 13th meeting of the EU-Georgia Co-operation Council, to take place on 18 December in Brussels;\n</p><p>approval of the EU position and provisional agenda for the 13th meeting of the EU-Armenia Co-operation Council, to take place on 17 December in Brussels;\n</p><p>adoption of a decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of a protocol to the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with the Republic of Armenia, which will allow the participation of Armenia in EU programmes. It forwarded the draft decision on conclusion of the protocol to the European Parliament for its consent;\n</p><p>a review of the list of persons, groups and entities subject to EU restrictive measures with a view to combating terrorism, according to common position 2001/931/CFSP. No changes were made to the measures, which currently affect 11 persons and 25 groups and entities;\n</p><p>approval of preparations for the annual review of EU restrictive measures against Iran; and\n</p><p>adoption of the implementation plan for the EU advisory and assistance mission for security reform in the Democratic Republic of Congo (EUSEC RD Congo) for the period until 30 September 2013.\n</p><p>General Affairs Council\n</p><p>A provisional report of the meeting and all conclusions adopted can be found at: http://www.consilium.europa .eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/EN/genaff/134235.pdf.\n</p><p>Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n</p><p>The GAC discussed the issue of the appointment of nine additional judges for the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The presidency presented its proposals, suggesting a rotating system between member states with a weighted allocation. I emphasised the importance of sufficient representation of judges from a common law background and stressed the need to ensure that the proposals were budget neutral. There was no consensus on this issue which will be revisited next year.\n</p><p>European Semester and the Annual Growth Survey\n</p><p>The Commission presented the main priorities for this year’s Annual Growth Survey, stressing that member states must stay the course on fiscal consolidation and structural reforms if the EU is to achieve long-term, sustainable growth. The incoming Irish presidency then outlined their roadmap for handling the process in council, focusing on the importance of bilateral\n</p><p>dialogue and multilateral surveillance to resolve member states’ concerns relating to country specific recommendations.\n</p><p>Preparation for the December European Council and February European Council\n</p><p>The presidency announced the agenda for the February European Council, which is due to focus on trade and external relations. The outcome of the December European Council will be covered in the Prime Minister’s Statement to the House of Commons and the Leader of the House of Lords’ Statement to the House of Lords.\n</p><p>The 18-month programme for the presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece\n</p><p>The GAC endorsed the programme of the incoming trio of presidencies; Ireland, Lithuania and Greece. The programme covers a broad range of priorities for the next 18-month period. For Ireland, the key was strengthening economic and monetary union, implementing agreed reforms to economic governance, and securing financial stability including banking union. Ireland also looked for progress on the multiannual financial framework and related dossiers. It underlined the importance of measures which have the potential to improve competitiveness and create jobs and growth. Finally, it also wants to see progress on third country trade agreements.\n</p><p>Enlargement\n</p><p>The GAC discussion focussed on Macedonia, Serbia and Kosovo. The council agreed a package of conclusions on enlargement including important steps forward for several countries, which rightly recognise their progress so far.\n</p><p>The council made its commitment to Macedonia’s EU path clear with the council taking a possible decision on opening accession negotiations during the next presidency, based on a report to be presented by the European Commission in spring 2013 on progress relating to good neighbourly relations and movement on the name issue. This is an important and valuable opportunity for Macedonia to move further forward next year, and we look forward to a positive decision to open accession negotiations soon. I welcome, in that regard, the Commission starting preparatory work. Likewise the Government are pleased that the Commission will propose negotiating directives to take forward Kosovo’s EU path with a stabilisation and association agreement, once Kosovo meets the short-term conditions. This will be a significant step forward for Kosovo.\n</p><p>The high representative briefed again on the EU-led dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo. I set out the UK Government’s continued firm support for Serbia’s EU future. The council undertook to review during the first half of next year progress on the conditions the council has agreed for Serbia to open accession negotiations, including progress in the dialogue and irreversible progress on the parallel structures in northern Kosovo, as reiterated by the high representative. The council was clear that it wanted to see Serbia moving to the next stage as soon as it has met the conditions to do so. The recent steps taken in the EU-led dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo had shown that both countries can move forward and deal with difficult issues, enabling them to continue on their European\n</p><p>paths. I welcomed the steps taken by the parties so far and I endorsed the council’s commendation for Prime Ministers Dacic and Thaci: they had approached their recent discussions in a statesman like and courageous manner. The council expected the two sides to continue and accelerate their work in addressing all aspects of the relations between them.\n</p><p>The conclusions on Bosnia and Herzegovina set out the council’s concern about the slow progress being made in Bosnia and Herzegovina and stalled reforms there; and the risk that Bosnia and Herzegovina will lag further behind her neighbours unless the political leaders deliver on the actions they have agreed. The GAC called on the Bosnian leaders to act in the interests of their citizens.\n</p><p>The council conclusions also covered Albania, reflecting recent progress and underlining the need to further intensify efforts as identified by the Commission. The successful conduct of parliamentary elections in 2013 will be a crucial test for the smooth functioning of the country's democratic institutions.\n</p><p>The council adopted forward-looking conclusions on Turkey which will allow the accession process to be taken forward in 2013.\n</p><p>The council looked forward to Croatia’s accession and welcomed progress made by Iceland and Montenegro.\n</p><p>I will continue to update Parliament on future Foreign Affairs Councils and General Affairs Councils.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Minister for Europe has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I attended the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 10 December, the Foreign Secretary attending the initial part before handing over to me. I attended the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 11 December in Brussels. The Foreign Affairs Council was chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton of Upholland, and the General Affairs Council was chaired by the Cypriot presidency, the Deputy Minister for European Affairs, Ambassador Andreas Mavroyiannis, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Erato Kozakou-Markoullis.\n</p><p>Foreign Affairs Council\n</p><p>Commissioners Füle (enlargement and European neighbourhood policy) and Georgieva (international co-operation, humanitarian aid and crisis response) were also in attendance for some of the discussions.\n</p><p>A provisional report of the meetings and all conclusions adopted can be found at: http://www.consilium. europa. eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/134152.pdf.\n</p><p>EU-Russia summit\n</p><p>Over lunch, Ministers discussed the EU-Russia summit which will be held in Brussels on 21 December. There was a widely shared view that the EU should focus on human rights, including the role and freedom of NGOs; push Russia to end its restrictive trade practices in order to comply with its World Trade Organisation obligations; press for implementation of the agreement on Siberian overflight royalties; and reaffirm the importance of the third energy package.\n</p><p>Middle East peace process\n</p><p>Ministers considered the need for re-engagement by the international community on the Middle East peace process in 2013 over lunch. Ministers agreed conclusions calling for the parties to return to negotiations without precondition with international support; expressing deep dismay at and strong opposition to recent Israeli announcements on settlements; calling on Israel to avoid undermining the financial situation of the Palestinian\n</p><p>Authority; and urging the Palestinians not to build on their change in UN status in a way that would undermine a return to talks.\n</p><p>Southern Neighbourhood\n</p><p>The council debated the latest developments in Syria, ahead of the next meeting of the Friends of Syria group in Marrakesh on 12 December. During lunch, Ministers exchanged views with Ahmed Moaz Al-Khatib, President of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces.\n</p><p>Ministers agreed conclusions on Syria, expressing their concern at the deteriorating situation, and the need for greater protection of civilians. The conclusions state that “the EU accepts (the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces) as legitimate representatives of the Syrian people”. The conclusions reiterated that “if concerns about war crimes and crimes against humanity are not adequately addressed on a national level, the International Criminal Court should deal with the situation”, and called upon the United Nations Security Council “to urgently address the situation in Syria in all aspects”.\n</p><p>Ministers expressed their concern about the situation in Egypt, ahead of the planned referendum on 15 December. They agreed that it was in the EU’s interest to see a democratic, inclusive, economically-sound Egypt, and noted the need for strong EU engagement with Egypt, based upon mutual accountability.\n</p><p>Ministers discussed the situation in Libya. The high representative stated that there had been a number of positive developments in Libya, politically and economically, and that the EU now needed to develop co-operation in border management and security. Ministers welcomed the fact finding mission, which had demonstrated significant Libyan political will to engage. Ministers noted that the EU needed to build on and sustain contacts with the Libyan authorities and UN so that international efforts were co-ordinated and met Libyan requirements.\n</p><p>Western Balkans\n</p><p>Ministers had a short discussion on western Balkans issues. This was one of a series of western Balkans related meetings building up to the General Affairs Council discussion of the enlargement conclusions. The high representative briefed Ministers on the latest developments in the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue, noting that the successful opening of two crossing points was a significant step in terms of integrated border management implementation. Member states welcomed the leadership of Baroness Ashton on this issue.\n</p><p>The need to maintain a credible EU perspective for Macedonia was also raised.\n</p><p>Council conclusions\n</p><p>As I anticipated in my pre-council statement, Ministers agreed conclusions without discussion on Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In addition, Ministers approved the crisis management concept for a common security and defence policy military mission aimed at providing training and advice to the Malian armed forces; and the revised crisis management concept for the EU training mission for Somalia. In light of the DPRK’s recent announcement of its plan to launch a satellite, in breach of UN Security Council resolutions,\n</p><p>the council agreed conclusions expressing deep concern, urging the DPRK not to conduct the launch, and signalling the need for an international response, potentially including sanctions, were the launch to go ahead.\n</p><p>Ministers agreed without discussion a number of others measures, including:\n</p><p>approval of the EU position and provisional agenda for the 13th meeting of the EU-Azerbaijan Co- operation Council, to take place on 17 December in Brussels;\n</p><p>approval of the EU position and provisional agenda for the 13th meeting of the EU-Georgia Co-operation Council, to take place on 18 December in Brussels;\n</p><p>approval of the EU position and provisional agenda for the 13th meeting of the EU-Armenia Co-operation Council, to take place on 17 December in Brussels;\n</p><p>adoption of a decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of a protocol to the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with the Republic of Armenia, which will allow the participation of Armenia in EU programmes. It forwarded the draft decision on conclusion of the protocol to the European Parliament for its consent;\n</p><p>a review of the list of persons, groups and entities subject to EU restrictive measures with a view to combating terrorism, according to common position 2001/931/CFSP. No changes were made to the measures, which currently affect 11 persons and 25 groups and entities;\n</p><p>approval of preparations for the annual review of EU restrictive measures against Iran; and\n</p><p>adoption of the implementation plan for the EU advisory and assistance mission for security reform in the Democratic Republic of Congo (EUSEC RD Congo) for the period until 30 September 2013.\n</p><p>General Affairs Council\n</p><p>A provisional report of the meeting and all conclusions adopted can be found at: http://www.consilium.europa .eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/EN/genaff/134235.pdf.\n</p><p>Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n</p><p>The GAC discussed the issue of the appointment of nine additional judges for the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The presidency presented its proposals, suggesting a rotating system between member states with a weighted allocation. I emphasised the importance of sufficient representation of judges from a common law background and stressed the need to ensure that the proposals were budget neutral. There was no consensus on this issue which will be revisited next year.\n</p><p>European Semester and the Annual Growth Survey\n</p><p>The Commission presented the main priorities for this year’s Annual Growth Survey, stressing that member states must stay the course on fiscal consolidation and structural reforms if the EU is to achieve long-term, sustainable growth. The incoming Irish presidency then outlined their roadmap for handling the process in council, focusing on the importance of bilateral\n</p><p>dialogue and multilateral surveillance to resolve member states’ concerns relating to country specific recommendations.\n</p><p>Preparation for the December European Council and February European Council\n</p><p>The presidency announced the agenda for the February European Council, which is due to focus on trade and external relations. The outcome of the December European Council will be covered in the Prime Minister’s Statement to the House of Commons and the Leader of the House of Lords’ Statement to the House of Lords.\n</p><p>The 18-month programme for the presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece\n</p><p>The GAC endorsed the programme of the incoming trio of presidencies; Ireland, Lithuania and Greece. The programme covers a broad range of priorities for the next 18-month period. For Ireland, the key was strengthening economic and monetary union, implementing agreed reforms to economic governance, and securing financial stability including banking union. Ireland also looked for progress on the multiannual financial framework and related dossiers. It underlined the importance of measures which have the potential to improve competitiveness and create jobs and growth. Finally, it also wants to see progress on third country trade agreements.\n</p><p>Enlargement\n</p><p>The GAC discussion focussed on Macedonia, Serbia and Kosovo. The council agreed a package of conclusions on enlargement including important steps forward for several countries, which rightly recognise their progress so far.\n</p><p>The council made its commitment to Macedonia’s EU path clear with the council taking a possible decision on opening accession negotiations during the next presidency, based on a report to be presented by the European Commission in spring 2013 on progress relating to good neighbourly relations and movement on the name issue. This is an important and valuable opportunity for Macedonia to move further forward next year, and we look forward to a positive decision to open accession negotiations soon. I welcome, in that regard, the Commission starting preparatory work. Likewise the Government are pleased that the Commission will propose negotiating directives to take forward Kosovo’s EU path with a stabilisation and association agreement, once Kosovo meets the short-term conditions. This will be a significant step forward for Kosovo.\n</p><p>The high representative briefed again on the EU-led dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo. I set out the UK Government’s continued firm support for Serbia’s EU future. The council undertook to review during the first half of next year progress on the conditions the council has agreed for Serbia to open accession negotiations, including progress in the dialogue and irreversible progress on the parallel structures in northern Kosovo, as reiterated by the high representative. The council was clear that it wanted to see Serbia moving to the next stage as soon as it has met the conditions to do so. The recent steps taken in the EU-led dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo had shown that both countries can move forward and deal with difficult issues, enabling them to continue on their European\n</p><p>paths. I welcomed the steps taken by the parties so far and I endorsed the council’s commendation for Prime Ministers Dacic and Thaci: they had approached their recent discussions in a statesman like and courageous manner. The council expected the two sides to continue and accelerate their work in addressing all aspects of the relations between them.\n</p><p>The conclusions on Bosnia and Herzegovina set out the council’s concern about the slow progress being made in Bosnia and Herzegovina and stalled reforms there; and the risk that Bosnia and Herzegovina will lag further behind her neighbours unless the political leaders deliver on the actions they have agreed. The GAC called on the Bosnian leaders to act in the interests of their citizens.\n</p><p>The council conclusions also covered Albania, reflecting recent progress and underlining the need to further intensify efforts as identified by the Commission. The successful conduct of parliamentary elections in 2013 will be a crucial test for the smooth functioning of the country's democratic institutions.\n</p><p>The council adopted forward-looking conclusions on Turkey which will allow the accession process to be taken forward in 2013.\n</p><p>The council looked forward to Croatia’s accession and welcomed progress made by Iceland and Montenegro.\n</p><p>I will continue to update Parliament on future Foreign Affairs Councils and General Affairs Councils.\n</p>"

Edward Leigh stepped down from the role of financial adviser following his appointment as chair of the Public Accounts Commission in 2011, and Dr John Pugh followed suit. I am grateful for the work they undertook in this capacity.\n</p><p>The MPs prepared a report in 2011 on how parliamentary scrutiny of government expenditure could be improved.

However, the Treasury is working to implement the recommendation that the Government take forward plans for developing mid-year reporting by individual departments. Work on mid-year reporting is underway, and subject to satisfactory progress, we plan to introduce mid-year reporting from 2013-14.\n</p><p>A copy of the report is being placed in the Libraries of both Houses.\n</p>"

More generally, we also see merit in clarifying the point at which the time limit begins for any case with a continuing or series of breaches that give rise to the claim.\n</p><p>Secondly, we are seeking views on removing the right to an oral renewal where a judge refuses permission where there has been a prior judicial process, or where the claim was judged to be totally without merit. The right to appeal to the Court of Appeal would be on the papers.\n</p><p>Thirdly, we are seeking views on the introduction of a new fee for an oral renewal so that fees charged in judicial review proceedings better reflect the costs of providing the service. If the oral renewal is successful, the fee for post permission stages would be waived.\n</p><p>Together, these provide a balanced, practicable and targeted approach to ensure that legitimate claims are brought more quickly and efficiently to a resolution without affecting the right to properly hold the Executive and other public bodies to account.\n</p><p>The engagement exercise will close on 24 January.

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Chris Grayling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>This Government are committed to an ambitious programme of social reform, even at a time of financial constraints. Major changes have already been delivered in welfare and education to tackle the challenge of endemic welfare dependence and educational underperformance, particularly in deprived areas. In the coalition agreement, the Government also promised to introduce a rehabilitation revolution to tackle the unacceptable cycle of reoffending, and today I am publishing a consultation paper entitled Transforming Rehabilitation: A Revolution in the Way We Manage Offenders.\n</p><p>This publication describes my proposals to reform the way in which offenders are rehabilitated in the community through a new focus on life management and mentoring support. I am also planning, for the first time, to extend rehabilitation to those released after serving sentences of less than 12 months, who currently get no support but have the highest reoffending rates.\n</p><p>Reoffending has been far too high for far too long. Despite significant increases in spending on probation under the previous Government, there has been little change in reconviction rates over the past decade. In 2010, nearly half (47.5%) of prisoners were reconvicted within 12 months of release. Failing to divert offenders away from crime has a huge impact. The cost to the Ministry of Justice of dealing with these offenders is considerable, with total expenditure on prisons and offender management standing at £4 billion in 2011-12.\n</p><p>But it is not only expenditure on offender management; the National Audit Office estimated that the wider economic cost was as much as £13 billion in 2007-08.\n</p><p>The proposals in this paper extend provision to a greater number of offenders and increase the focus on rehabilitation. Given the challenging financial context, we will need to increase efficiency and drive down costs to enable us to do this. I therefore intend to begin a process of competition to open up the market and bring in a more diverse mix of providers, delivering increased innovation and improved value for money. To ensure that the system is properly focused on reducing reoffending and deploying more effective interventions, providers will in future only be paid in full when they reduce reconviction rates in their area.\n</p><p>We will not take any risks in protecting the public and the public sector probation service will retain ultimate responsibility for public protection and will manage directly those offenders who pose the highest risk of serious harm to the public—this group will include MAPPA cases. They will also continue to carry out risk assessments for each offender, advise the courts and Parole Board and handle breach cases. The probation service performs a vital role in protecting the public and managing risk—I am determined to preserve that.\n</p><p>The great majority of community sentences and rehabilitation work will, however, be delivered by the private sector and voluntary organisations, which have particular expertise in this area. I am also keen to ensure that probation professionals currently within existing structures have scope to play a full role in the new rehabilitation provision. Providers will be commissioned to deliver community orders and licence requirements for most offenders in broad geographic areas, and will be paid by results to reduce reoffending. They will be expected to tackle the causes of reoffending and help offenders turn their lives around, for example, by providing mentors and signposting to housing, training and employment, and addiction and mental health services.\n</p><p>Our reforms will make use of local experience, and integrate with existing local structures. We want to introduce a system which allows for closer alignment of the variety of services which offenders use, through co-commissioning with other government departments, police and crime commissioners, and local authorities. Potential providers will have to evidence how they would sustain local partnerships in contracts.\n</p><p>These proposals will make a significant change to the system, delivering the Government’s commitment to real reform. Transforming rehabilitation will help to ensure that all of those sentenced to prison or community sentences are properly punished while being supported to turn their backs on crime for good—meaning lower crime, fewer victims and safer communities.\n</p><p>This paper includes the Government’s response to the March 2012 consultation Punishment and Reform: Effective Probation Services.\n</p><p>Copies will be available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office and online at https://consult.justice. gov.uk/digital-communications/transforming-rehabilitation.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Chris Grayling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>This Government are committed to an ambitious programme of social reform, even at a time of financial constraints. Major changes have already been delivered in welfare and education to tackle the challenge of endemic welfare dependence and educational underperformance, particularly in deprived areas. In the coalition agreement, the Government also promised to introduce a rehabilitation revolution to tackle the unacceptable cycle of reoffending, and today I am publishing a consultation paper entitled Transforming Rehabilitation: A Revolution in the Way We Manage Offenders.\n</p><p>This publication describes my proposals to reform the way in which offenders are rehabilitated in the community through a new focus on life management and mentoring support. I am also planning, for the first time, to extend rehabilitation to those released after serving sentences of less than 12 months, who currently get no support but have the highest reoffending rates.\n</p><p>Reoffending has been far too high for far too long. Despite significant increases in spending on probation under the previous Government, there has been little change in reconviction rates over the past decade. In 2010, nearly half (47.5%) of prisoners were reconvicted within 12 months of release. Failing to divert offenders away from crime has a huge impact. The cost to the Ministry of Justice of dealing with these offenders is considerable, with total expenditure on prisons and offender management standing at £4 billion in 2011-12.\n</p><p>But it is not only expenditure on offender management; the National Audit Office estimated that the wider economic cost was as much as £13 billion in 2007-08.\n</p><p>The proposals in this paper extend provision to a greater number of offenders and increase the focus on rehabilitation. Given the challenging financial context, we will need to increase efficiency and drive down costs to enable us to do this. I therefore intend to begin a process of competition to open up the market and bring in a more diverse mix of providers, delivering increased innovation and improved value for money. To ensure that the system is properly focused on reducing reoffending and deploying more effective interventions, providers will in future only be paid in full when they reduce reconviction rates in their area.\n</p><p>We will not take any risks in protecting the public and the public sector probation service will retain ultimate responsibility for public protection and will manage directly those offenders who pose the highest risk of serious harm to the public—this group will include MAPPA cases. They will also continue to carry out risk assessments for each offender, advise the courts and Parole Board and handle breach cases. The probation service performs a vital role in protecting the public and managing risk—I am determined to preserve that.\n</p><p>The great majority of community sentences and rehabilitation work will, however, be delivered by the private sector and voluntary organisations, which have particular expertise in this area. I am also keen to ensure that probation professionals currently within existing structures have scope to play a full role in the new rehabilitation provision. Providers will be commissioned to deliver community orders and licence requirements for most offenders in broad geographic areas, and will be paid by results to reduce reoffending. They will be expected to tackle the causes of reoffending and help offenders turn their lives around, for example, by providing mentors and signposting to housing, training and employment, and addiction and mental health services.\n</p><p>Our reforms will make use of local experience, and integrate with existing local structures. We want to introduce a system which allows for closer alignment of the variety of services which offenders use, through co-commissioning with other government departments, police and crime commissioners, and local authorities. Potential providers will have to evidence how they would sustain local partnerships in contracts.\n</p><p>These proposals will make a significant change to the system, delivering the Government’s commitment to real reform. Transforming rehabilitation will help to ensure that all of those sentenced to prison or community sentences are properly punished while being supported to turn their backs on crime for good—meaning lower crime, fewer victims and safer communities.\n</p><p>This paper includes the Government’s response to the March 2012 consultation Punishment and Reform: Effective Probation Services.\n</p><p>Copies will be available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office and online at https://consult.justice. gov.uk/digital-communications/transforming-rehabilitation.\n</p>"

This is\n</p><p>not a review of the policy relating to funding in research, to which the Government remain committed.\n</p><p>The review will be conducted as set out in Cabinet Office guidance, in two stages.\n</p><p>The first stage will:\n</p><p>identify and examine the key functions of the research councils and assess how these functions contribute to the core business of BIS;\n</p><p>assess the requirement for these to continue;\n</p><p>if continuing, then assess delivery options and where the conclusion is that a particular function is still needed examine how this function might best be delivered, including a cost and benefits analysis where appropriate; and\n</p><p>if one of these options is continuing delivery through the research councils then make an assessment against the Government’s “three tests”: technical function; political impartiality; need for independence from Ministers.\n</p><p>If the outcome of stage 1 is that delivery should continue through research councils then the second stage of the project will be to ensure that it is operating in line with the recognised principles of good corporate governance, using the Cabinet Office “comply or explain” standard approach.\n</p><p>When completed the report of the review will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.\n</p>"

          "<p>My honourable friend the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries (Ed Vaizey) has made the following Statement.</p><p>The Telecommunications Council was held in Brussels on 20 December 2012 under the Cypriot presidency. The Deputy UK Permanent Representative, Shan Morgan, represented the UK at this council.\n</p><p>There were only two substantive items on the agenda. The first item was a progress report from the presidency, followed by an orientation debate (an exchange of views steered by the questions from the presidency) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. (EM10977/12)\n</p><p>The UK intervention highlighted concerns with regard to the complexity of the proposal especially in respect of the current number of delegated and\n</p><p>implementing acts. The UK believed that there is a need to agree to clearer definitions of many of the terms used in the draft text. We also expressed concern regarding the reference to member state liability for electronic identification schemes. Finally, we suggested that while we support the aim of making cross-border transactions easier, we questioned whether harmonised assurance levels were the best way forward.\n</p><p>The majority of other member states, however, did favour minimum harmonised assurance levels for electronic identification. Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Malta and France also suggested that reciprocal assurance levels would be appropriate. A number of delegations said that security levels should be set out in the proposed by the legislation. Many member states supported the UK’s concern about the misuse of delegated acts.\n</p><p>The second substantive item was a full tour de table debate guided by two questions from the presidency on the priorities for the digital agenda for Europe. (DAE—EM9981/10)\n</p><p>Commissioner Kroes (Commissioner for the DAE) opened the debate by introducing the review of the DAE (published on 19 December). She highlighted that her number one priority for the DAE going forward were measures to increase investment in broadband across the EU 27. To facilitate this investment, the Commission will publish later this year a recommendation on costing and non-discrimination for broadband access and a proposal for a regulation to help cut the cost of civil works. She also asked member states to be more supportive of the Connecting Europe Facility proposal; especially the financial instruments which could help leverage increased private sector funding for broadband investment.\n</p><p>The presidency then invited member states to provide an assessment of the progress made on the current digital agenda priorities and to identify where future work on the digital single market should be focused.\n</p><p>The UK intervention highlighted the progress we have made nationally on broadband rollout, especially in connection with funding for broadband rollout in cities (super-connected cities programme). We also noted that any future European assistance on infrastructure should avoid a standardised approach. We then identified our three priorities for future work to maximise growth in the digital single market: removing barriers to investment in broadband investment; achieving an appropriate balance between consumer confidence and costs to business in the draft data protection package; and modernising the copyright framework to ensure it is fit for the digital age.\n</p><p>The Netherlands, Finland, Lithuania, Poland agreed with the UK that one of the priorities is to modernise the copyright framework. However, France urged caution on copyright reform, arguing that content creators must be properly remunerated. Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic highlighted the need for a framework for cloud computing.

          "<p>My honourable friend the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries (Ed Vaizey) has made the following Statement.</p><p>The Telecommunications Council was held in Brussels on 20 December 2012 under the Cypriot presidency. The Deputy UK Permanent Representative, Shan Morgan, represented the UK at this council.\n</p><p>There were only two substantive items on the agenda. The first item was a progress report from the presidency, followed by an orientation debate (an exchange of views steered by the questions from the presidency) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. (EM10977/12)\n</p><p>The UK intervention highlighted concerns with regard to the complexity of the proposal especially in respect of the current number of delegated and\n</p><p>implementing acts. The UK believed that there is a need to agree to clearer definitions of many of the terms used in the draft text. We also expressed concern regarding the reference to member state liability for electronic identification schemes. Finally, we suggested that while we support the aim of making cross-border transactions easier, we questioned whether harmonised assurance levels were the best way forward.\n</p><p>The majority of other member states, however, did favour minimum harmonised assurance levels for electronic identification. Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Malta and France also suggested that reciprocal assurance levels would be appropriate. A number of delegations said that security levels should be set out in the proposed by the legislation. Many member states supported the UK’s concern about the misuse of delegated acts.\n</p><p>The second substantive item was a full tour de table debate guided by two questions from the presidency on the priorities for the digital agenda for Europe. (DAE—EM9981/10)\n</p><p>Commissioner Kroes (Commissioner for the DAE) opened the debate by introducing the review of the DAE (published on 19 December). She highlighted that her number one priority for the DAE going forward were measures to increase investment in broadband across the EU 27. To facilitate this investment, the Commission will publish later this year a recommendation on costing and non-discrimination for broadband access and a proposal for a regulation to help cut the cost of civil works. She also asked member states to be more supportive of the Connecting Europe Facility proposal; especially the financial instruments which could help leverage increased private sector funding for broadband investment.\n</p><p>The presidency then invited member states to provide an assessment of the progress made on the current digital agenda priorities and to identify where future work on the digital single market should be focused.\n</p><p>The UK intervention highlighted the progress we have made nationally on broadband rollout, especially in connection with funding for broadband rollout in cities (super-connected cities programme). We also noted that any future European assistance on infrastructure should avoid a standardised approach. We then identified our three priorities for future work to maximise growth in the digital single market: removing barriers to investment in broadband investment; achieving an appropriate balance between consumer confidence and costs to business in the draft data protection package; and modernising the copyright framework to ensure it is fit for the digital age.\n</p><p>The Netherlands, Finland, Lithuania, Poland agreed with the UK that one of the priorities is to modernise the copyright framework. However, France urged caution on copyright reform, arguing that content creators must be properly remunerated. Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic highlighted the need for a framework for cloud computing. Slovenia and Estonia called for EU grants for broadband.\n</p><p>The presidency then provided progress reports on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the council amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the reuse of public sector information (PSI), a proposal for a directive on guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks. (EM 16006/11) and a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the council concerning the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA–EM 14358/10).\n</p><p>All of these items were noted by council without intervention.\n</p><p>Any Other Business\n</p><p>There were only two items under AOB. We did not intervene on either of them.\n</p><p>The first was a presentation by the Commission on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the council on the accessibility of public sector bodies’ websites, which was published on 4 December 2012.\n</p><p>Finally the Irish delegation informed the council of their priorities for their forthcoming presidency.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer (George Osborne) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>A meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council was held in Brussels on 12 December 2012. Ministers discussed the following item:\n</p><p>Banking supervision mechanism\n</p><p>Ministers agreed an approach on the Commission’s proposal for a single supervisory mechanism in the European Central Bank and an amending regulation for the regulation establishing the European Banking Authority (Regulation 1093/2010).\n</p><p>The Government have been clear that the UK will not participate in the banking union, including the single supervisory mechanism. Other member states outside the eurozone have also signalled that they will not participate at this stage. Accordingly, it is vital that these proposals are underpinned by measures that protect the single market. To ensure this, the Government have secured a number of safeguards to protect those outside banking union.\n</p><p>There will be a duty on the ECB to have regard to the unity and integrity of the single market. Importantly, the ECB will be subject to an express obligation to ensure that no action, proposal or policy of the ECB shall directly or indirectly discriminate against any member state or group of member states as a venue for the provision of banking or financial services in any currency.\n</p><p>The scope of the ECB’s supervisory remit will be expressly limited to credit institutions in participating member states. The supervision of central counterparties will be explicitly excluded from the ECB’s mandate.\n</p><p>The Government have also secured symmetry of treatment between the ECB and national competent authorities in those member states who are not participating in banking union. Powers and decisions of the EBA, for example in cases of mediation between supervisors, will apply equally to the ECB and other supervisors. The Council has also agreed that the ECB’s supervisory powers should be aligned with those available under Union law to national competent authorities in non-participating member states.\n</p><p>There will be a statutory underpinning for a bilateral memorandum of understanding between the ECB and Bank of England to ensure proper co-ordination of supervision for cross-border banks.\n</p><p>The introduction of banking union will see the interests of the eurozone converge as participants move forwards with further integration. We have therefore secured\n</p><p>changes to voting arrangements in the European Banking Authority to ensure that the eurozone cannot systematically dominate decision-making on matters that affect the whole single market. All key decisions taken by the EBA will require a double majority—that is either an overall qualified majority or simple majority in the Board of Supervisors of the EBA, plus a simple majority of representatives of participating member states and a simple majority of representatives of non-participating member states. This will ensure that all member states will continue to have a meaningful voice in EBA decision-making. In addition there will be a review by the Commission of the decision-making rules when the number of non-participating member states reaches four or fewer and this review will report to the European Council.\n</p><p>Taken together, this is a good agreement for the eurozone and the wider European Union, including the UK. The proposals will now be discussed between the Council and the European Parliament before the final texts can be agreed.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer (George Osborne) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>A meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council was held in Brussels on 12 December 2012. Ministers discussed the following item:\n</p><p>Banking supervision mechanism\n</p><p>Ministers agreed an approach on the Commission’s proposal for a single supervisory mechanism in the European Central Bank and an amending regulation for the regulation establishing the European Banking Authority (Regulation 1093/2010).\n</p><p>The Government have been clear that the UK will not participate in the banking union, including the single supervisory mechanism. Other member states outside the eurozone have also signalled that they will not participate at this stage. Accordingly, it is vital that these proposals are underpinned by measures that protect the single market. To ensure this, the Government have secured a number of safeguards to protect those outside banking union.\n</p><p>There will be a duty on the ECB to have regard to the unity and integrity of the single market. Importantly, the ECB will be subject to an express obligation to ensure that no action, proposal or policy of the ECB shall directly or indirectly discriminate against any member state or group of member states as a venue for the provision of banking or financial services in any currency.\n</p><p>The scope of the ECB’s supervisory remit will be expressly limited to credit institutions in participating member states. The supervision of central counterparties will be explicitly excluded from the ECB’s mandate.\n</p><p>The Government have also secured symmetry of treatment between the ECB and national competent authorities in those member states who are not participating in banking union. Powers and decisions of the EBA, for example in cases of mediation between supervisors, will apply equally to the ECB and other supervisors. The Council has also agreed that the ECB’s supervisory powers should be aligned with those available under Union law to national competent authorities in non-participating member states.\n</p><p>There will be a statutory underpinning for a bilateral memorandum of understanding between the ECB and Bank of England to ensure proper co-ordination of supervision for cross-border banks.\n</p><p>The introduction of banking union will see the interests of the eurozone converge as participants move forwards with further integration. We have therefore secured\n</p><p>changes to voting arrangements in the European Banking Authority to ensure that the eurozone cannot systematically dominate decision-making on matters that affect the whole single market. All key decisions taken by the EBA will require a double majority—that is either an overall qualified majority or simple majority in the Board of Supervisors of the EBA, plus a simple majority of representatives of participating member states and a simple majority of representatives of non-participating member states. This will ensure that all member states will continue to have a meaningful voice in EBA decision-making. In addition there will be a review by the Commission of the decision-making rules when the number of non-participating member states reaches four or fewer and this review will report to the European Council.\n</p><p>Taken together, this is a good agreement for the eurozone and the wider European Union, including the UK. The proposals will now be discussed between the Council and the European Parliament before the final texts can be agreed.\n</p>"

I am now pleased to announce the completion of the review.\n</p><p>The Industrial Development Advisory Board is a statutory body which plays an important role providing independent and expert advice to Ministers on large capital investment projects in England, particularly applications under the Grant for Business Investment scheme or the Regional Growth Fund.\n</p><p>The review concludes that the functions performed by the Industrial Development Advisory Board are still required and that it should be retained as an advisory NDPB. The review also looked at the Governance arrangements for IDAB in line with guidance on good corporate governance set out by the Cabinet Office. The report makes some recommendations in this respect; these will be implemented shortly. The full report of the review of IDAB can be found on the BIS website and copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.\n</p>"

          "<p>My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Brandon Lewis) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>Over the past two years, the coalition Government have worked with councils to help freeze council tax bills for hard-working families and pensioners, and this has seen council tax bills in England fall by 4.4% in real terms. Under the last Administration, Band D council tax bills rose by £751 (+109%) across England as a whole.\n</p><p>The Government are setting aside an extra £450 million over the next two years to help local government in England to freeze their council tax in 2013-14, which will be the third successive year in which a freeze scheme applies. The cumulative impact of three years’ worth of council tax freezes represents up to £227 off the council tax bills of an average Band D home.\n</p><p>I am now setting out the provisions for the new scheme that we are offering local authorities, fire and rescue authorities and police and crime commissioners, which freeze or reduce their council tax bills.\n</p><p>Authorities and police and crime commissioners which do not increase their basic amount of council tax in 2013-14 will receive a grant equivalent to the revenue they would have generated by increasing their basic amount of council tax by 1%. The amount an authority will receive will be equivalent to 1% of its 2012-13 average Band D amount, multiplied by a council tax base for 2013-14, which does not take into account reductions given to those receiving council tax support. This will put the calculation for the freeze grant on a consistent basis to previous years’ grants.\n</p><p>The grant will be paid in each of the financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15, amounting to some £225 million of funding in each year, and will be paid in instalments to mirror council tax receipts. Payments will be made using the grant-making powers provided by Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003. Payments will be\n</p><p>made in 10 instalments per financial year from April 2013. As in previous years, local precepting authorities are not eligible for the scheme.\n</p><p>To help local government with budget planning, the Government will publish on their website an estimate of the council tax freeze grant that each participating authority and police and crime commissioner will receive. Grants will be finalised once authorities have reported on their council tax decisions, which they are required to do by March 2013.\n</p><p>I would hope and anticipate that most authorities and police and crime commissioners will choose to take up the grant offer and freeze their element of the council tax. In doing so, they will be providing real help to families and those on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, with their cost of living.\n</p><p>However, for those bodies who choose not to protect families and pensioners and want to increase their council tax, the Government are proposing trigger points for council tax referendums so that any excessive increases in 2013-14 are put to the local electorate for approval. The Secretary of State has today proposed that a 2% referendum principle will apply for all principal local authorities, police and crime commissioners and fire and rescue authorities. This would mean that if an authority wished to raise their relevant basic amount of council tax in 2013-14 by more than 2%, their local electorate will have the opportunity to approve or veto the increase in a binding referendum.\n</p><p>The exception to this excessiveness principle will be shire districts, police and crime commissioners and fire and rescue authorities whose 2012-13 council tax was in the lower quartile of their category of authority. In the case of these authorities, a referendum must be held only where the authority increases its relevant basic amount of council tax for 2013-14 by more than 2%, and there is a cash increase that is more than £5 in the relevant basic amount.\n</p><p>The Secretary of State does not propose to determine principles for local precepting authorities for 2013-14. However, he intends to revisit this issue next year, having considered the extent to which local precepting authorities have exercised restraint in relation to council tax this year.\n</p><p>The Secretary of State is also consulting on alternative notional amount figures in respect of 2012-13 which a number of local authorities must use when determining whether the increase in their relevant basic amount of council tax in 2013-14 is excessive. These are required to reflect changes brought about by the localisation of council tax support. A copy of these amounts has been placed in the Library of the House.\n</p><p>Having considered any representations, the Secretary of State will put the final principles and final Alternative Notional Amount report before the House of Commons for approval alongside the Local Government Finance Report early in 2013.\n</p><p>My officials are today writing to all local authorities, fire authorities and police and crime commissioners with more details of how the council tax freeze scheme will operate. The council tax freeze offer applies to England. However, Barnett consequential funding has also been provided to devolved institutions, and their\n</p><p>electorates will rightly want to hold the devolved representatives to account if they do not offer a council tax freeze to local taxpayers.\n</p>"

          "<p>My honourable friend the Minister for Pensions (Steve Webb) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>The workplace pension reforms are a hugely important part of the Government’s commitment to secure and protect people’s income in retirement. As part of the automatic enrolment process, it is vital that employers comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the law.\n</p><p>The Government therefore intend to introduce legislation at the earliest opportunity to clarify the law and to provide certainty by preventing the avoidance of the automatic enrolment duty through the exploitation of an easement aimed only at employers who provide defined benefits under hybrid schemes or defined benefit schemes. Our intention is for the legislation to have retrospective effect from the date of this announcement.\n</p><p>The legislation will make it clear that only defined benefits (whether offered under a hybrid scheme or a defined benefit scheme) offered to the jobholder in question would satisfy the pre-conditions for employers to defer automatic enrolment under Section 30(2) of the Pensions Act 2008. The legislation will amend the provisions of that Act relating to the transitional\n</p><p>period for defined benefit and hybrid schemes, as well as the definitions of hybrid scheme and defined benefit scheme.\n</p><p>We intend the legislation to have retrospective effect. Any employer who offers only money purchase benefits to the jobholder and has issued a notice to them to defer automatic enrolment under Section 30 will need to automatically enrol that jobholder and backdate employer contributions to the date of this announcement. From the date the legislation comes into force, any employers who will be affected by the legislative change will be required to make back-payments covering the period from the date of this announcement. It will be the jobholder’s choice whether or not they wish to pay their own contributions for this period. Where jobholders wish to make contributions, employers and schemes will need to allow these to be made over an extended period.\n</p><p>Employers offering money purchase benefits will still be able to use the transitional arrangements under Section 29, which permit a gradual phasing in of the contribution requirements over a transitional period.\n</p>"

          "<p>My honourable friend the Minister for Pensions (Steve Webb) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>The workplace pension reforms are a hugely important part of the Government’s commitment to secure and protect people’s income in retirement. As part of the automatic enrolment process, it is vital that employers comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the law.\n</p><p>The Government therefore intend to introduce legislation at the earliest opportunity to clarify the law and to provide certainty by preventing the avoidance of the automatic enrolment duty through the exploitation of an easement aimed only at employers who provide defined benefits under hybrid schemes or defined benefit schemes. Our intention is for the legislation to have retrospective effect from the date of this announcement.\n</p><p>The legislation will make it clear that only defined benefits (whether offered under a hybrid scheme or a defined benefit scheme) offered to the jobholder in question would satisfy the pre-conditions for employers to defer automatic enrolment under Section 30(2) of the Pensions Act 2008. The legislation will amend the provisions of that Act relating to the transitional\n</p><p>period for defined benefit and hybrid schemes, as well as the definitions of hybrid scheme and defined benefit scheme.\n</p><p>We intend the legislation to have retrospective effect. Any employer who offers only money purchase benefits to the jobholder and has issued a notice to them to defer automatic enrolment under Section 30 will need to automatically enrol that jobholder and backdate employer contributions to the date of this announcement. From the date the legislation comes into force, any employers who will be affected by the legislative change will be required to make back-payments covering the period from the date of this announcement. It will be the jobholder’s choice whether or not they wish to pay their own contributions for this period. Where jobholders wish to make contributions, employers and schemes will need to allow these to be made over an extended period.\n</p><p>Employers offering money purchase benefits will still be able to use the transitional arrangements under Section 29, which permit a gradual phasing in of the contribution requirements over a transitional period.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills has made the following Statement.</p><p>The impact of the financial crisis on the cost and availability of credit is seriously affecting the economy. The Government have already taken action to ease the flow of credit to small and medium-sized businesses including by working with the Bank of England to launch the Funding for Lending Scheme, by putting in place access to finance schemes such as the £1.2 billion Business Finance Partnership and the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme, and providing additional funding for the Enterprise Finance Guarantee.\n</p><p>However, many good small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) still struggle to raise finance from their banks. Furthermore, well before the financial crisis Britain suffered from structural failings in finance, in long term credit in particular. Now as the economy recovers, there is a risk that UK businesses lack the support they need to grow.\n</p><p>As set out in the Autumn Statement 2012, the Government therefore plan to deploy an extra £1 billion to create a business bank. We will maximise the bank's impact and reach by exploring joint investment with the private sector and the use of government guarantees. The bank will make wholesale interventions in the business finance market to facilitate the development of a greater diversity of non-bank business finance sources and to tackle other long-standing market gaps. We will also take steps to bring together government finance schemes for small and medium-sized businesses so that they are managed as a single portfolio and ensure businesses are aware of and can access government-backed business advice.\n</p><p>I wish to outline to the House how we will achieve this and what are the key milestones along the way.\n</p><p>We envisage the business bank operating on a commercial basis within a strategic framework set by Ministers. It will be charged with finding ways to fill gaps in the business finance market, based on economic analysis. A number of options are being considered including capital investments and guarantees for long term finance products, as well as a wider range of wholesale funding activities which could become relevant over time. Detailed design of the activities will need to reflect the requirement to ensure our proposals are fully consistent with state aid rules. We plan to start a dialogue with the Commission about our proposals in January.\n</p><p>At the same time, and in order to start acting swiftly, we propose to use £300 million of the new funding to co-invest alongside the private sector in sources of finance that help diversify the business\n</p><p>finance market. These investments will be made under Section 8 of the Industrial Development Act 1982. Further detail of how this funding will be made available will be provided at Budget 2013 after engagement with market participants in the new year.\n</p><p>I am also creating an advisory group, which will comprise independent business and finance experts and advise the Government on the setting up and strategic direction of the new institution. Sir Peter Burt has very kindly agreed to chair this advisory group and additional members will be appointed very shortly. I can also announce today that Keith Morgan has joined the Government to lead the design work for the future business bank. The group will provide advice on:\n</p><p>The activities and specific segments of the market on which different activities of the business bank should focus;\n</p><p>The design of existing interventions and how they could best be improved;\n</p><p>The detailed design of the new interventions, how to make them most effective, and how to attract private sector capital if desirable;\n</p><p>How to ensure better joining up of wider government- funded business advice and support as well as enhanced awareness of and access by businesses to this support;\n</p><p>The role of Government in such an organisation, and at what level;\n</p><p>The overall implementation plan;\n</p><p>The marketing plan for these activities; and\n</p><p>The key roles in terms of design and execution risk for the implementation phase.\n</p><p>We will use their expertise to develop proposals for the bank’s interventions and discuss and where relevant agree these interventions with HMT, the Bank of England, UK regulators and the European Commission.\n</p><p>I will present more detailed proposals on these matters to the House next year.\n</p>"

        "content_t": [
          "<p>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Eric Pickles) made the following Written Ministerial Statement on 7 January 2013.</p><p>I would like to update honourable Members on the main items of business undertaken by my department since the House rose on 20 December 2012.\n</p><p>Helping hard-working families with council tax\n</p><p>On 1 January, my department highlighted new legislation that takes effect in April 2013 which allows local taxpayers to choose to pay their bill over 12 months rather than 10, if they wish. This new right will make it easier for those on fixed incomes to manage their bills, and would lower the average band D council tax instalment by an average of £24 per month for 10 months.\n</p><p>This builds on the support that the Coalition Government have already announced for local authorities and police and crime commissioners in England to help them freeze council tax for a third year and assist in keeping the cost of living down. The Government have set aside £450 million in the Autumn Statement. Taxpayers living in an average band D home in England could save up to £72 compared to a 5% increase, while the cumulative effect of the three years’ worth of freezes is potentially worth over £200 to band D residents. I hope honourable Members will encourage their local authorities to take up this year’s freeze offer.\n</p><p>Tackling council tax fraud helps reduce bills for law-abiding citizens. I intend to lay and publish this week draft affirmative regulations, including setting out the powers which local authorities will have to combat fraud in the council tax system and to prosecute those who commit criminal acts. These regulations will ensure that local authorities continue to be able to tackle fraud when council tax benefit is replaced by local council tax reduction schemes in April, and are consistent with those that prevent fraud in the welfare benefit system. Reflecting the Coalition Government’s commitment to civil liberties, we have scaled back existing state powers which we believe to be disproportionate.\n</p><p>A fairer and simpler planning system\n</p><p>The Coalition Government believe in fair play, with everyone abiding by the same rules. On 21 December, we launched a consultation on proposals to give councils greater freedom to prevent unauthorised traveller sites and the small minority who abuse planning rules. Under proposals, councils would be given greater freedom to determine whether to use temporary stop notices in relation to caravans that are in breach of planning control, and are used as a person’s main residence. This would be backed up with the potential for fines of up to £20,000 on a summary conviction or an unlimited fine on indictment. Subject to the outcome of the consultation, proposals will allow councils to act quickly to stop unauthorised sites before they become established, saving on the costs of enforcement and preventing long-term harm to the environment and local amenity.\n</p><p>The Coalition Government are committed to making the planning system simpler, more efficient and more effective. On 21 December, my department launched a consultation to consider the recommendations of the external review group on planning practice guidance led by Lord Taylor of Goss Moor, to rationalise the volumes of unwieldy and contradictory advice. The goal is to make practice guidance easier to understand for both practitioners and the public. This does not involve any change to planning policy, which is laid out in the National Planning Policy Framework.\n</p><p>On 27 December, my department outlined our response to the consultation paper on streamlining information requirements for planning applications. This will encourage a more proportionate approach to the information that applicants are required to provide with outline planning applications, reducing administrative costs to both applicants and councils, while ensuring that all interested parties continue to be well informed of the details of any proposed application.\n</p><p>A fairer deal for taxpayers on local government pensions\n</p><p>On 21 December, my department published a consultation seeking responses from interested parties on draft regulations for the new Local Government Pension Scheme to come into force in April 2014 relating to membership, contributions and benefits. This represents a key step in the process of reform that began with the commitment given in the Coalition Government’s programme to review the long term affordability and sustainability of public service pension schemes.\n</p><p>Figures for the last financial year show that the Local Government Pensions Scheme costs £7.5 billion. Employers—i.e. taxpayers—contributed £5.9 billion towards maintaining staff pensions. The cost to the public is equivalent to £320 a year for average band D council tax. Yet, for the first year, the cost of local authority pension taxpayer-funded contributions has actually fallen, and these further reforms will protect taxpayers’ interests while protecting those on low and moderate incomes.\n</p><p>Cutting intrusive red tape\n</p><p>On 21 December, my department wrote to local authorities to make clear that equality impact assessments are not a legal requirement. Indeed, they can be resource\n</p><p>intensive and take staff away from planning and delivering important public services. We also reminded councils that statutory guidance makes clear that councils do not need to undertake unnecessary lifestyle or “diversity” questionnaires of their local residents and suppliers. I will shortly be giving guidance to my department’s arm’s-length bodies on the same issue.\n</p><p>On Boxing Day, the media reported how residents in Stockport, Cheshire East and Manchester were being asked about their sexual preferences when they responded to a consultation on a proposed road improvement. This is a typical example of how the public sector wastes money on pointless and intrusive bureaucracy.\n</p><p>A helping hand on housing\n</p><p>On 20 December, my department launched the new £200 million Build to Rent fund which will boost the construction of new homes specifically for private rent. By financing the construction of rental homes until they are built, let out and managed, the fund will give developers the freedom to build homes specifically for that market with confidence. An expert taskforce will also work to boost investor awareness of the fund and offer practical support to those interested in this new market. The prospectus for the fund has been published on the Homes and Communities Agency’s website.\n</p><p>Over Christmas, Ministers highlighted the help available to those sleeping rough through the new StreetLink hotline and website. StreetLink, run by charities Homeless Link and Broadway with funding from my department, offers a valuable alternative to a cash handout for people sleeping rough. This will support the No Second Night Out initiative as it is extended across the country. In London, where No Second Night Out has been adopted, already 70% of rough sleepers have not spent more than one night on the streets.\n</p><p>On 2 January, my department highlighted new deregulation that will cut red tape and costs for homeowners and businesses alike. Changes are being made to the building regulations regime in England to deliver an even better and more cost-effective way of ensuring our buildings remain safe and sustainable. The changes will deliver savings of around £50 million per year to business and will come into force from April 2013. Changes to remove the requirement to notify simple and low risk electrical works will mean that householders keen to improve their home no longer need to pay £240, or more, to their local council to have simple electrical jobs checked.\n</p><p>New Year’s Honours\n</p><p>I wish to congratulate to all those working in the local government, housing, fire and voluntary and community sector that were recognised in the New Year’s Honours List acknowledging their valued contribution to society.\n</p><p>I have placed in the Library a copy of the associated documents and press notices relating to these announcements.\n</p>"

        ],
        "statementText_t": [
          "<p>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Eric Pickles) made the following Written Ministerial Statement on 7 January 2013.</p><p>I would like to update honourable Members on the main items of business undertaken by my department since the House rose on 20 December 2012.\n</p><p>Helping hard-working families with council tax\n</p><p>On 1 January, my department highlighted new legislation that takes effect in April 2013 which allows local taxpayers to choose to pay their bill over 12 months rather than 10, if they wish. This new right will make it easier for those on fixed incomes to manage their bills, and would lower the average band D council tax instalment by an average of £24 per month for 10 months.\n</p><p>This builds on the support that the Coalition Government have already announced for local authorities and police and crime commissioners in England to help them freeze council tax for a third year and assist in keeping the cost of living down. The Government have set aside £450 million in the Autumn Statement. Taxpayers living in an average band D home in England could save up to £72 compared to a 5% increase, while the cumulative effect of the three years’ worth of freezes is potentially worth over £200 to band D residents. I hope honourable Members will encourage their local authorities to take up this year’s freeze offer.\n</p><p>Tackling council tax fraud helps reduce bills for law-abiding citizens. I intend to lay and publish this week draft affirmative regulations, including setting out the powers which local authorities will have to combat fraud in the council tax system and to prosecute those who commit criminal acts. These regulations will ensure that local authorities continue to be able to tackle fraud when council tax benefit is replaced by local council tax reduction schemes in April, and are consistent with those that prevent fraud in the welfare benefit system. Reflecting the Coalition Government’s commitment to civil liberties, we have scaled back existing state powers which we believe to be disproportionate.\n</p><p>A fairer and simpler planning system\n</p><p>The Coalition Government believe in fair play, with everyone abiding by the same rules. On 21 December, we launched a consultation on proposals to give councils greater freedom to prevent unauthorised traveller sites and the small minority who abuse planning rules. Under proposals, councils would be given greater freedom to determine whether to use temporary stop notices in relation to caravans that are in breach of planning control, and are used as a person’s main residence. This would be backed up with the potential for fines of up to £20,000 on a summary conviction or an unlimited fine on indictment. Subject to the outcome of the consultation, proposals will allow councils to act quickly to stop unauthorised sites before they become established, saving on the costs of enforcement and preventing long-term harm to the environment and local amenity.\n</p><p>The Coalition Government are committed to making the planning system simpler, more efficient and more effective. On 21 December, my department launched a consultation to consider the recommendations of the external review group on planning practice guidance led by Lord Taylor of Goss Moor, to rationalise the volumes of unwieldy and contradictory advice. The goal is to make practice guidance easier to understand for both practitioners and the public. This does not involve any change to planning policy, which is laid out in the National Planning Policy Framework.\n</p><p>On 27 December, my department outlined our response to the consultation paper on streamlining information requirements for planning applications. This will encourage a more proportionate approach to the information that applicants are required to provide with outline planning applications, reducing administrative costs to both applicants and councils, while ensuring that all interested parties continue to be well informed of the details of any proposed application.\n</p><p>A fairer deal for taxpayers on local government pensions\n</p><p>On 21 December, my department published a consultation seeking responses from interested parties on draft regulations for the new Local Government Pension Scheme to come into force in April 2014 relating to membership, contributions and benefits. This represents a key step in the process of reform that began with the commitment given in the Coalition Government’s programme to review the long term affordability and sustainability of public service pension schemes.\n</p><p>Figures for the last financial year show that the Local Government Pensions Scheme costs £7.5 billion. Employers—i.e. taxpayers—contributed £5.9 billion towards maintaining staff pensions. The cost to the public is equivalent to £320 a year for average band D council tax. Yet, for the first year, the cost of local authority pension taxpayer-funded contributions has actually fallen, and these further reforms will protect taxpayers’ interests while protecting those on low and moderate incomes.\n</p><p>Cutting intrusive red tape\n</p><p>On 21 December, my department wrote to local authorities to make clear that equality impact assessments are not a legal requirement. Indeed, they can be resource\n</p><p>intensive and take staff away from planning and delivering important public services. We also reminded councils that statutory guidance makes clear that councils do not need to undertake unnecessary lifestyle or “diversity” questionnaires of their local residents and suppliers. I will shortly be giving guidance to my department’s arm’s-length bodies on the same issue.\n</p><p>On Boxing Day, the media reported how residents in Stockport, Cheshire East and Manchester were being asked about their sexual preferences when they responded to a consultation on a proposed road improvement. This is a typical example of how the public sector wastes money on pointless and intrusive bureaucracy.\n</p><p>A helping hand on housing\n</p><p>On 20 December, my department launched the new £200 million Build to Rent fund which will boost the construction of new homes specifically for private rent. By financing the construction of rental homes until they are built, let out and managed, the fund will give developers the freedom to build homes specifically for that market with confidence. An expert taskforce will also work to boost investor awareness of the fund and offer practical support to those interested in this new market. The prospectus for the fund has been published on the Homes and Communities Agency’s website.\n</p><p>Over Christmas, Ministers highlighted the help available to those sleeping rough through the new StreetLink hotline and website. StreetLink, run by charities Homeless Link and Broadway with funding from my department, offers a valuable alternative to a cash handout for people sleeping rough. This will support the No Second Night Out initiative as it is extended across the country. In London, where No Second Night Out has been adopted, already 70% of rough sleepers have not spent more than one night on the streets.\n</p><p>On 2 January, my department highlighted new deregulation that will cut red tape and costs for homeowners and businesses alike. Changes are being made to the building regulations regime in England to deliver an even better and more cost-effective way of ensuring our buildings remain safe and sustainable. The changes will deliver savings of around £50 million per year to business and will come into force from April 2013. Changes to remove the requirement to notify simple and low risk electrical works will mean that householders keen to improve their home no longer need to pay £240, or more, to their local council to have simple electrical jobs checked.\n</p><p>New Year’s Honours\n</p><p>I wish to congratulate to all those working in the local government, housing, fire and voluntary and community sector that were recognised in the New Year’s Honours List acknowledging their valued contribution to society.\n</p><p>I have placed in the Library a copy of the associated documents and press notices relating to these announcements.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has today made the following Statement.</p><p>My noble friend Lord De Mauley, Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Resource Management, the Local Environment and Environmental Science, represented the UK at the EU Environment Council in Brussels on 17 December 2012. Paul Wheelhouse (Scottish Minister for Environment and Climate Change) and John Griffiths (Welsh Minister for Environment and Sustainable Development) also attended.\n</p><p>After adopting the list of legislative and non-legislative A items, Environment Ministers adopted council conclusions on “A Blueprint to Safeguard Europe’s Waters”. The UK welcomed the blueprint, praising its focus on implementation rather than new legislation, which is in line with principles of better regulation. Several other member states similarly supported the blueprint’s focus on implementation and greater integration.\n</p><p>Next, the presidency led an exchange of views on “Greening the European Semester”, based on the annual growth survey 2013. Discussion at Environment Council focused on the bottlenecks to achieving Europe 2020 resource efficiency objectives, and member states were asked to give their views as to which measures in the field of resource efficiency and climate action had the biggest potential to contribute to growth and job creation. A broad range of opinions were put forward. The UK made clear that actions needed to reflect the specificities of each member state; that any additional targets would need to be clearly justified; and highlighted our domestic actions to support resource efficiency. The Commission (Hedegaard) summarised the discussion by stating that the debate was timely, as the annual growth survey was increasingly becoming the key tool for setting economic priorities for the year to come. Discussions on the annual growth survey 2013 will take place at various EU level councils, and will inform debate at the spring European Council in March 2013.\n</p><p>Lord de Mauley attended a ministerial lunch, during which the outcomes of the COP18 climate change negotiations which recently took place in Doha were discussed. Member states recognised that overall a good outcome had been achieved at COP18 but, moving forwards, there is still much work to be done.\n</p><p>In the afternoon, an orientation debate on the 7th EU Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) was held. The Commission said that it had been a “difficult birth”, but that the 7th EAP should offer a clear-cut programme and a solid and pragmatic framework for years to come. The Commission said that there were only a few legislative gaps to be filled, and the main focus was on implementation. The tone of the discussion was generally positive. Many member states, including the UK, welcomed the focus on implementation. The UK said that they believed the environmental acquis was largely complete, and that any new proposals for legislation must be based on evidence and supported\n</p><p>by a robust impact assessment. In that vein, the UK felt that the 7th EAP impact assessment was not quite fit for purpose, and stated that the UK would carry out further work to assess more accurately the ramifications of the programme. The specific concerns of other member states were wide-ranging, but several member states voiced a particular concern about proposed targets to reduce landfill.\n</p><p>Under environmental AOB items, a progress report was offered on the Programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE), and the presidency provided information on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy (priority substances). The presidency also gave information on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (the EIA Directive). Belgium, Spain and the Czech Republic all intervened to air their concerns about the proposed measures, after which the presidency curtailed the discussion, highlighting that there would be further opportunities to discuss the proposal during the Irish presidency.\n</p><p>In the afternoon, several climate change items were discussed under “any other business”. The Emissions Trading Scheme appeared on the agenda in the context of aviation, the recently published carbon market report and the Commission’s proposed measure for changing the auctioning profile for ETS allowances (known as “backloading”). With regards to backloading, Poland presented a paper, based on Commission data, which appeared to show the negative financial impact that backloading would have for certain member states. The Commission responded by questioning the validity of their analysis and was supported by the Netherlands. A proposal to define the modalities for reaching the 2020 targets to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and vans was also presented. Most member states who intervened supported the proposal’s ambition in terms of target levels, and most supported looking at longer-term targets post-2020. The presidency also presented information on proposals for accounting rules and action plans on greenhouse gas emissions and removals relating from activities related to land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). Finally, the Irish presented their priorities for the forthcoming Irish Presidency.\n</p><p>The UK also held short bilateral meetings with Croatia, France, the Netherlands and Lithuania.\n</p>"

Finally, the Irish presented their priorities for the forthcoming Irish Presidency.\n</p><p>The UK also held short bilateral meetings with Croatia, France, the Netherlands and Lithuania.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment Food and Rural Affairs has today made the following Statement.</p><p>The period leading up to Christmas and in to the new year has again seen flooding across the country. This was particularly unfortunate in that it impacted on people and families during the festive season and I would like to offer my sincere sympathies to those who were affected.\n</p><p>The recent floods which began mid way through December affected much of the country. Following on from previous flooding in November and a very wet summer, the December rainfall quickly led to further flooding. Although rain is not unusual at this time of year we have experienced a prolonged period of heavier than usual rainfall during the year. 2012 was the wettest on record in England with some areas experiencing over 131% of average levels. This heavy rain led to flooding from rivers, groundwaters and surface water.\n</p><p>The December floods affected many parts of the country with 532 properties flooded, most notably in the south-west with 379 properties impacted. Nearly 22,000 properties were protected from flooding and over 135,000 properties were sent a warning about the potential risk of flooding giving people essential time to protect their homes and possessions. In total over 1.1 million people are signed up to receive Environment Agency flood warnings.\n</p><p>I would like to pay tribute to the work of the Environment Agency, fire, ambulance, police and other rescue services, local authorities, the voluntary sector and local communities who contributed to the flood response. This is particularly relevant for those who put aside their traditional Christmas and new year celebrations to help others and to them I offer my sincere thanks.\n</p><p>I saw for myself some of the magnificent work that results from this multi-agency response when I visited Upton-upon-Severn to see new flood defence schemes successfully keeping high river flows at bay. I also met some of the people who managed the response at the local incident room in Tewkesbury. Last Thursday the Under-Secretary of State, my honourable friend Richard Benyon visited Dorset and Wiltshire to gain a better understanding of the continuing groundwater flooding challenges and to meet some of the people who contributed to our operational response in the region.\n</p><p>As river levels fall, saturated ground continues to lead to potential groundwater flooding problems. The Environment Agency’s teams will be monitoring groundwater levels across England and Wales for many weeks to come and advising local authorities which lead on groundwater flooding. As the rain eases over the coming days slower responding rivers such as the Thames, Severn, Nene and the Ouse in Yorkshire, will continue to rise in their lower reaches. The Environment Agency will be monitoring these closely.\n</p><p>The recent heavy rain caused major disruption to the rail network in different parts of the UK, particularly in the south-west of England. Major flooding resulted in certain sections of the network being closed and this was compounded by landslips resulting in severe damage to tracks and signalling equipment. Where possible train operating companies either re-routed services or provided alternative means of transport, although this was not always possible due to local road conditions.\n</p><p>On the roads there was some initial minor disruption to the strategic road network but the major impact was on local roads under the responsibility of local authorities.\n</p><p>In addition to the impacts on homes and businesses around the country, the current floods have been keenly felt among farmers. The Somerset levels and moors have been inundated for a large proportion of the year and continue to be under water. The Lower Hampshire Avon has been at flood risk since early July. In the north-east, there has been extensive and prolonged flooding of agricultural land in the Vale of York. I recognise the difficulties that this situation presents to farmers and offer my sincere sympathies to those who have been affected. It is important to note that investment in flood defence schemes has protected agricultural land. For example, 59 projects completed during 2011-12 provided an improved level of flood protection to more than 74,000 hectares of agricultural land. We recognise that concerns have been raised about clearance of water channels in rural areas and that the department is working with the Environment Agency to examine the issue. My department and its agencies will continue to do all that we can to issue warnings and to moderate the impacts of floods. We will assess the long term impact of the recent saturation of agricultural land.\n</p><p>The Government recognise the adverse impacts that flooding has had on communities, both urban and rural, across the country throughout 2012. Continued government investment means that during 2012 we have been able to protect a total of over 200,000 properties from flooding. We now expect to exceed our goal to\n</p><p>better protect 145,000 homes from flooding and coastal erosion by March 2015. The Autumn Statement announced an extra £120 million for flood defences in England during this spending period allowing us to protect up to a further 60,000 properties.\n</p><p>We remain committed to ongoing discussions with the ABI, on behalf of its members, and others about what replaces the statement of principles agreement. It would not be appropriate to comment in detail on their progress. A range of options are on the table and discussions have been very constructive. No final decisions have been taken.\n</p><p>We are keen to improve on the statement of principles. We need a solution that ensures affordable insurance bills for those at flood risk but does not place unsustainable costs on wider policyholders and the taxpayer. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is responsible for the Bellwin scheme of emergency financial assistance to help local authorities with the immediate costs associated with protecting life and properties in their areas. His department stands ready to support all councils that have suffered from the devastating floods including financial support through the Bellwin Scheme and we are monitoring the situation carefully.\n</p><p>High river levels, groundwater flooding, standing water and surface water run-off continue to make conditions difficult in different parts of England. I encourage people to continue to take care and think about their own safety and that of friends, relatives and neighbours.\n</p><p>These floods, coming as they have after a long series of previous floods, have been a tragedy for those affected, and I want to conclude by paying tribute to the wonderful community spirit that I, the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my honourable friend the Member for Newbury, and Members across the House have seen around the country in their local communities. I shall, of course, keep the House informed of any further significant developments.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Mr Jeremy Hunt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>I wish to inform the House that the trust special administrator appointed to South London Healthcare NHS Trust provided me with his final report on 7 January 2013. It makes recommendations to me in relation to securing a sustainable future for services provided by that organisation.\n</p><p>Details about the appointment of the administrator, Matthew Kershaw, were given in a Written Ministerial Statement issued on 12 July 2012, Official Report, cols 47-48ws.\n</p><p>The report was provided to me in accordance with Chapter 5A of the National Health Service Act 2006, as introduced by the Health Act 2009, and has today been laid before Parliament and made publicly available at:\n</p><p>www.dh.gov.uk/health/2013/01/south-london-healthcare/\n</p><p>Copies are available to honourable Members from the Vote Office and to noble Lords from the Printed Paper Office.\n</p><p>I would like to thank Matthew Kershaw for the work he has carried out in producing his report. This is the first time the trust special administrator’s regime has been used since the last Government introduced the provisions which were enacted in the Health Act 2009. In accordance with the legislation, in addition to producing his recommendations on the future of the trust, Mr Kershaw has also been responsible for managing South London Healthcare NHS Trust and maintaining services for patients while the board is suspended pending the outcome of the regime. I do not underestimate the demands this has placed on him.\n</p><p>In triggering this regime, the Government’s priority was to ensure that patients continue to receive high-quality, sustainable NHS services. At the time Mr Kershaw was appointed last July, South London Healthcare NHS Trust was overspending by £1 million a week. In the last financial year, the trust had a deficit at over £65 million, the largest in the country. Left to itself, the trust’s very severe financial position would have continued in a downward spiral of continuing deficits and ultimately threaten the quality of care for patients across south-east London.\n</p><p>The challenges facing South London Healthcare NHS Trust are complex and long standing. To date, it has not proved possible to ensure that South London Healthcare NHS Trust is able to secure a sustainable future for its services within its existing configuration and organisational form. The Government’s priority is to ensure the delivery of a long-term, viable solution for services provided by the trust if it cannot be made sustainable. All responses to my predecessor’s statutory consultation on whether to trigger the regime, including from South London Healthcare NHS Trust itself, stated that a solution for the trust cannot be viewed in isolation from broader service provision within south-east London.\n</p><p>In accordance with my statutory duty, I will consider the trust special administrator’s recommendations carefully and make a final decision that can secure sustainable services for the people of south-east London by 1 February. In considering the recommendations, I will examine particularly:\n</p><p>whether the recommendations are likely to provide a sustainable long term financial position which will secure high quality services in the local area for the future; and\n</p><p>whether the recommendations have regard to the Government’s four key tests for local service reconfiguration. These are support from GP commissioners, strengthened public and patient engagement, clarity on the clinical evidence base and support for patient choice.\n</p><p>Ultimately, my priority is to ensure that all NHS hospitals live within their budgets and achieve the best quality care, best patient outcomes and best patient experience for all their NHS patients.\n</p><p>I will inform the House of my decision as soon as reasonably possible afterwards.\n</p>"

It makes recommendations to me in relation to securing a sustainable future for services provided by that organisation.\n</p><p>Details about the appointment of the administrator, Matthew Kershaw, were given in a Written Ministerial Statement issued on 12 July 2012, Official Report, cols 47-48ws.\n</p><p>The report was provided to me in accordance with Chapter 5A of the National Health Service Act 2006, as introduced by the Health Act 2009, and has today been laid before Parliament and made publicly available at:\n</p><p>www.dh.gov.uk/health/2013/01/south-london-healthcare/\n</p><p>Copies are available to honourable Members from the Vote Office and to noble Lords from the Printed Paper Office.\n</p><p>I would like to thank Matthew Kershaw for the work he has carried out in producing his report. This is the first time the trust special administrator’s regime has been used since the last Government introduced the provisions which were enacted in the Health Act 2009. In accordance with the legislation, in addition to producing his recommendations on the future of the trust, Mr Kershaw has also been responsible for managing South London Healthcare NHS Trust and maintaining services for patients while the board is suspended pending the outcome of the regime. I do not underestimate the demands this has placed on him.\n</p><p>In triggering this regime, the Government’s priority was to ensure that patients continue to receive high-quality, sustainable NHS services. At the time Mr Kershaw was appointed last July, South London Healthcare NHS Trust was overspending by £1 million a week. In the last financial year, the trust had a deficit at over £65 million, the largest in the country. Left to itself, the trust’s very severe financial position would have continued in a downward spiral of continuing deficits and ultimately threaten the quality of care for patients across south-east London.\n</p><p>The challenges facing South London Healthcare NHS Trust are complex and long standing. To date, it has not proved possible to ensure that South London Healthcare NHS Trust is able to secure a sustainable future for its services within its existing configuration and organisational form. The Government’s priority is to ensure the delivery of a long-term, viable solution for services provided by the trust if it cannot be made sustainable. All responses to my predecessor’s statutory consultation on whether to trigger the regime, including from South London Healthcare NHS Trust itself, stated that a solution for the trust cannot be viewed in isolation from broader service provision within south-east London.\n</p><p>In accordance with my statutory duty, I will consider the trust special administrator’s recommendations carefully and make a final decision that can secure sustainable services for the people of south-east London by 1 February. In considering the recommendations, I will examine particularly:\n</p><p>whether the recommendations are likely to provide a sustainable long term financial position which will secure high quality services in the local area for the future; and\n</p><p>whether the recommendations have regard to the Government’s four key tests for local service reconfiguration. These are support from GP commissioners, strengthened public and patient engagement, clarity on the clinical evidence base and support for patient choice.\n</p><p>Ultimately, my priority is to ensure that all NHS hospitals live within their budgets and achieve the best quality care, best patient outcomes and best patient experience for all their NHS patients.\n</p><p>I will inform the House of my decision as soon as reasonably possible afterwards.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change (Greg Barker) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><p>On 19 October 2012, DECC launched a competition for local authorities to bid for £40 million of funding to deliver projects to reduce fuel poverty, help kick-start Green Deal delivery and help consumers to save money on energy bills through collective switching. Organisations were able to submit stand-alone bids for one of the funds, or joint bids across two or all three of the competitions.\n</p><p>DECC received a fantastic response, with bids received from the majority of local councils in England either for funding for individual projects or as part of regional based applications. All three elements of the competition were heavily oversubscribed. In response, we have been able to allocate £46 million to the fund.\n</p><p>£31 million to help vulnerable householders keep warm this winter\n</p><p>DECC has been able to increase the funding available for the fuel poverty element so that we can support 61 outstanding projects, helping 169 local authorities across the country improve the thermal efficiency of homes in their area. This money will be targeted at low income and vulnerable households, helping them cut their energy costs and keep warm this winter and in the future, by installing efficient heating systems and insulation.\n</p><p>In addition to this funding, Government are making sure the most vulnerable households get direct financial help from their supplier. Over 1 million pensioners will get £130 off their fuel bills this winter as part of the Warm Home Discount scheme, with the wider scheme helping around 2 million households overall this year. And direct from the Government, all pensioner households under 79 will get £200 winter fuel payment this winter and those over 80 will get £300—these payments will be paid out to an estimated 12.7 million older people in more than 9 million homes.\n</p><p>£10 million to kick-start Green Deal Pioneer Places projects\n</p><p>The Green Deal, the coalition’s exciting new, innovative plan to help households in Britain improve their homes and save on energy bills, goes live this month. For an introductory period, householders taking out a Green Deal will also be eligible for a cashback incentive. Householders who use the Green Deal to make improvements such as loft insulation, solid wall insulation and new heating systems will qualify. Packages could be worth over £1,000.\n</p><p>To help kick-start the Green Deal, funding has been awarded to 40 successful bids for Green Deal projects covering over 150 English councils. The money\n</p><p>will be used for Green Deal household energy efficiency assessments, whole house retrofits to demonstrate the benefits of energy efficiency, and local events and other activities to raise awareness of the Green Deal. This Pioneer Places scheme builds on the £12 million investment already being channelled into seven Green Deal low carbon cities, announced last September, enabling even more areas to benefit.\n</p><p>£5 million to set up collective switching schemes—Cheaper Energy Together\n</p><p>Money has also been awarded to 31 successful bids under the Cheaper Energy Together scheme, covering 94 local councils and eight third sector organisations in England, Scotland and Wales. Collective purchasing and switching is an innovative way for consumers to group together (through a trusted third party) and use market power to negotiate lower energy bills.\n</p><p>A press notice has been issued today including a link to a list of those projects that are to receive funding. A list of the successful projects has been placed in the Libraries of the House.\n</p>"

This showed the willingness of international companies to invest in the UK’s low-carbon energy future and the confidence of the market in the Government’s proposals on regulatory reform of the electricity market.\n</p><p>The Government welcome all such investment. However, the nuclear industry in the UK is rightly subject to a regulatory regime to ensure safety, security and the mitigation of any potential environmental detriment. Generic design assessment is now an established feature of our regulatory regime and, as I told the House in December after the completion of the GDA process for the AREVA European pressurised water reactor (EPR), it has shown itself to be an excellent process for rigorous and transparent nuclear regulation.\n</p><p>I am therefore pleased to be asking the regulators to assess the ABWR through GDA. The application is an exceptional one. It is an application for GDA of a reactor design which has already been in operation elsewhere in the world, and it follows the purchase by\n</p><p>the vendor and designer of the intended operator of two sites which have been determined in the nuclear national policy statement as potentially suitable for the deployment of new nuclear power stations, and the purchase of the sites themselves.\n</p><p>I therefore think we are right to conduct a separate exercise for this design. This does not rule out a further round of GDA covering other reactor designs which might be built in the UK and we intend to hold such a round at a future date to be determined by market developments and regulatory resources.\n</p><p>As with previous such assessments, the full cost of GDA will be charged to the requesting party which submits the design for assessment.\n</p>"

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Owen Paterson) has today made the following Statement.</p><p>I represented the UK on agricultural matters and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment and Fisheries, Richard Benyon, represented the United Kingdom on fisheries items. Richard Lochhead MSP, Michelle O’Neil MLA and Alun Davies AM were also part of the United Kingdom delegation.\n</p><p>Fisheries\n</p><p>My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment and Fisheries, Richard Benyon, gave an oral statement on the elements of the fisheries negotiations at the December council which directly affected UK interests on Tuesday 8 January.\n</p><p>Black Sea fishing opportunities for 2013 were also agreed at the council. Bulgaria and Romania supported a rollover of the TAC for sprat and resisted a Commission proposal to reduce the TAC for turbot. They successfully argued that, given the fishing interests of non-EU countries in the Black Sea, the only long-term solution was better regional management.\n</p><p>Agriculture\n</p><p>The council welcomed the presidency’s CAP reform progress report and was generally able to accept it as a balanced assessment of the debate on the four main CAP reform proposals. Member states raised common issues they felt are still debatable or important to them. The most common was greening; with most member states happy with the direction of discussion and, with a bit more flexibility, an agreement could be reached. The feeling on internal convergence of direct payments is that it could be phased in over a longer period. On market management issues, some member states called for a more effective safety net and for production restrictions to be maintained for wine, sugar and (to a lesser extent) milk. For the UK, in particular I highlighted that there needed to be further work to simplify the proposals for farmers and national administrations, and cautioned against moves to diverge from a more market-oriented approach to CAP reform.\n</p><p>Any other business\n</p><p>Wine\n</p><p>The Commission presented two reports. One concerned the implementation of the 2008 wine reform, noting that the many objectives set out had been met and the sector was on a better competitive footing as a result, but also suggested some minor adaptations and improvements to the regime and its operation. The second outlined conclusions of the high level group on vine planting rights, with suggestions pointing to a way forward that might see the development of a planting authorisations framework which was controlled by producers rather than member states. I argued that it was important to stick to agreements in previous rounds of CAP reform, including phasing out vine planting rights by 2018. This would provide certainty to businesses and generate the confidence to invest.\n</p><p>Coupled support\n</p><p>Several central and eastern European countries presented a joint paper calling for the option of providing more coupled support in new member states than provided for in the Commission’s cap reform proposal. The Commission noted that this would be dealt with during negotiations.\n</p><p>Sugar levy repayment\n</p><p>Germany requested the Commission expedite legislation to establish a legal basis for recalculation of historic sugar levies paid by producers in order to repay them, including interest (following a recent ECJ case ruling the existing provisions illegal). The UK and other member states supported Germany. Belgium and France called for the interest to be paid from Community funds. The Commission responded with a two-stage approach.

          "<p>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Owen Paterson) has today made the following Statement.</p><p>I represented the UK on agricultural matters and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment and Fisheries, Richard Benyon, represented the United Kingdom on fisheries items. Richard Lochhead MSP, Michelle O’Neil MLA and Alun Davies AM were also part of the United Kingdom delegation.\n</p><p>Fisheries\n</p><p>My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment and Fisheries, Richard Benyon, gave an oral statement on the elements of the fisheries negotiations at the December council which directly affected UK interests on Tuesday 8 January.\n</p><p>Black Sea fishing opportunities for 2013 were also agreed at the council. Bulgaria and Romania supported a rollover of the TAC for sprat and resisted a Commission proposal to reduce the TAC for turbot. They successfully argued that, given the fishing interests of non-EU countries in the Black Sea, the only long-term solution was better regional management.\n</p><p>Agriculture\n</p><p>The council welcomed the presidency’s CAP reform progress report and was generally able to accept it as a balanced assessment of the debate on the four main CAP reform proposals. Member states raised common issues they felt are still debatable or important to them. The most common was greening; with most member states happy with the direction of discussion and, with a bit more flexibility, an agreement could be reached. The feeling on internal convergence of direct payments is that it could be phased in over a longer period. On market management issues, some member states called for a more effective safety net and for production restrictions to be maintained for wine, sugar and (to a lesser extent) milk. For the UK, in particular I highlighted that there needed to be further work to simplify the proposals for farmers and national administrations, and cautioned against moves to diverge from a more market-oriented approach to CAP reform.\n</p><p>Any other business\n</p><p>Wine\n</p><p>The Commission presented two reports. One concerned the implementation of the 2008 wine reform, noting that the many objectives set out had been met and the sector was on a better competitive footing as a result, but also suggested some minor adaptations and improvements to the regime and its operation. The second outlined conclusions of the high level group on vine planting rights, with suggestions pointing to a way forward that might see the development of a planting authorisations framework which was controlled by producers rather than member states. I argued that it was important to stick to agreements in previous rounds of CAP reform, including phasing out vine planting rights by 2018. This would provide certainty to businesses and generate the confidence to invest.\n</p><p>Coupled support\n</p><p>Several central and eastern European countries presented a joint paper calling for the option of providing more coupled support in new member states than provided for in the Commission’s cap reform proposal. The Commission noted that this would be dealt with during negotiations.\n</p><p>Sugar levy repayment\n</p><p>Germany requested the Commission expedite legislation to establish a legal basis for recalculation of historic sugar levies paid by producers in order to repay them, including interest (following a recent ECJ case ruling the existing provisions illegal). The UK and other member states supported Germany. Belgium and France called for the interest to be paid from Community funds. The Commission responded with a two-stage approach. It would soon publish an information note, and follow this up with draft legislation which would contain a retrospective revaluation of levies from 2001-2006.\n</p><p>Milk quota\n</p><p>The Commission presented its second report on the dairy market situation, which concludes that the conditions are in place for a smooth phasing out of the milk quota system in 2015. The report found that the market was functioning well with overall EU production below quota. I welcomed the Commission’s conclusions. Six member states had exceeded their quota and were thus subject to a super-levy in 2012. They disagreed with the Commission’s report and called for measures to help their farmers. Some member states also called for a re-examination of the decision to end milk quota.\n</p><p>Trade in exotic animals\n</p><p>The presidency reported on the recent international conference on the movement of exotic animals. In response the Commission noted its intention to bring forward a legislative proposal in this area.\n</p><p>Incoming Irish presidency priorities\n</p><p>The Irish Agriculture Minister (Simon Coveney) set out his determination to reach a CAP reform deal in June if possible. He urged Ministers to start proper negotiations and move away from repetitive restatements of national positions. The MFF notwithstanding, he hoped the council could reach an agreed position in March to allow negotiations with the European Parliament to begin.\n</p>"

        "content_t": [
          "<p>My honourable friend the Minister of State for Employment Relations and Consumers Affairs (Jo Swinson) has today made the following Statement.</p><p>The Government believe that the UK economy should be supported by a framework of laws that ensures we have a strong and efficient labour market which is flexible, effective and fair. We are looking at the laws that affect all aspects of the relationship between employers and employees, and at each stage of the relationship, through the Employment Law Review. Priorities for reform have been informed by the Red Tape Challenge process, and the results of the 2011 Resolving Workplace Disputes consultation.\n</p><p>Today the Government are publishing their response to the consultation on Ending the Employment Relationship, and launching three further consultations relating to the employment relationship, covering:\n</p><p>how early conciliation should operate in practice;\n</p><p>a range of proposals to improve the TUPE regulations; and,\n</p><p>reforming the regulatory framework for employment agencies and employment businesses.\n</p><p>Our response to the Ending the Employment Relationship consultation details how we will support the legislative changes in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill regarding the inadmissibility of offers of settlement in unfair dismissal claims at employment tribunal, and a power to increase or decrease the limit on the compensation awarded in cases of unfair dismissal.\n</p><p>Settlement agreements offer a dignified, consensual and mutually beneficial way of ending the employment relationship without risking a long, costly and distressing employment tribunal claim. In support of the legislative change, we have consulted on the principles to underpin the system, and the best way for Government to enable employers and employees to approach settlement agreements confidently in a fair and appropriate way. We will ask ACAS to publish a statutory code of practice, which will include template letters for beginning the settlement discussion, and an explanation of the term improper behaviour. Accompanying guidance will supplement the code with more substantive practical\n</p><p>advice, including guidance on good practice for employers to approach settlement within the broader context of management.\n</p><p>The Government intend to introduce the statutory code and guidance by the summer, in line with the legislative change coming into force.\n</p><p>In relation to the unfair dismissal compensatory award cap, the Government intend to introduce a 12 months’ pay cap on the compensatory award for unfair dismissal, subject to parliamentary process. The introduction of a pay-based cap will run alongside a specified overall cap, with the limit the lower of the two figures.\n</p><p>With regards to the overall level of the cap, no consensus emerged in consultation either in terms of whether it should be changed, or, if so, how it should be changed. We are therefore not pursuing a change to the overall cap on the compensatory award for unfair dismissal at this time.\n</p><p>The Government will introduce the necessary secondary legislation to implement the change to the cap after the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill receives Royal Assent.\n</p><p>We are also launching today a further consultation on early conciliation. We announced, in the government response to the Resolving Workplace Disputes consultation, our intention to introduce an early conciliation (EC) process that would make it a requirement for most prospective claimants to send the details of their claim to ACAS before they are able to lodge the claim with the employment tribunal. This proposal, which has received broad support from all stakeholders, will enable ACAS to offer the parties the opportunity to resolve their dispute without the need for tribunal involvement.\n</p><p>We are taking the necessary primary powers to introduce EC in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill. However, the implementation of EC requires secondary legislation and the development of the necessary administrative process. This consultation sets out how we intend that EC should operate.\n</p><p>Our consultation on proposed changes to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) also launches today. TUPE legislation protects employee rights when the business or undertaking for which they work transfers to a new employer. The call for evidence identified concerns that the benefits intended from service provision changes to TUPE made in 2006 had not been achieved and that the provisions on employee liability information were not required.\n</p><p>The Government consider that there is scope to improve the regulations by removing unnecessary gold plating and generally eliminating bureaucracy. Accordingly, we are consulting on a range of proposals designed to ease the transfer process, including the repeal of the service provision changes and the specific requirements regarding the notification of employee liability information.\n</p><p>In addition, we are consulting on a number of proposals to change the wording of particular provisions in TUPE more closely to reflect the acquired rights directive and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n</p><p>One example of this is the provisions restricting changes to contracts. Other proposals will allow smaller firms, in some situations, to inform and consult employees about transfers directly and we will also improve guidance on a range of issues.\n</p><p>Additionally, we are launching today a consultation on reforming the regulatory framework for employment agencies and employment businesses. The recruitment sector plays an important role in the UK’s labour market by improving the efficiency of matching demand for jobs to demand for workers. However, the legislation which regulates the sector is complicated and difficult for businesses and individuals to understand.\n</p><p>We want to reform how the recruitment sector is regulated, ensuring that protections are in place for people looking for work, but removing costly and complex regulations.\n</p><p>We want to establish when it is appropriate for the Government to impose rules on the recruitment sector and when it is more appropriate for the sector and marketplace to decide the rules for themselves. The consultation will also seek views on different enforcement options and whether individual enforcement would be more effective than the current government enforcement regime.\n</p><p>Copies of the Ending the Employment Relationship government response, and of each of the consultation documents being launched today, have been placed in the Libraries of the House.\n</p>"

        ],
        "statementText_t": [
          "<p>My honourable friend the Minister of State for Employment Relations and Consumers Affairs (Jo Swinson) has today made the following Statement.</p><p>The Government believe that the UK economy should be supported by a framework of laws that ensures we have a strong and efficient labour market which is flexible, effective and fair. We are looking at the laws that affect all aspects of the relationship between employers and employees, and at each stage of the relationship, through the Employment Law Review. Priorities for reform have been informed by the Red Tape Challenge process, and the results of the 2011 Resolving Workplace Disputes consultation.\n</p><p>Today the Government are publishing their response to the consultation on Ending the Employment Relationship, and launching three further consultations relating to the employment relationship, covering:\n</p><p>how early conciliation should operate in practice;\n</p><p>a range of proposals to improve the TUPE regulations; and,\n</p><p>reforming the regulatory framework for employment agencies and employment businesses.\n</p><p>Our response to the Ending the Employment Relationship consultation details how we will support the legislative changes in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill regarding the inadmissibility of offers of settlement in unfair dismissal claims at employment tribunal, and a power to increase or decrease the limit on the compensation awarded in cases of unfair dismissal.\n</p><p>Settlement agreements offer a dignified, consensual and mutually beneficial way of ending the employment relationship without risking a long, costly and distressing employment tribunal claim. In support of the legislative change, we have consulted on the principles to underpin the system, and the best way for Government to enable employers and employees to approach settlement agreements confidently in a fair and appropriate way. We will ask ACAS to publish a statutory code of practice, which will include template letters for beginning the settlement discussion, and an explanation of the term improper behaviour. Accompanying guidance will supplement the code with more substantive practical\n</p><p>advice, including guidance on good practice for employers to approach settlement within the broader context of management.\n</p><p>The Government intend to introduce the statutory code and guidance by the summer, in line with the legislative change coming into force.\n</p><p>In relation to the unfair dismissal compensatory award cap, the Government intend to introduce a 12 months’ pay cap on the compensatory award for unfair dismissal, subject to parliamentary process. The introduction of a pay-based cap will run alongside a specified overall cap, with the limit the lower of the two figures.\n</p><p>With regards to the overall level of the cap, no consensus emerged in consultation either in terms of whether it should be changed, or, if so, how it should be changed. We are therefore not pursuing a change to the overall cap on the compensatory award for unfair dismissal at this time.\n</p><p>The Government will introduce the necessary secondary legislation to implement the change to the cap after the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill receives Royal Assent.\n</p><p>We are also launching today a further consultation on early conciliation. We announced, in the government response to the Resolving Workplace Disputes consultation, our intention to introduce an early conciliation (EC) process that would make it a requirement for most prospective claimants to send the details of their claim to ACAS before they are able to lodge the claim with the employment tribunal. This proposal, which has received broad support from all stakeholders, will enable ACAS to offer the parties the opportunity to resolve their dispute without the need for tribunal involvement.\n</p><p>We are taking the necessary primary powers to introduce EC in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill. However, the implementation of EC requires secondary legislation and the development of the necessary administrative process. This consultation sets out how we intend that EC should operate.\n</p><p>Our consultation on proposed changes to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) also launches today. TUPE legislation protects employee rights when the business or undertaking for which they work transfers to a new employer. The call for evidence identified concerns that the benefits intended from service provision changes to TUPE made in 2006 had not been achieved and that the provisions on employee liability information were not required.\n</p><p>The Government consider that there is scope to improve the regulations by removing unnecessary gold plating and generally eliminating bureaucracy. Accordingly, we are consulting on a range of proposals designed to ease the transfer process, including the repeal of the service provision changes and the specific requirements regarding the notification of employee liability information.\n</p><p>In addition, we are consulting on a number of proposals to change the wording of particular provisions in TUPE more closely to reflect the acquired rights directive and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n</p><p>One example of this is the provisions restricting changes to contracts. Other proposals will allow smaller firms, in some situations, to inform and consult employees about transfers directly and we will also improve guidance on a range of issues.\n</p><p>Additionally, we are launching today a consultation on reforming the regulatory framework for employment agencies and employment businesses. The recruitment sector plays an important role in the UK’s labour market by improving the efficiency of matching demand for jobs to demand for workers. However, the legislation which regulates the sector is complicated and difficult for businesses and individuals to understand.\n</p><p>We want to reform how the recruitment sector is regulated, ensuring that protections are in place for people looking for work, but removing costly and complex regulations.\n</p><p>We want to establish when it is appropriate for the Government to impose rules on the recruitment sector and when it is more appropriate for the sector and marketplace to decide the rules for themselves. The consultation will also seek views on different enforcement options and whether individual enforcement would be more effective than the current government enforcement regime.\n</p><p>Copies of the Ending the Employment Relationship government response, and of each of the consultation documents being launched today, have been placed in the Libraries of the House.\n</p>"
