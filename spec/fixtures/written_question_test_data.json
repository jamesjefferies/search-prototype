We continue to call on the Israeli Government to take immediate action to ensure that all such cases are reviewed by a court in accordance with fair procedures, and that detainees’ rights are upheld, particularly with regard to fair trial and family visits. All prisoners should have access to a fair trial, and Israel should ensure that it acts always in accordance with international law. We will continue to raise our concerns with the Israeli authorities and to issue statements when appropriate.</p>"

We are very concerned by the continuing reports of sexual violence in conflicts by the military in Burma's conflict areas. The Burmese Government have done little to investigate these allegations.

The projected gain in the EU's exports to Korea as a result of the EU-South Korea FTA is between 62% and 82%.
