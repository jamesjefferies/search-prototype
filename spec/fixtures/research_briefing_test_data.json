Since then the boundaries of the \nDarlington constituency have gradually extended to reflect the growth of the town of \nDarlington.  The parts of the modern constituency that were at one time beyond the \nboundaries, particularly in the nineteenth century, formed part of the county constituencies \nsurrounding Darlington.  The boundaries of the Darlington constituency have changed very \nlittle since 1950.  The latest boundary changes following the Fifth Periodical Review of \nParliamentary constituencies in England, implemented at the 2010 general election, \ntransferred approximately 670 voters from the Sedgefield constituency to the Darlington \nconstituency. \n \n \n \nSince the Second World War the Darlington constituency has returned mostly Labour MPs.  \nThe exceptions were when Conservative MPs were returned between 1951 and 1964 (Sir \nFergus Graham 1951-1959 and Anthony Bourne-Arton 1959-1964) and from 1983 to 1992 \n(Michael Fallon).  Between 1950 to 1997 the constituency was won by more than 5,000 votes \non only one occasion.  In 1992 Alan Milburn won the seat from Michael Fallon by 2,798 \n(Fallon went on to become the MP for Sevenoaks, in Kent).  Milburn held the seat at the \nthree subsequent elections and the seat is generally regarded as a safe Labour seat at the \nmoment. \nIn his Parliamentary career Alan Milburn was a front bench spokesman for the Labour Party \nfrom 1995 until 1997.  Following Labour’s general election victory in 1997 he was appointed \na Minister of State at the Department of Health.  The following year he was promoted to the \n3 \n\n\nCabinet and held three different posts, including Health Secretary, before resigning as a \nMinister in 2005.  In June 2009 he announced his intention not to seek re-election to the \nHouse of Commons at the next general election to “pursue challenges other than politics”.1 \nAt the 2010 general election the Darlington constituency was won by Jenny Chapman of the \nLabour Party.  She won with a majority of 3,388 votes. \n2 Early Representation \nUnlike many of the ancient counties, the people of Durham were not directly represented in \nParliament until the sixteenth century, in the reign of Henry VIII.  Parliaments of the knights of \nthe shires were summoned by the Monarch from the thirteenth century.  It was these \nParliaments summoned by writ to meet that were generally regarded as the first assemblies \nof representatives.2  County Durham was a County Palatine.  This is defined as “county or \nother territory in England…as having a ruler with royal privileges and judicial authority (within \nthe territory) which elsewhere belong to the sovereign alone”.3  Durham’s status as a County \nPalatine dates back to the Norman period and the power was held by the Bishops of Durham \nwho had the title Prince Bishop to denote the royal authority they exercised.  The Prince \nBishop held civil and military power and established courts and issued money.  Part of the \nreason for these special privileges was the proximity to Scotland and the remoteness from \nthe Monarch.  In an emergency the Prince Bishop could act to protect the county without \ndelay.4   \nCounty Durham appears in the returns twice in the Parliaments of 1654 and 1656.  These \nwere the Protectorate Parliaments that followed Oliver Cromwell’s Instrument of Government \nthat declared Cromwell Lord Protector.  The Instrument was an attempt to redistribute seats \non a more equitable basis.5  Durham’s representation was suspended following the \nRestoration in 1660 and power returned to the Prince Bishop but Members were again \nreturned to the Parliament of 1661 summoned by Charles II.  An Act of Parliament in 1672 \nconfirmed both the city and county of Durham’s representation in the English Parliament from \n1678.6  The returns for Durham for Cromwell’s Parliament summoned in 1654 did not survive \nbut the two county Members from the 1656 Parliament are named as Thomas Lilburne and \nJames Clavering.7  The pattern of representation remained unaltered until the reforms of \n1832, with four Members returned to Parliament, two to represent the county and two to \nrepresent the city of Durham. \n3 Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century Changes \n3.1 Great Reform Act of 1832 \nThe Representation of the People Act 1832 was the Act that reformed the distribution of \nseats in England and Wales. It introduced the principle of splitting the shire counties into \ndivisions and returning two Members for each division rather than for the whole county and it \nalso reformed the Parliamentary boroughs that were entitled to send Members to \n \n \n1  Gaby Hinsliff, The Observer, June 2009, p13 \n2  House of Commons Information Office, Factsheet G3 A Brief Chronology of the House of Commons. \n3  http://dictionary.oed.com/entrance.dtl accessed 22 April 2008. \n4  Robert Surtees, History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham, 1816-40, ppxv-xvii \n5  Ivan Roots, The Great Rebellion 1642-1660, 1995, pp181-9 \n6  J Holladay Philbin, Parliamentary Representation 1832: England and Wales, 1965, pp67-70 \n7  House of Commons, Returns of Parliament Vol I 1213-1702, Ordered to be printed 1 March 1878 \n4 \n\n\nParliament.8  The City of Durham retained its status as a Parliamentary borough with the \nright to return two Members.  In addition Sunderland was established as a two Member \nParliamentary borough, and Gateshead and South Shields became single Member \nParliamentary boroughs.  Darlington was not granted separate Parliamentary representation. \nDurham was divided into two divisions, each of which returned two MPs.  The Boundary \nCommission proposals that followed the Act, published in 1832, made recommendations on \nthe boundaries of the Parliamentary boroughs and divisions of counties that had been listed \nin Schedule F.9  The recommendations of the Boundary Commission were implemented by \nthe Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832.10  These changes gave the county a total of ten \nseats in the reformed House of Commons.  This was an increase of six from the pre-1832 \narrangements. \nThe county was already divided into four wards and the Boundary Commission decided to \nuse them to split the county.  The Northern division of the county comprised the Chester and \nEasington wards, with the Southern division comprised of the Darlington and Stockton wards.  \nBoth divisions of the county were exclusive of the areas included within the four \nParliamentary boroughs.  They also excluded the isolated parts of Durham that lay between \nNewcastle and Berwick.  Those areas, Norhamshire, Islandshire and Bedlingtonshire were \nannexed to Northumberland for the purposes of Parliamentary representation.  This meant \nthat Darlington was represented by the two MPs for the Southern division of the county of \nDurham after 1832. \n3.2 Boundary Commission Review 1868 \nThe 1868 review carried out by the Boundary Commission followed the Representation of the \nPeople Act 1867. This Act appointed the Commission to inquire into the boundaries of the \nnew boroughs created by the Act; the counties the Act had newly divided, and to review all \nother existing boroughs that had not been disenfranchised by the Act. In inquiring into \nexisting boroughs, the Commissioners had the power to recommend extension of borough \nboundaries if it thought this was appropriate. This Act also increased the number of Members \nrepresenting each of the growing industrial cities of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and \nLiverpool, from two to three.11 The Commissioners conducted local inquiries and reported in \n1868. \nIn county Durham none of the existing Parliamentary boroughs were abolished and the \nnumbers of seats in these boroughs were left unchanged.  The city of Durham and \nSunderland had their boundaries extended but South Shields was unaltered.  Three new \nParliamentary boroughs were created:  Darlington, the Hartlepools, and Stockton.  All three \nwere designated single Member boroughs.   \nThe two county divisions remained unaltered except for those areas that had been absorbed \ninto the extended or newly created Parliamentary boroughs.  This meant that the total \nnumber of Members in the county increased to thirteen as a result of the creation of the three \nnew boroughs. \nThe new Parliamentary borough of Darlington was temporarily defined as comprising the \ntownships of Darlington, Haughton-le-Skerne, and Cockerton by the RPA 1867.  However, \n \n \n8  Representation of the People Act 1832, (2 Will 4, chapter 45) \n9  Parliamentary Representation Boundary Reports in Eighteen Volumes, 1831-2 \n10  Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832 (2 and 3 Will 4 chapter 64) \n11  Representation of the People Act 1867 (30 and 31 Vict chapter 102) \n5 \n\n\nthe Boundary Act 1868, which implemented any alterations resulting from the Boundary \nCommission inquiries, defined the Parliamentary borough of Darlington as being the same as \nthe municipal borough of Darlington.12  This excluded Cockerton and Haughton.  It also \nexcluded Blackwell in the south.  The western boundary was Baydale Beck, with Cocker \nBeck forming the north western boundary.  In the north east the river Skerne marked the \nborough boundary and the northern limit of the borough, along the North Road, was \napproximately where Thompson Street is today.  The southern boundary approximated to the \nmodern route of Consicliffe Road in the west but extended further south in the east to include \nthe area around the modern location of Darlington Cricket Club.  A small area of Oxen-le-\nFields was administratively part of Darlington but was excluded from the Parliamentary \nborough. \nThe boundaries of Darlington implemented in 1868 meant that some parts of the modern \nconstituency lay beyond the boundary.  These areas continued to be represented by the two \nMPs for the Southern division of the county of Durham. \n3.3 Boundary Commission Review 1885 \nThe next review occurred in 1885. In major cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham \nthere was a major change to the distribution of seats. Until now these had been \nparliamentary boroughs returning multiple members. The Redistribution of Seats Bill made \nprovision for larger boroughs to be divided into single Member divisions. A Boundary \nCommission was established to recommend boundaries while the Bill was still going through \nParliament. The Commission was appointed in November 1884 and reported in February \n1885.13 The recommendations were incorporated into the Bill which became the \nRedistribution of Seats Act 1885.14 \nThere were two alterations to the Parliamentary boroughs in the county of Durham.  Durham \ncity was reduced to a single Member seat and the borough of Darlington had its boundaries \naltered. \nThe Act also altered representation in many of the counties.  Several counties were divided \ninto single Member divisions. Durham was one such county and the Act divided the areas of \nthe county not included in Parliamentary boroughs into eight divisions.  This gave the county \na total of sixteen Members, a net increase of three.  The constituencies created contained a \nmix of petty sessional divisions and parishes.  Petty sessional divisions were the \ngeographical area of operation of magistrates’ courts within counties for the administration of \nlocal summary justice.  These have since been replaced by fewer and larger modern petty \nsessional areas.15 \nThe borough boundaries of Darlington had not grown significantly so the area of the \nParliamentary borough saw only minor adjustment.  The areas not included in the borough \nformed part of a new constituency named South East Durham. \n \n \n12  Boundary Act 1868 ( 31 and 32 Vict chapter 46) \n13  Boundary Commission for England and Wales Report, C 4287, 1885 \n14  Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 (48 & 49 Vict chapter 23) \n15   Bryan Gibson, Introduction to the Magistrates’ Court, 4th Ed, 2001, pp14,17 \n6 \n\n\n3.4 Boundary Commission Review 1917 \nThe next Boundary Commission review reported in 1917,16 and the results were incorporated \ninto the Representation of the People Act 1918.17 The Act made many changes to \nconstituencies and elections in the UK. \nIn this review the Boundary Commission used local government administrative areas, as they \nexisted at the time, to construct constituencies.  There was also far less detail printed than in \nmodern reviews.  This makes direct comparison with other reviews difficult. \nIn Durham county, the city of Durham was abolished as a Parliamentary borough and was \nmerged into the county seats.  The other six boroughs were retained, with Sunderland \nretaining two Members and all the others each returning a single Member.  The county at \nlarge was divided into eleven single Member constituencies.  This gave the county a total of \neighteen seats. \nThe Parliamentary borough of Darlington was extended to include the whole of the municipal \nborough of Darlington, which had grown since the 1885 review.  The borough had been \nextended to include most of Cockerton and parts of Haughton, although most of Haughton \nremained as a separate parish.  This meant that an increased area of the modern \nconstituency was within the boundaries of the Parliamentary borough created by this review.  \nThe areas not included in the borough, including the parish of Haughton, formed part of a \nnew constituency named Sedgefield. \n4 Boundary Commission Periodical Reviews \nThe regular reviews of Parliamentary constituencies have their origins in the House of \nCommons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944. This Act instructed the Boundary Commission \nfor England to conduct an initial review of all seats with a view to keeping them under \nconstant review. One of the Rules in this review was that all two Member boroughs should be \ndivided and return a single Member for each division unless the Commission felt it \n“undesirable to divide it”. The recommendations of the initial review were published in \n1947.18 This formed the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1948.19 The following \nyear the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 was passed, which repealed \nthe 1944 Act, but took the principle of periodic review forward and established the rules for \nthe reviews. 20  \n \nIn county Durham the situation in the Parliamentary boroughs remained largely unaltered.  \nThe only real difference was that Sunderland was split into two single Member constituencies \nrather than the whole borough returning two Members, as had been the case since 1832.  \nThe other five Parliamentary boroughs continued to be single Member constituencies.  The \nremaining parts of the county were divided into ten single Member constituencies.  This was \na reduction of one. \nBy the time of the Initial Review the borough of Darlington had grown again.  The boundaries \nof the constituency of Darlington were adjusted to make them coterminous with the borough.  \nIt meant that the constituency boundaries were recognisable as those that still exist today.  \n \n16  Boundary Commission (England & Wales) Report and Appendices, Cd 8756, 1917 \n17  Representation of the People Act 1918, (7 & 8 Geo V, chapter 64) \n18  Boundary Commission for England Constituted in accordance with the House of Commons (Redistribution of \nSeat) Act 1944 Initial Report, Cmd 7260, October 1947 \n19  Representation of the People Act 1948, (11 & 12 Geo 6, chapter 65) \n20  The House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 (12 & 13 Geo 6 chapter 66) \n7 \n\n\nThe maps provided with the earlier reviews are not sufficiently detailed to draw exact \nconclusions but only a small number of electors currently in the Darlington constituency \nwould have been beyond the constituency boundary at this time.  The area surrounding \nDarlington was again allocated to the Sedgefield constituency. \n4.1 First Periodical Review \nThe first full periodical review followed in 1953-4 with the report published in 1954.21  This \nreview divided the Gateshead constituency and altered the Jarrow constituency.  The \nremaining fifteen constituencies were unaltered.  These new boundaries were first used in \nthe 1955 general election. \n4.2 Second Periodical Review \nThe Second Periodical Review was published in 1969, having commenced in February \n1965.22  Since the previous review the county borough of Teesside had been created.  This \ncovered the Redcar, Middlesborough, Stockton and Thornaby area and the borough was part \nof the North Riding of Yorkshire.  This meant Stockton was no longer considered part of \nDurham.  As a result the county was allocated one seat fewer than in the previous review, \ntaking the county total to sixteen \nThe Boundary Commission noted that a Royal Commission on local government in England \nwas likely to make major changes to the Tyneside area so the Commission decided to make \nas little alteration as possible to the Parliamentary constituency boundaries in this review.  \nThe Darlington constituency was adjusted to realign the constituency boundaries with the \nborough boundaries, which had been altered in 1967.  The Boundary Commission report \nnoted this as a minor change but gave no detail.  The area surrounding the Darlington \nconstituency was transferred to the Bishop Auckland constituency following the abolition of \nthe Sedgefield constituency. \nThe 1969 recommendations were not implemented until after the 1970 general election, so \nthe new boundaries were not used until the general elections of 1974. For more detail see \nResearch Paper 92/61 The Parliamentary Boundary Commissions and the Boundary \nCommissions Bill.  \n4.3 Third Periodical Review \nThe next periodical review commenced in 1976, and the report was published in 1983.23  \nSince the last review the Local Government Act 1972 had been implemented, which had \naltered many of the administrative boundaries across the country.  This had a significant \nimpact on the county of Durham.  The Tyneside areas of Gateshead, Jarrow and South \nShields, in the north of the county, were combined with Sunderland, Houghton and \nWashington and transferred to the new metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear.  A new non-\nmetropolitan county of Cleveland was created southeast of Durham.  Hartlepool and the rural \ndistrict of Stockton were transferred to Cleveland.  The remainder of the old county of \nDurham was combined with the rural district of Startforth, in the old North Riding Yorkshire, to \ncreate a new county of Durham.24 \n \n \n21  Boundary Commission for England First Periodical Report, Cmd 9311, November 1954 \n22  Boundary Commission for England Second Periodical Report, Cmnd 4084, June 1969 \n23  Boundary Commission for England Third Periodical Report, Cmnd 8797, February 1983 \n24  Local Government Act 1972 (chapter 70) \n8 \n\n\nThe Act also revised the local administrative structure within the modified county.  It defined \nthe area covered by the county, but gave the Secretary of State for the Environment the \npower to define and name the new structure of local councils by order at a later date.  The \nmunicipal boroughs and rural districts were abolished and new districts were created using \nthe definitions contained in the English Non-metropolitan District (Definition) Order 1972.25  \nThe existing borough of Darlington was merged with part of the surrounding rural district to \nform the new borough of Darlington.26  New local electoral wards were then implemented in \n1976.27 \nThe Boundary Commission allocated the modified county seven constituencies.  The \nBoundary Commission initially recommended that the Darlington constituency should be \nenlarged to include three of the five rural wards that now formed part of the new borough of \nDarlington, Hurworth, Middleton St George, and Sadberge as they existed at the time.  \nFollowing a local inquiry the proposal was dropped and the Darlington constituency was \nretained with the same boundaries as before and comprised all but five wards of the borough \nof Darlington.  The five rural wards of the borough of Darlington were instead allocated to the \nSedgefield constituency re-established as a result of this review.  The new boundaries were \nimplemented by order in 1983.28 They were used in the 1983, 1987 and 1992 general \nelections. \n4.4 Fourth Periodical Review \nThe Fourth Periodical Review commenced in February 1991 and reported to Parliament in \nJune 1995.29  Durham was allocated seven seats.  The Darlington constituency was \nunaltered by the review and continued to comprise all but five of the borough’s wards.  The \nfive rural wards remained allocated to the Sedgefield constituency although there were \nboundary changes elsewhere in the Sedgefield constituency.  These boundaries were \nimplemented by order in 199530, and used in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections. \n4.5 Fifth Periodical Review \nThe Fifth Periodical Review of constituencies in England commenced in February 2000 and \nwas published in February 2007.  The final recommendations adopted by the Commission \nand approved by Parliament were used at the 2010 general election. \nThere had been two significant developments in the county by the time of the Fifth Review.  \nAll the local government districts of the county had been re-warded in 1999 along with those \nof Darlington in 2001.31  The Boundary Commission had to realign boundaries to take into \naccount any alterations that had led to Parliamentary boundaries no longer being \ncoterminous with ward boundaries.  In addition the Durham (Borough of Darlington) \n(Structural Changes) Order 1995 had created the new unitary authority of Darlington, which \nnow had county status in its own right, and was no longer administratively part of the county \nof Durham.32 \n \n \n25  English Non-metropolitan District (Definition) Order 1972 SI 1972/2039 \n26  English Non-metropolitan District (Names) Order 1973 SI 1973/551 \n27   Borough of Darlington (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1976 SI 1976/832 \n28  Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1983, SI 1983/417 \n29  Boundary Commission for England Fourth Periodical Report, Cm 433, 6 June 1995 \n30  Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1995, SI 1995/1626 \n31  Borough of Darlington (Electoral Changes) Order 2001 SI 2001/3357 \n32  Durham (Borough of Darlington) (Structural Changes) Order 1995 SI 1995/1772 \n9 \n\n\nThe Boundary Commission decided to review county Durham and Darlington together.  They \nnoted that it would not affect the overall allocation of seats, but by reviewing the areas \ntogether the option of minimal changes would be available.  If Darlington had been reviewed \nas a separate review area this would have required greater disruption to Parliamentary \nboundaries. \nIn the Darlington constituency the Boundary Commission recommended that there should be \nminimal realignment to the constituency boundaries to take into account the new ward \nboundaries.  This required two alterations.  The Harrowgate Hill ward had been enlarged to \ntake in an area formerly in the Whessoe ward.  The Harrowgate ward remained allocated to \nthe Darlington constituency which meant that 375 electors were transferred from the \nSedgefield constituency to the Darlington constituency.  A new ward named Faverdale had \nbeen created and it too included an area formerly included in the Whessoe wards as well as \nincluding some of the old Cockerton East ward.  The Faverdale ward was allocated to the \nDarlington constituency which meant 295 electors were transferred to the Darlington \nconstituency. \nA local inquiry into the proposals for Durham and Darlington was required.  The principal \nissue in relation to Darlington was whether Darlington should be reviewed separately or as \npart of the combined review area.  If Darlington was reviewed as a single area it would \nproduce a single constituency coterminous with the borough.  The Assistant Commissioner \nconducting the inquiry reported that this would not necessarily produce an excessive \ndisparity in the electorates of the constituencies in Durham and Darlington but there was \nsignificant approval for the Commission’s initial recommendations to keep the four rural \nwards of Darlington in the Sedgefield constituency (the ward restructuring had reduced the \nnumber of wards covering the rural parts of Darlington from five to four).  The Assistant \nCommissioner therefore recommended that the Commission’s initial proposals for Darlington \nshould stand and be adopted as the final recommendation to be put to Parliament. \nThe draft Order approving the Boundary Commission’s final recommendations was laid \nbefore Parliament on 26 February 2007 and was subject to the affirmative procedure. The \nHouse of Commons considered the draft Order on 27 March 2007 in the Fourth Delegated \nLegislation Committee33 and was formally approved by the House on 16 April 2007.34  The \nHouse of Lords approved the draft Order on 17 May 200735 with the approved Order being \nmade on 13 June 2007 and coming into force 14 days after that.36  The full details of the \nprovisional recommendations and the local inquiry can be viewed on an archive of the \nBoundary Commission website.37 \n \n \n33  SC Deb (4DLC) 27 March 2007 c3-26 \n34  HC Deb 16 April 2007, c131-2 \n35  HL Deb 17 May 2007, c380-3 \n36  Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order  SI 2007/1681 \n37  http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100221151902/http://www.boundarycommissionforenglan \nd.org.uk/index.shtml \n10 \n\n\n5 Previous Members \nThe following lists give details of Members who have represented the area now broadly \ncovered by the constituency.38,39,40,41  For biographical details of Members pre-1979 see \nStenton and Lees’ various volumes.42 Biographical details of Members from 1979 – 2010 are \navailable in Research Paper 2010/33 Members 1979 - 2010.43 \n1832-1885 Southern Durham (County division with two seats) \nDates Election Members Party \n1832 General election Joseph Pease  \nJohn Bowes \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1835 General election John Bowes  \nJoseph Pease \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1837 General election John Bowes \nJoseph Pease \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1841 General election Lord Harry Vane \nJohn Bowes \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1847 General election James Farrer \nLord Harry Vane \nConservative \nLiberal \n1852 General election James Farrer \nLord Harry Vane \nConservative \nLiberal \n1857 General election Henry Pease \nLord Harry Vane \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1859 General election James Farrer \nHenry Pease \nConservative \nLiberal \n1865 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nCharles Surtees \nLiberal \nConservative \n \n \n38  FWS Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1932 – 1885, 1977; British Parliamentary Results 1885-\n1918, 1974;  British Parliamentary Election Results 1918 - 1949, 1983; British Parliamentary Election Results  \n1950 – 1973,  1983; British Parliamentary Election Results 1974 – 1983, 1984 \n39  Rallings and Thrasher, British Parliamentary Election Results 1983 – 1997, 1999, Britain Votes 6: British \nParliamentary Election Results, 1997, 1998 \n40  Electoral Commission, Election 2001: The Official Results, 2001 \n41  Times Guide to the House of Commons 2005, 2005 \n42  Stenton and Lees, Who’s Who of British Members of Parliament Volume I, 1832-1885, 1976; Who’s Who of \nBritish Members of Parliament Volume II 1886-1918, 1978;Who’s Who of British Members of Parliament \nVolume III 1919-1945, 1979 and Who’s Who of British Members of Parliament Volume IV1945-79, 1981 \n43  Oonagh Gay, House of Commons Library Research Paper 2010/33, Members 1979 - 2010 \n11 \n\n\n1868 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nFrederick Beaumont \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1874 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nFrederick Beaumont \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1880 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nHon.

The information contained in this Note is no longer current, following the fall of the\nSaddam Hussein regime in April 2003. It provides historical information on the ‘no-fly\nzones’ over northern and southern Iraq, which were imposed by the USA and UK in the\naftermath of the Gulf War of 1991. The Note looks at the legal basis cited by Washington\nand London for the zones and summarises the main incidents that occurred between\nSeptember 2001 and March 2003.\nContents\nA. Background 2\nB. Debate over the Legal Basis 2\nC. Operations in the No-Fly Zones 5\nD. Summary of Activity since 11 September 2001 8\n\n\n2A. Background\nThe United States, the United Kingdom and France cited humanitarian reasons for the\nestablishment of the ‘no-fly zones’ over northern and southern Iraq, claiming the zones were\nrequired to help protect the Kurdish and Shi'ite populations from attack by Iraqi government\nforces at the end of the Gulf War.\nThe northern zone north of the 36th parallel was introduced in April 1991 as part of Operation\nProvide Comfort to provide humanitarian assistance to the Kurdish population in northern\nIraq. The no-fly zone operation, renamed Northern Watch in January 1997, involves\napproximately 45 aircraft from the United States, the United Kingdom and Turkey.\nMonitoring of the southern zone, called Operation Southern Watch, commenced in August\n1992, to help protect the Shi’ite population of southern Iraq. The zone initially covered the\narea south of the 32nd parallel. Following incursions by Iraqi forces into the Kurdish area in\n1996, the zone was extended northwards to the 33rd parallel.\nUS and British aircraft currently patrol the southern zone, which covers approximately one-\nthird of Iraq. France refused to participate in patrolling north of the 32nd parallel and halted\nall participation after Operation Desert Fox, the joint US-UK four-day campaign of air strikes\nagainst Iraq in December 1998.\nThe zones restrict Iraqi military activity in the north and south of the country by keeping\naircraft grounded, hindering the deployment of air defence radars and surface-to-air missiles\nand allowing the US and UK to monitor any large-scale deployments by Iraqi ground-forces.\nIraq rejects the zones, claiming they have no basis in UN Security Council Resolutions. An\nIraqi spokesman said on 5 January 1999:\nImposing the so-called no-fly zones is illegal…it is a flagrant violation of\ninternational laws, norms and charters, particularly the UN Charter. Moreover, it is a\nflagrant violation of the Security Council resolutions [which] underline the need to\nrespect Iraq's sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity.1\nB. Debate over the Legal Basis\nThe precise legal basis of the zones is the subject of some debate. British and American\nofficials point to Security Council Resolution 688 of 5 April 1991, which demands that Iraq\nend the repression of its civilian population and appeals to all Member States to contribute to\nhumanitarian relief efforts.2 Russia insists that the zones are not in fact backed by specific\nresolutions, arguing that Resolution 688 was not adopted under Chapter VII of the UN\nCharter, which concerns action with respect to threats to or breaches of international peace\n1 BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, 7 January 1999\n2 S/RES/688 (1991)\n\n\n3and security, and which allows the Security Council to authorise the use of force. London\nand Washington hold that the zones remain of vital importance as a “necessary humanitarian\nmeasure” to deter further internal repression by Baghdad.3 It is argued that the Iraqi\ngovernment’s record of internal repression, such as the use of poison gas on Kurdish civilians\nin 1988, underlines the importance of maintaining the zones.\nThe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Ben\nBradshaw, gave the following account of the no-fly zones in a Written Answer of 29 April\n2002.\nThe no-fly zones were established in support of UNSCR 688. This called on Iraq to\nend its brutal repression of Kurds and other minority groups in the north and of the\nShia community in the south. The no-fly zones were set up in response to a grave\nhumanitarian crisis and they prevent Saddam Hussein from once again using his air\npower against the civilian population in those areas.4\nThe full text of Resolution 688 is reproduced below:\nS/RES/0688 (1991)\n5 April 1991\nRESOLUTION 688 (1991)\nAdopted by the Security Council at its 2982nd meeting on 5 April 1991\nThe Security Council,\nMindful of its duties and its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\nRecalling the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter of the United\nNations,\nGravely concerned by the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of\nIraq, including most recently in Kurdish populated areas, which led to a massive flow\nof refugees towards and across international frontiers and to cross-border incursions,\nwhich threaten international peace and security in the region,\nDeeply disturbed by the magnitude of the human suffering involved,\nTaking note of the letters sent by the representatives of Turkey and France to the\nUnited Nations dated 2 April 1991 and 4 April 1991, respectively (S/22435 and\nS/22442),\n3 Financial Times, 2 February 1999\n4 HC Deb 29 April 2002, c581-2w\n\n\n4Taking note also of the letters sent by the Permanent Representative of the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran to the United Nations dated 3 and 4 April 1991, respectively\n(S/22436 and S/22447),\nReaffirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty, territorial\nintegrity and political independence of Iraq and of all States in the area,\nBearing in mind the Secretary-General's report of 20 March 1991 (S/22366),\n1. Condemns the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of Iraq,\nincluding most recently in Kurdish populated areas, the consequences of which\nthreaten international peace and security in the region;\n2. Demands that Iraq, as a contribution to remove the threat to international peace and\nsecurity in the region, immediately end this repression and express the hope in the\nsame context that an open dialogue will take place to ensure that the human and\npolitical rights of all Iraqi citizens are respected;\n3. Insists that Iraq allow immediate access by international humanitarian\norganizations to all those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq and to make\navailable all necessary facilities for their operations;\n4. Requests the Secretary-General to pursue his humanitarian efforts in Iraq and to\nreport forthwith, if appropriate on the basis of a further mission to the region, on the\nplight of the Iraqi civilian population, and in particular the Kurdish population,\nsuffering from the repression in all its forms inflicted by the Iraqi authorities;\n5. Requests further the Secretary-General to use all the resources at his disposal,\nincluding those of the relevant United Nations agencies, to address urgently the\ncritical needs of the refugees and displaced Iraqi population;\n6. Appeals to all Member States and to all humanitarian organizations to contribute to\nthese humanitarian relief efforts;\n7. Demands that Iraq cooperate with the Secretary-General to these ends;\n8. Decides to remain seized of the matter.5\n5 S/RES/0688, 5 April 1991, from\nhttp://daccess-ods.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/596/24/IMG/NR059624.pdf?OpenElement\n\n\n5C. Operations in the No-Fly Zones\nIn a Written Answer on 17 December 1998, the then Secretary of State for Defence, George\nRobertson, stated:\nSince patrolling of the northern and southern Iraqi No-Fly-Zones began…the RAF\nhave flown some 15,500 sorties in the zones.6\nIn a further Written Answer on 5 June 2000, the then Parliamentary Under Secretary for\nDefence, John Spellar, outlined specific figures for the following year:\nBetween April 1999 and March 2000 RAF aircraft flew a total of 2,683 sorties in the\nno-fly zones; 450 in the northern no-fly zone and 2,233 in the southern no-fly zone.7\nWith regard to American involvement in the no-fly zones, Lt. Col. Phillip Gibbons of the\nWashington Institute for Near East Policy wrote on 1 July 2002 that:\nSince 1991, the United States has averaged over 34,000 military sorties per year in\nsupport of no-fly zone operations in Iraq.8\nThe cost to the UK of enforcing the individual no-fly zones was outlined in a Written Answer\non 16 February 1999 by the then Secretary of State for Defence, George Robertson:\nEnforcement of the northern and southern no-fly-zones over Iraq began in 1991 and\n1992 respectively. The annual additional costs of each operation since that time are as\nfollows:\n(£ million)\nYear North South\n1991-92 2.6 --\n1992-93 4.2 5.3\n1993-94 9.6 6.5\n1994-95 10.5 4.6\n1995-96 5.9 4.7\n1996-97 2.3 4.1\n1997-98 2.3 3.4\n1998-99 (1) 3.2 7.6\n6 HC Deb 17 December 1998 c652\n7 HC Deb 5 June 2000 c3w\n8 Lt. Col. Phillip Gibbons, ‘U.S. No-Fly Zones in Iraq: to what end?’, Policy Watch No.632, 1 July 2002,\nWashington Institute for Near East Policy, from http://www.iraqwatch.org/perspectives/winep-pw632-\ngibbons-070102.htm\n\n\n6(1) The figures for 1998-99 are estimates. The southern no-fly-zone estimate for this\nyear takes account of the deployment of RAF aircraft to Kuwait as well as Saudi\nArabia.9\nHowever, beyond 1999 more precise figures are unavailable. The Minister for the Armed\nForces, Adam Ingram, stated in a Written Answer on 7 November 2002:\nOur records do not separately identify expenditure incurred in maintaining the no fly\nzones. However, the table below sets out the overall additional expenditure incurred\nby the Ministry of Defence as a direct result of operations in the Gulf from 1992-1993\nonwards.\nYear Million\n1992-93 551\n1993-94 179\n1994-95 58\n1995-96 14\n1996-97 6\n1997-98 16\n1998-99 35\n1999-2000 28\n2000-01 25\n2001-02 (estimate) 221\n2002-03 (estimate) 261\nNote: 1 denotes figure calculated on a resource basis; all previous figures are cash-\nbased.\nI will write to my hon. Friend concerning expenditure in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003\nand a copy of my letter will be placed in the Library of the House.10\nSince 1998 there has been an increase in military activity by coalition aircraft operating in the\nnorthern and southern no-fly zones. The United States European Command has stated:\nCoalition aircraft have been enforcing the northern no-fly-zone for more than 10\nyears. Since December 1998, Saddam Hussein has opted to challenge this\nenforcement by firing at coalition aircraft with surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and\nanti-aircraft artillery and by targeting them with radar…aircraft respond in self-\ndefence to these threats, while continuing to enforce the no-fly-zones.11\n9 HC Deb 16 February 1999 c610W\n10 HC Deb 7 November 2002, c468W\n11 United States European Command, Operation Northern Watch website. Available at:\nhttp://www.eucom.mil/Directorates/ECPA/index.htm?http://www.eucom.mil/Directorates/ECPA/Operations\n/onw/onw.htm&2\n\n\n7Since the end of February 2003 there has been a marked increase in allied activity in the no-\nfly zones, which has prompted many analysts and commentators to suggest that the no-fly\nzones are being used by the US and UK to launch pre-emptive strikes ahead of a possible\nconflict.\nAn article in The Guardian, commented:\nBritain and the United States have all but fired the first shots of the second Gulf War\nby dramatically extending the range of targets in the no-fly zones over Iraq to soften\nup the country for an allied ground invasion […]\nAnalysts confirm that there has been an intensification of what is known as “the\nundeclared war” […]\nLoren Thompson, a defence analyst with the US Lexington Institute, told Reuters:\n“The US military is taking advantage of the no-fly zones to prepare the battlespace\nfor war. There’s been a sporadic war occurring in the air over Iraq for a dozen years\nnow. This merely ratchets up the intensity”.12\nIn response to these allegations the Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, stated during\nOral Questions on 3 March 2003:\nAs I said a few moments ago, our forces have been undertaking more frequent patrols\nin the no-fly zones with a broader range of aircraft. However, I assure my hon. Friend\nthat they do that in response to efforts to attack them and act entirely in self-defence,\nin accordance with international law […] the arrangements for patrolling the southern\nand northern no-fly zones remain unchanged. As he would expect, our forces are\nauthorised to deal with any threats that Iraqi forces pose to them.13\n12\n“Allies bomb key Iraqi targets: ‘Undeclared war’ enters new phase”, The Guardian, 3 March 2003\n13 HC Deb 3 March 2003, c565\n\n\n8D.

          "Controls on Firearms:\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Bill\nResearch Paper 96/102\n8 November 1996\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Bill [Bill 10 of 1996-97] will be debated on Second Reading on\nNovember 12 1996. This paper considers the background to and provisions of the Bill, which\narises from measures proposed by the Government in response to the report of The Public\nInquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996 Cm 3386. The\ninquiry was chaired by Lord Cullen and published on October 16 1996. The Bill does not\nextend to Northern Ireland. \nMary Baber\nHome Affairs Section\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nSummary\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Bill [Bill 10 of 1996-97] is designed to implement proposals set\nout in the Government's response to the report of the public inquiry chaired by Lord Cullen\ninto the shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996. The intention behind the\nBill is to ban handguns above .22 calibre and permit members of the public to own handguns\ntaking .22 rimfire cartridges, provided that these are stored in secure conditions in gun clubs\nlicensed under new procedures. There will be limited exemptions for certain categories of\npeople, including vets who need to put down animals humanely, people who work in\nslaughterhouses, race officials at athletic meetings and people with trophies of war obtained\nbefore 1946. Other provisions in the Bill are also aimed at tightening the current certification\nprocedures carried out by the police, placing the onus on individuals to satisfy the police that\nthey are fit to hold a firearm safely and giving the police powers to revoke certificates where\nthey consider that the applicant no longer has good reason for possessing a firearm. The Bill\nalso contains provisions brought forward by the Government in addition to those covered by\nLord Cullen, including a ban on expanding ammunition except for the purposes of lawfully\nshooting deer and vermin control, a curb on mail order sales of firearms and a requirement\nfor gun owners to inform the police if they buy, sell, destroy, transfer or de-activate any gun.\nThis paper sets out a brief history of gun control in this country and goes on to describe the\ncurrent controls and certification procedures under the Firearms Act 1968 as amended and\nhow these will be affected by the Bill. It also explains the current approval procedures for gun\nclubs and the provisions in the Bill under which the clubs will have to be licensed.\nThe Government has said that compensation will be paid to owners of guns which are to be\nprohibited by the Bill, based on the market value of the guns before October 16th 1996.\nLicensed firearms dealers will also be compensated for stocks of prohibited weapons which\nthey wish to surrender.This paper discusses the question of compensation for firearms and the\nuse of firearms amnesties.\nIt has been asserted by some commentators that the Bill of Rights 1689 may affect statutory\nattempts at gun control. This paper considers these assertions and the wider discussion about\nthe current status of the 1689 Bill. \nThis paper includes a brief summary of controls on firearms in Northern Ireland, although the\nFirearms (Amendment ) Bill does not extend there.\n\n\nCONTENTS\nPage\nA.

Brief outline of the history of the control of firearms in Great\nBritain\nBefore the Firearms Act 1920, there was virtually no control over the sale and possession of\nguns. In his evidence to the Home Affairs Committee in 1996, the specialist adviser, Mr\nColin Greenwood, commented that:1\nDuring the early part of this century anyone, respectable citizen, criminal or lunatic, could\nwalk into a gunshop and buy any firearm he wanted. The law prohibited sales to persons who\nwere drunk at the time, and those wishing to buy a pistol would have been required to call\nfirst at a post office to obtain a 10 shilling licence. Despite that, statistics provided by the\nCommissioner of Police for the Metropolis showed that the use of it in crime was very rare\nindeed.\nThe 1920 Act, passed at a time of concern about the quantities of weapons available after the\nfirst World War, made it an offence to buy, possess, use or carry rifles and pistols or their\nammunition without a certificate from a chief officer of police, who had to be sure that an\napplicant had a good reason for acquiring the firearm and could be permitted to have it\nwithout danger to public safety. The Firearms Amendment Act 1936 strengthened\narrangements for the issue of certificates by enabling conditions to be attached to them;\nbrought weapons such as short-barrelled shot guns within the control and prescribed stringent\ncontrols on continuous fire weapons such as machine guns. Shotguns remained outside the\nsystem of controls.\nIn 1962 the Air Guns and Shot Guns Etc. Act restricted the use of such weapons by young\npersons. The Firearms Act 1965, described by Mr Greenwood as \"...clearly a panic reaction\nto the abolition of the death penalty\"2, substantially increased the penalties for offences\ninvolving firearms and created new offences of carrying firearms in public places or while\ntrespassing.\nPart V of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 made it an offence to buy or possess a shot gun\nwithout a certificate issued by a chief officer of police, but there was no requirement to have\na good reason for wanting one. This, and all previous legislation on the control of firearms\nin England, Scotland and Wales was consolidated in the Firearms Act 1968.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 1995-96 HC 393-II p.109\n2 ibid, p.110\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nIn 1973, a consultative document was issued by the Home Office which made wide-ranging\nproposals based on the report of Sir John McKay's working party set up in 1970. Mr\nGreenwood, in his memorandum to the Home Affairs Committee, commented that the first\nconclusion of the unpublished report that a reduction in the number of firearms in private\nhands was a desirable end in itself, was not included in the green paper.3\nThis proposed that self-loading rifles and pump-action and repeater shot guns should be\nmoved into the prohibited category and that additions should be able to be made by order;\nthat another order-making power should be introduced to achieve greater consistency in\ndeciding what was a good reason for possessing \"Section 1\" firearms, but the most far-\nreaching of suggested changes were those relating to shot guns which, it proposed, should be\nsubject to the same controls as rifles and pistols under s.1 of the 1968 Act. The proposal met\nwith considerable opposition from the shooting community and time was not found for the\nnecessary legislation.\nIn 1987, the tragic events at Hungerford which resulted in the deaths of 16 people killed by\na single gunman precipitated further consideration of changes to the 1968 Act. The gunman,\nMichael Ryan, was lawfully entitled to posses the following self-loading weapons:4\nBeretta 9 mm pistol\nBernadelli .22 pistol\nCZ OR50 .32 pistol\nKalashnikov 7.62 mm rifle\nUnderwood Carbine .30 rifle\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 provided, inter alia\n a prohibition on high powered self-loading rifles\n a prohibition on burst fire weapons and repeating short barrelled smooth bore guns\n that pump action and self-loading short guns with a magazine capacity in excess of 2 shots\nbe brought under the same control as rifles and pistols \n that prohibited weapons converted from a higher classification to a lower one, should retain\nthe original higher classification.\n that the onus was on the applicant for a certificate to show that he could be permitted to\npossess a shotgun without danger to the public safety or the peace and\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 1995-96; HC 393-II, p.110\n4 11.2.88 HC Deb 127 c.306W\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n the power for the chief officer to refuse to grant or renew a certificate if satisfied that the\napplicant did not have good reason for possessing a shotgun.\nThe Firearms Rules 1989, SI 1989/854 set out inter alia new requirements for the safekeeping\nof shotguns, as did the Firearms (Scotland) Rules in Scotland, SI 1989/889. S.22 of the Act\nestablished a firearms consultative committee to keep under review the working of the\nFirearms Acts.\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Act 1994 created new criminal offences of using a firearm or\nimitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and made it clear that the offence of\ntrespassing with a firearm can be committed when using an imitation firearm.\nThe controls in Northern Ireland imposed by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 are\ndescribed on p.77.\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nB. Controls on Firearms - Part I of the Bill\n1. General Principles, Definitions and Current Controls\nThe underlying purpose of firearms legislation in the UK is to control the supply and\npossession of all rifles, guns and pistols which could be used for criminal or subversive\npurposes while recognising that individuals may own and use firearms for legitimate purposes.\nThe possession of pistols, revolvers, rifles and ammunition for these weapons has required\na police firearm certificate since the implementation of the Firearms Act 1920 and shotguns\nhave required a police certificate since 1967. Machine guns have been prohibited wapons\nsince 1937. The principal Act in England and Wales and Scotland is the Firearms Act 1968,\nas amended by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 and others. \nFor the purposes of the Firearms Acts 1968-1992, \"firearm\" means \"a lethal barrelled weapon\nof any description from which any shot, bullet or missile can be discharged...\"5 The Firearms\nAct 1982 extended the definition of \"firearm\" to include some imitation firearms. \nControls of varying degrees are placed on four broad categories of weapons under the\nFirearms Acts. These categories are: \nProhibited Weapons\nSome types of weapon and ammunition are prohibited altogether and may only lawfully be\nheld in someone's possession, purchased, acquired, manufactured, sold or transferred with the\nauthority of the Secretary of State. The full list is set out in Section 5(1) of the Firearms Act\n1968 as follows:\n(a) any firearm which is so designed or adapted that two or more missiles\ncan be successively discharged without repeated pressure on the\ntrigger;\n(ab) any self-loading or pump-action rifle other than one which is\nchambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges;\n(ac) any self-loading or pump-action smooth-bore gun which is not\nchambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges and either has a barrel less than\n24 inches in length or (excluding any detachable, folding, retractable\nor other movable butt-stock) is less than 40 inches in length overall;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 Firearms Act 1968 Section 57 (i)\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n(ad) any smooth-bore revolver gun other than one which is chambered for\n9 mm rim-fire cartridges or loaded at the muzzle end of each chamber;\n(ae) any rocket launcher, or any mortar, for projecting a stabilised missile,\nother than a launcher or mortar designed for line-throwing or\npyrotechnic purposes or as signalling apparatus;\n(b) any weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the\ndischarge of any noxious liquid, gas or other thing; and\n[(c) any cartridge with a bullet designed to explode on or immediately\nbefore impact, any ammunition containing or designed or adapted to\ncontain any such noxious thing as is mentioned in paragraph (b) above\nand, if capable of being used with a firearm of any description, any\ngrenade, bomb (or other like missile), or rocket or shell designed to\nexplode as aforesaid].\nParagraphs a)-ae) and paragraph c) of this subsection were introduced by the Firearms\n(Amendment) Act 1988 in the wake of the massacre at Hungerford in the summer of 1987.\nUnder Section 5A of the 1968 Act the possession, purchase, acquisition, sale or transfer of\ncertain weapons is prohibited without the authority of the Secretary of State unless these\nactivities come within the terms of a certificate authorising such activities for the purpose of\nmaintaining, keeping or exhibiting the weapons as part of a collection. The weapons and\nammunition covered by this provision are as follows:\n(a) any firearm which is disguised as another object;\n(b) any rocket or ammunition not falling within paragraph (c) of\nsubsection (1)of this section which consists in or incorporates a missile\ndesigned to explode on or immediately before impact and is for\nmilitary use;\n(c) any launcher or other projecting apparatus not falling within paragraph\n(ae) of that subsection which is designed to be used with any rocket\nor ammunition falling within paragraph (b) above or with ammunition\nwhich would fall within that paragraph but for its being ammunition\nfalling with paragraph (c) of that subsection;\n(d) any ammunition for military use which consists in or incorporates a\nmissile designed so that a substance contained in the missile will ignite\non or immediately before impact;\n(e) any ammunition for military use which consists in or incorporates a\nmissile designed, on account of its having a jacket and hard-core, to\npenetrate armour plating, armour screening or body armour;\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n(f) any ammunition which is designed to be used with a pistol and\nincorporates a missile designed or adapted to expand on impact;\n(g) anything which is designed to be projected as a missile from any\nweapon and is designed to be, or has been, incorporated in\n(i) any ammunition falling within any of the preceding paragraphs; or\n(ii) any ammunition which would fall within any of those paragraphs\nbut for it being specified in subsection (1) of this section.\nWeapons not subject to controls.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, some types of weapon do not require a certificate at all.\nThese include air guns, other than those of a type which have been declared by rules made\nby the Secretary of State under Section 53 of the 1968 Act to be particularly dangerous. The\nsale or hire of air weapons to those under the age of 17 is, however prohibited under the\nFirearms Act 1968. Young people under the age of 14 may not buy, hire or be given or own\nan air weapon and may use one only if they are supervised by someone who is 21 or over.\nShotguns \nSection 1(3) of the 1968 Act as amended by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 defines a\n\"shotgun\" as follows:\n(a) a shot gun within the meaning of this Act, that is to say a smooth-\nbore gun (not being an air gun) which-\n(i) has a barrel not less than 24 inches in length and does not have\nany barrel with a bore exceeding 2 inches in diameter;\n(ii) either has no magazine or has a non-detachable magazine\nincapable of holding more than two cartridges; and\n(iii) is not a revolver gun\nUnder Section 2 of the 1968 Act it is an offence for a person to possess, purchase or acquire\nshotguns or ammunition for shotguns except within the terms of a shotgun certificate issued\nby the chief officer of police for the area in which the person resides.\nFirearms\nThese are lethal barrelled weapons of any description from which any shot, bullet or missile\ncan be discharged.\"6 other than those which come within the other three categories of weapon.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n6 Firearms Act 1968 Section 57 (i)\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nRifles, pistols, revolvers and other types of handguns are the principal weapons coming within\nthis category. Section 1 of the 1968 Act makes it an offence for a person to possess, purchase\nor acquire firearms or ammunition for firearms except within the terms of a firearm\ncertificate issued by the chief officer of police for the area in which the person resides.\n\"Handguns\"\nIn its report on the Possession of Handguns, published on July 24 1996 the Home Affairs\nCommittee noted that:7\nHandguns: a definition\n5. The word \"handgun\" is not a term used in legislation, but may be seen as a generic term\ncovering all smaller guns (generally pistols) designed to be fired from the hands rather than\nfrom the shoulder. Pistols may be:\n(i) automatic, in which case the weapon will fire continuously so long as ammunition\nis fed to it and pressure is applied to the trigger: we note that, contrary to\nwidespread belief, these weapons are already banned;\n(ii) semi-automatic, in which case separate trigger actions are required in order to fire\neach shot, but ammunition is fed to the chamber automatically from a magazine;\n(iii) revolvers, in which case ammunition is loaded into a revolving cylinder usually\ncontaining up to six rounds; or\n(iv) single-shot, in which case the pistol has to be reloaded manually for each shot.\nExemptions from the certification requirement\nThe Firearms Act 1968 provides exemptions from the need to hold a firearm or shotgun\ncertificate in some circumstances. These tend to exempt a person in particular circumstances\nin respect of firearms held, purchased or acquired for some particular and specified purpose.\nExemptions in these sorts of terms include those for:\ni) people who have obtained police permits (Section 7);\nii) authorised firearms dealers and people in business as carriers, auctioneers or\nwarehousemen for the possession of firearms or ammunition in the ordinary course of their\nbusinesses (Sections 8 and 9); \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n7 HC 393-I Session 1995-96 \n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\niii) people licensed to slaughter animals, for the possession of firearms in the\nslaughterhouses or knacker's yards in which they are employed, and the proprietors of such\nestablishments, or people appointed by them to take charge of slaughtering instruments, for\nthe purpose of keeping them in safe storage for the possession of firearms for that purpose\n(Section 10);\niv) firearms used in theatrical performances and film production, on board ships and aircraft,\nin certain specified circumstances (Sections 12 and 13);\nv) firearms used in sports, athletics and other approved activities, as provided by Section\n11 of the 1968 Act :\n(1) A person carrying a firearm or ammunition belonging to another\nperson holding a certificate under this Act may, without himself holding\nsuch a certificate, have in his possession that firearm or ammunition under\ninstructions from, and for the use of, that other person for sporting purposes\nonly.\n(2) A person may, without holding a certificate, have a firearm in his\npossession at an athletic meeting for the purpose of starting races at that\nmeeting.\n(3) A member of a ... cadet corps approved by the Secretary of State\nmay, without holding a certificate, have in his possession a firearm and\nammunition when engaged as a member of the ... corps in, or in connection\nwith, drill or target practice.\n(4) A person conducting or carrying on a miniature rifle range (whether\nfor a rifle club or otherwise) or shooting gallery at which no firearms are\nused other than air weapons or miniature rifles not exceeding .23 inch\ncalibre may, without holding a certificate, have in his possession, or\npurchase or acquire, such miniature rifles and ammunition suitable therefor;\nand any person may, without holding a certificate, use any such rifle and\nammunition at such a range or gallery.\n(5) A person may, without holding a shot gun certificate, borrow a shot\ngun from the occupier of private premises and use it on those premises in\nthe occupier's presence.\n(6) A person may, without holding a shot gun certificate, use a shot gun\nat a time and place approved for shooting at artificial targets by the chief\nofficer of police for the area in which that place is situated.\nSection 16 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 also provides that:\n16 Borrowed rifles on private premises\n(1) A person of or over the age of seventeen may, without holding a\nfirearm certificate, borrow a rifle from the occupier of private premises and\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nuse it on those premises in the presence either of the occupier or of a\nservant of the occupier if-\n(a) the occupier or servant in whose presence it is used holds a\nfirearm certificate in respect of that rifle; and\n(b) the borrower's possession and use of it complies with any\nconditions as to those matters specified in the certificate.\n(2) A person who by virtue of subsection (1) above is entitled without\nholding a firearm certificate to borrow and use a rifle in another person's\npresence may also, without holding such a certificate, purchase or acquire\nammunition for use in the rifle and have it in his possession during the\nperiod for which the rifle is borrowed if-\n(a) the firearm certificate held by that other person authorises the\nholder to have in his possession at that time ammunition for\nthe rifle of a quantity not less than that purchased or acquired\nby, and in the possession of, the borrower; and\n(b) the borrower's possession and use of the ammunition complies\nwith any conditions as to those matters specified in the\ncertificate.\n\"Private premises\" in these Sections of the 1968 and 1988 Acts includes land. Under Section\n7 of the Firearms Act 1968 a person may obtain a permit from the chief officer of police for\nthe area in which he resides which will enable him to possess a firearm and ammunition for\na specified purpose without holding a certificate under the 1968 Act. Section 17 of the\nFirearms (Amendment) Act 1988 also allows a visitor to Great Britain who has obtained a\nvisitors' permit from a chief officer of police in this country to possess a firearm and purchase\nor acquire ammunition, or possess a shotgun and purchase or acquire shotguns without the\nneed for a firearm or shotgun certificate.\nThe evidence submitted by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to\nLord Cullen's Inquiry into the shootings at Dunblane Primary School describes the uses of\nfirearms as follows:\n9. Aside from the police and military, firearms and shot guns have both occupational and\nleisure uses and there is a substantial shooting community in Great Britain. Shotguns are used\nfor game shooting, rough shooting, shooting artificial moving targets such as clay pigeons and\nby farmers and farm workers for shooting vermin.\n10. Use of rifles is generally confined to target shooting and deer stalking although one\nparticular type (.22 inch rimfire) has a long-established use in pest control on agricultural land.\nHandguns such as revolvers and pistols are generally only used for target shooting, either at\ntraditional bullseye targets or in 'practical shooting' which involves firing at multiple and\npossibly moving targets to time limits. But they too have occupational uses, for example\namong veterinary surgeons and others who may need to destroy seriously wounded animals\nquickly and humanely.\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n11. Most shooting  clubs have a firing range of their own or regular access to one, and\ncompetitive target shooting is a well established sport. It is generally organised under the\nauspices of one of the national shooting organisations, in particular the National Rifle\nAssociation, National Small-bore Rifle Association and National Pistol Association.\n12. The ranges at Bisley, Surrey, recognised by the Sports Council as the national shooting\ncentre, have occupied a prominent place in the shooting sports, both at home and abroad, for\nmany years. A number of target shooting disciplines are recognised Olympic events and\nBritish marksmen have distinguished themselves internationally over the years.\n2. Proposals to Restrict the Availability of Firearms\nFollowing the massacre at Dunblane Primary School on March 21 1996 the Government set\nup a Tribunal of Inquiry under Lord Cullen to inquire into the circumstances leading up to\nand surrounding the events at Dunblane, to consider the issues arising from those events, to\nmake interim and final recommendations and to report as soon as practicable. The report of\nThe Public Inquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 19968 was\nduly published on October 16 1996. In his report, Lord Cullen recommended that:9\n24. Consideration should be given to restricting the availability of self-\nloading pistols and revolvers of any calibre which are held by individuals for\nuse in target shooting\npreferably, by their disablement, while they are not in use, by either\n(i) the removal of the slide assembly/cylinder, which is to be kept\nsecurely on the premises of an approved club of which the owner is\na member or by a club official; or (ii) the fitting of a locked barrel\nblock by a club official (para 9.112);\nor, if such a system is not adopted, by the banning of the possession of such\nhandguns by individual owners (para 9.113).\nLord Cullen set out the rationale behind this approach in Chapter 9 of his report. He noted\nthe \"entrenched attitude\" of the shooting community's representatives at the Inquiry, who\nwere, he said, \" opposed in principle to any restriction on the availability of handguns.\"10 Lord\nCullen also referred to the role of Government and Parliament in deciding questions of policy\nin relation to the availability of handguns and other firearms:11\n9.111 At the same time l am very conscious that proposals such as a ban on\nthe possession of a certain type of firearm raise questions which are\npeculiarly within the province of the Government and Parliament to decide.\nThus after the shootings at Hungerford in August 1987. the Government\ndecided how far there should be, in \"the words of the White Paper, a shift\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 Cm 3386\n9 ibid. p150\n10 ibid para 9.110\n11 ibid para 9.111\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nin the balance of controls 'between safeguarding the public at large and\nprotecting, the interests of the legitimate shooting community\" (Firearms Act\n1968: Proposals for Reform, para 4.) Michael Ryan had killed half of his\nvictims with shots from a self-loading pistol and the fact that handguns\nposed particular dangers was recognised (Green Book Part 11, para 11).\nHowever, the Government did not propose that handguns should be banned.\nThe proposal of such a ban after the shootings at Dunblane once more raises\na question of policy. It is necessary to decide what risk is acceptable,\nbearing in mind that some risk is an inevitable feature of daily life. Against\nthe risk to society has to be balanced the loss of freedom of the individual\nand the other implications which I mentioned earlier (paras 9.100-9.105).\nThere may also be competing claims on the use of resources. In the light\nof these points it is clear to me that in stating my own conclusions I should\nconfine myself to what I recommend should be considered.\nLord Cullen said that if for any reason the course he recommended was not followed he saw\nno alternative to considering the \"more draconian alternative\" of a ban on multi-shot\nhandguns. He added that:12\nHowever. in such circumstances I would suggest that the ban should be\ndirected to the possession of such handguns by individual owners rather than\nthe possession of handguns by shooting clubs, since it is through possession\nby individuals that the risk, in so far as there is a risk, of homicide or\nserious injury arises. Thus I do not consider that the banning of handguns\nfor target shooting or the banning of shooting clubs would be justified. I\nhave no particular recommendation as to the legislative means by which\neffect would be given to such a ban.\nLord Cullen set out the arguments which had been presented to him concerning a total ban\non guns and his view of those arguments as follows:13\n7.12 At this point I turn to consider the submission made by Mr C M\nCampbell QC who represented the families of the deceased children, the\ninjured children, the children who were absent from class and Mrs Harrild\nand Mrs Blake. I take this submission first since it would have as its logical\nconsequence the ending of the certification system for any category of\nfirearm. It follows therefore that I should deal with it before going further\ninto the questions which I have posed in the last two paragraphs.\n7.13 Mr Campbell emphasised at the outset that Thomas Hamilton's actions\nhad thrown into relief the dangers to society of there being many people\narmed with \"weapons designed to kill\" and able to accomplish this with\nrapid and clinical efficiency. The time had come for radical change. There\nshould be \"a complete ban on the civilian ownership, possession and use of\nall types of gun\". In support of that submission he put forward the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12 ibid para 9.113 \n13 Cm 3386 p.81-83\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nfollowing. First, even with the most thorough safeguards, the potential for\nanother Dunblane would remain. Mistakes would occur. Second, there was\nalways a conflict or tension between limited resources on the one hand and\nthe need for a rigorous system of control on the other. Third, there was a\ntension between a police force seeking to regulate the shooting community\nand a police force which was under pressure to provide a good service to the\nsame people. It could not be ensured that public safety would always be the\nparamount consideration. Fourth, there was always a potential for an\nindividual's circumstances to change in such a way that danger arose where\nnone existed before. The current firearms laws were not designed to cope\nwith the present relatively large number of urban residents who possessed\nsemiautomatic handguns for no reason other than target shooting. Fifth, the\ncurrent system and the existence of shooting clubs would continue to\nintroduce many thousands of people to guns over the years people who\notherwise would not be familiar with them. Not all of them were of\nimpeccable character. Some were attracted by the guns themselves, their\nsupposed glamour and their boost to the ego. Sixth, there was, he said, an\napparently well-established link between access to guns and the rate of gun-\ncrimes and gun-suicides.\n7.14 Mr Campbell added that the debate should not be influenced by any\nsupposed inherent right to hold guns. A safety-first philosophy should be\nadopted and this pointed to radical change. Any decision to continue to\npermit lawful possession of firearms necessarily implied a willingness to\ntolerate an increased rate of gun-crime and gun-suicide. It might be thought\nthat the shooting community \"do themselves few favours by their apparent\nreluctance to countenance any material change\".\n7.15 The BSSC in their final written submission pointed out that no\nwitness at the Inquiry. with the exception of Mr McMurdo, the former\nDeputy Chief Constable of Central Scotland Police, suggested such a\nprohibition. They pointed out that the Dunblane Snowdrop Petition stopped\nshort of such a call. in submitting that all firearms held for recreational\npurposes for use in authorised sporting clubs should be held securely at such\nclubs with the firm, mechanisms removed. and that the private ownership of\nhandguns be made illegal. The BSSC maintained that there was no\nconvincing evidence that if Thomas Hamilton had been denied lawful access\nto firearms. he would not have found and used some other means to carry\nout his premeditated plans, or been able in a relatively short space of time\nto acquire a firearm and ammunition from the \"vast stock of illegally-held\nguns in circulation\". They drew attention to the statement in the Green\nBook (Part II. paras 4 and 6) that such a prohibition would be unprecedented\nin a democratic country and would have very serious consequences.\nincluding adverse economic impact. Mr Mark Scoggins, who appeared for\nthe BSSC during closing submissions. observed that even if a tension existed\nbetween a duty to regulate and a pressure to provide a service it was not in\nany way unique to target shooting. He instanced to position of other\nregulators such as the Health and Safety Executive. The general function\nof the police was to provide a service to the community. Even if there was\na potential conflict or tension, the solution was to combine firmness with\nfairness. It was not correct to depict firearms laws as out of joint with the\nscale of firearm-ownership in modern times. Evidence had been given as\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nto the large number of guns in private ownership before the first legislation\nin 1920. The assertion that the shooting community had done itself few\nfavours overlooked the fact that their position was that \"at the centre is the\nindividual not guns\". In that respect they had made a number of proposals.\nSound reasons had been given for not adopting various means of control\nover guns which had been suggested. Mr C N McEachran QC who\nappeared for the Scottish Target Shooting Federation drew my attention to\nsubmissions which had challenged the assertion that there was a link\nbetween the availability of guns and the rate of gun-crime.\n7.16 The submission made by Mr Campbell is of such width that it would\nembrace not merely handguns. with which the Inquiry was directly\nconcerned. but also rifles, shot guns and air weapons: and would admit of\nno exceptions. It would prevent the use of guns for occupational purposes\nsuch as shot guns used for shooting game and vermin, rifles for deer\nstocking and pest control: and handguns for humane disposal of seriously\ninjured animals, slaughtering of animals and signalling the start of races at\nathletic meetings. No doubt it would be possible to devise a system of\nexceptions which could be grafted on to a wholesale prohibition.\nHowever, the more fundamental point is that the range of uses for these\ntypes of guns is very different. Thus the considerations relating to the\npossession and use of shotguns are concerned with very different areas of\nactivity from those relating to handguns. I am not persuaded that it is\njustifiable to approach all these types in essentially the same manner. That\nis quite apart from the fact that I do not consider that the availability of shot\nguns is a matter which has a tenable connection with the circumstances with\nwhich this Inquiry is concerned.\n7.17 For these reasons I do not recommend that such a wholesale prohibition\nshould be considered. However, that is not to say that I will not have to\nlook at the case for restricting, the availability of certain firearms with which\nthe Inquiry is concerned. In doing so I will have to take account of\narguments which I have summarised above, as well as many more besides.\nHe also made the following remarks about the banning of the possession by individuals of\nmulti-shot handguns:14\n9.95 This is the course of action which is advocated by ACOPS in the\nform of a recommendation that \"all multi-shot pistols be raised to the\nprohibited category\" , ie so that they would fall within section 5 of the 1968\nAct. However, as Chief Constable Cameron explained in evidence, ACOPS\nenvisaged that the Secretary of State would authorise such handguns to be\npossessed by shooting clubs where they would be stored. Both ACOPS and\nACPO recommend that the handguns in respect of which firearm certificates\nmay be granted for target shooting should be restricted to a single shot and\nto .22 calibre. The Police Federation of England and Wales advocate that\nthe private possession of all handguns should be banned. It may be noted\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 Cm 3386 p.126-127\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthat the position of ACPO has changed since the hearing before the Home\nAffairs Committee on 8 May. At that time their position was that a\nprohibition on the licensed possession of handguns was impracticable.\nGiven ACPO's views to the Committee Mr Sharples acknowledged that\nGreat Britain featured in national/international, European and Olympic\nevents and that the use of handguns in connection with that sporting interest\nwas extensive. A complete ban of handguns would cause significant\ndifficulties for a very substantial law-abiding element in the country who\npursued quite proper sporting activities (Q19).\n9.96 The practicability of such a measure was not questioned save in one\nrespect. It was suggested that the EC Weapons Directive (91/447/EEC)\nwould prevent the implementation of such a ban. This Directive provided\nfor the partial harmonisation of Member States' domestic firearms controls\nin order to reach consistency in regard to minimum standards. However, it\nallows Member States to maintain or introduce domestic controls which are\nmore stringent than those standards. provided that the European Commission\nand other Member States are advised accordingly. Thus, as I understand the\nposition, the Directive does not prevent this country from introducing such\na ban. The Directive is due to be reviewed by the European Commission\nby the end of 1997. This will provide an opportunity for the Government\nto put its case for altering any of the prohibitions which apply to all Member\nStates if it sees a case for so doing.\n9.97 As I have already indicated in the first part of the chapter it was\nquestioned whether any restriction on the legal availability of firearms would\nbe effective. It was suggested that the owners of handguns which were\ncurrently in lawful possession might avoid confiscation by causing them to\n\"disappear\". Examples of this phenomenon were drawn by some\ncommentators from the past history of firearms control in this country and\nin Germany. Even if the withdrawal of lawfully held handguns was\nachieved, professional criminals and others who were bent on mischief could\nobtain illegal handguns. Further there was a risk that by process of\n\"displacement\" they might resort to the use of other types of firearm, such\nas shot guns, which were capable of delivering shots which were more\ndevastating, or to other methods of destruction such as bombs. There was\nnothing to suggest that the banning of self-loading rifles under the 1988 Act\n(which had led to the confiscation of Thomas Hamilton's rifle) had prevented\nthe happening of anything that was worse than occurred. The same points\nalso apply to the proposal that the handguns in respect of which firearm\ncertificates may be granted for target shooting should be restricted to .22\ncalibre.\n9.98 None of these points can be dismissed from consideration. However\ngiven that lawfully held handguns are identified in firearm certificates, the\nopportunity for them to \"disappear\" is much less than if they were not\nidentified at all. I have already rejected the contention that legally held\nfirearms are of no significance in regard to the commission of crime, and\nexpressed the view that the arguments in support of weapon substitution are\noverstated. I am not convinced that a restriction on the availability of\nhandguns would actually lead to an increase in injury. I am satisfied that\na ban on the possession of multi-shot handguns would have some effect on\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthe incidence of serious crime.\nIn its response to Lord Cullen's Report the Government said it intended to go further than\nLord Cullen had suggested and prohibit all higher calibre handguns. It also proposed to\nprohibit people from keeping even single shot handguns at home:15\nAs recommended by Lord Cullen the Government has considered restricting\nthe availability of self-loading hand guns. It has given careful consideration\nto Lord Cullen's suggestions, which fall into two parts. It has concluded that\nneither would provide an acceptable level of public safety. \nFirst of all he has suggested two methods by which hand guns might be\ndisabled. The first involves the removal of key components from the gun.\nWhile removal of key components is feasible for certain types of guns, it is\nnot a practical proposition for others. Alternatively, Lord Cullen has\nindicated that weapons might be disabled by fitting a locked \"barrel block\"\nto the gun. He recognised however that such devices are currently\nmanufactured only for shot guns. Even if they were available, the Forensic\nScience Service-which advises the Government on the technical aspects of\nfirearms including their deactivation-is not convinced that a barrel block or\nsimilar device could not be removed by a determined individual and the\nGovernment does not, therefore, believe that it could rely on such a measure.\nLord Cullen's second suggestion is that if guns cannot be disabled,\nconsideration should be given to banning the possession of self-loading\npistols and revolvers by individuals. In the light of this the Government has\ndecided to legislate early in the next session of Parliament to ban all hand\nguns of more than .22 calibre including those used by Thomas Hamilton.\nThis will mean that at least 160,000 guns-80% of those legally held at\npresent-will be destroyed. All hand guns chambered for .22 rimfire\nammunition, including single shot guns, will also be banned unless they are\nkept in licensed gun clubs under conditions of the most stringent security.\nThis means that, in two important respects, the Government intends to go\nfurther than Lord Cullen's proposals: by banning all higher calibre handguns;\nand by prohibiting people from keeping even single shot handguns at home.\nIn his statement to the House on the day the Cullen report and the Government's response to\nit were published the Home Secretary, Michael Howard, set out the Government's legislative\nintentions in relation to handguns as follows:16\nI come to the question that I know will be of\ngreatest concern to the House and the nation: the\ncontrols on the ownership of handguns. Lord\nCullen confines his suggestions to self-loading\npistols and revolvers of all calibres. He does not\nconsider that further restrictions are required for\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n15 The Public Inquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996 - The Government Response.\nCm 3392 p5\n16 HC Deb Vol 282 c832-833 16.10.1996\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nsingle-shot handguns, which he would allow to be\nkept in the home, as at present. He suggests that\nowners of multi-shot guns should be required to\ndisable them when keeping them at home, and goes\non to say that, if after consideration those\narrangements are found not to be practicable, there\nshould instead be a ban on the possession of multi-\nshot handguns by individual owners. He envisages\nthat it would still be possible for guns to be kept by\na club secretary so that target shooting could\ncontinue, using guns owned by the club.\nThe Government have taken advice from the\nForensic Science Service on the practicability of\nLord Cullen's suggestions for disabling handguns.\nLord Cullen himself recognised that there were\nconsiderable practical difficulties in removing key\ncomponents from handguns. The Forensic Science\nService has confirmed that view. It is also not\nconvinced that a barrel block-Lord Cullen's other\nsuggestion-could be made that someone with\nsufficient determination and access to metal-\nworking tools could not remove. As a result, I\nhave come to the conclusion that we cannot\nrecommend that approach to the House.\nI therefore come to Lord Cullen's alternative\nsuggestion of banning multi-shot handguns from\nindividual ownership. I propose to go considerably\nfurther than Lord Cullen has suggested in two\nrespects. First, we shall ban all handguns from\npeople's homes. I do not agree with Lord Cullen\nthat it would be safe to allow single-shot handguns\nto remain in the home. I believe that they should\nbe subject to the same controls as those imposed on\nmulti-shot handguns.\nSecondly, we shall outlaw high-calibre\nhandguns of the kind used by Thomas Hamilton.\nLow-calibre handguns-.22 rimfire handguns-will\nhave to be used and kept in licensed clubs. We\nbelieve that a distinction needs to be made between\nhigh-calibre handguns, which are principally made\nfor police and military use, and .22 rimfire\nhandguns, which are largely intended for target\nshooting. Although Lord Cullen decided against\nmaking such a distinction, he sets out in paragraph\n9.49 of his report a table that demonstrates that a\n.22 handgun is some four to six times less powerful\nthan higher-calibre handguns.\nIn paragraph 9.44, Lord Cullen points out that\nthe expansion in the use of high-calibre handguns\nhas even made many shooters concerned about the\nuse of such guns symbols of personal power. In\naddition, target shooting with .22 handguns has\nbeen an Olympic sport since 1896. There will be\nexceptions for the very few professionals, such as\nvets, who need handguns outside gun clubs for the\nhumane destruction of animals.\nThe proposals will mean that at least 160,000\nhandguns-80 per cent. of those legally held at.\npresent will be destroyed. Appropriate\ncompensation will be paid.\nIn setting out the Labour Party's response to these proposals Jack Straw said that:17\nAs we heard from the Secretary of State for\nScotland, Thomas Hamilton -one man-killed 16\nchildren and one teacher, and injured 17 others, by\ndischarging 105 rounds of ammunition from a\nsingle semi-automatic handgun in the space of three\nminutes. Handguns are small, portable, easy to\nhide and lethal. In the light of Lord Cullen's\nreport-and especially his analysis-it is our\nconsidered judgment that handguns should be\nbanned altogether from general civilian use.\nMay I make it clear to the Secretary of State\nthat we shall of course co-operate fully to ensure\nthat legislation is passed speedily through\nParliament, to implement the will of this House and\nthe other place for a root-and-branch reform of gun\nlaw? We welcome almost everything in the\nSecretary of State's statement, and especially the\ncomplete ban on all handguns from people's homes.\nBut, with respect, we do not believe that his\nproposals go far enough. Let me briefly give our\nreasons.\nIn the evidence submitted to the Cullen inquiry\non behalf of the Labour party by my hon. Friend\nthe Member for Hamilton and me, we said that\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n17 HC Deb Vol 282 c834-835 16.10.1996\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthere was a strong case for banning all handguns,\napart from some very limited occupational\nexceptions such as vets and casualty slaughterers.\nWe then said that it was for the shooting fraternity\nto make a case for exceptions to that-for example,\nin respect of single-shot .22 pistols. But, in our\njudgment, the shooting fraternity has failed to do\nso.\nLord Cullen says that an exemption for single-\nshot .22 handguns would be both impractical and\nineffective because they could easily be reconverted\nto multi-shot guns, and we accept that view. Partial\nbans, moreover, would create extra work for the\npolice. As the Police Federation said in its\nevidence to Lord Cullen, .22 weapons may be just\nas lethal as higher-calibre weapons.\nIn reply to this the Home Secretary made the following comments about proposals for a\ncomplete prohibition on the ownership and possession of handguns:18\nMr. Howard: I am grateful to the hon.\nGentleman for the remarks with which he began his\nobservations. He identified with some precision the\ndifference that lies between us. We believe that it\nis possible to give the public the protection that\nthey rightly require and deserve without going so\nfar as to put in place a complete prohibition on the\nownership and possession of handguns for which\nthe hon. Gentleman called. We believe that if it is\npossible to provide that protection without a\ncomplete ban, it is the Government's duty to take\nthat course.\nI ask the hon. Gentleman and those sitting\nbehind him to reflect on the unhappy history of the\ncomplete prohibition of activities hitherto regarded\nas lawful. It would not be in anyone's interests,\nleast of all the protection of the public, to drive\nunderground an activity that could then be\nconducted without any safeguards for security,\nwhereas if it remains possible to carry out that\nactivity legitimately, under extremely secure\nsafeguards, the public's protection might be greater.\nI ask him to reflect on that.\nSpeaking for the Liberal Democrats Alan Beith said:19\nMr. A. J. Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed): Does\nthe Home Secretary accept the following\nproposition, the importance of which was\nunderlined by the slaughter at Dunblane? In this\ncountry, we regard the possession of guns not as a\nright, but as a privilege that has to be carefully\ncontrolled and safeguarded to protect public safety\nand public confidence. As the Government's\nproposals have much common ground with our\nproposals to the Cullen inquiry, will the Home\nSecretary note that we are prepared to support and\nfacilitate legislation based on those proposals, as\nlong as the House has an opportunity to consider\non a free vote whether a ban on 80 per cent. of\nhandguns is adequate and workable or whether it is\nnecessary to go further?\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n18 HC Deb Vol 282 c835-836 16.10.1996\n19 HC Deb Vol 282 c836-837 \n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nUnder the Government's proposals, who would be\nallowed to transport guns between one gun club\nand another or from a gun club to a competition?\nDoes the Home Secretary agree that it would be\nwrong to pretend that either the proposals or a total\nban provided any guarantee against the misuse of\nguns leading to a slaughter such as that at\nDunblane, so vigilance and effective and well-\nresourced policing remain essential?\nThe Home Secretary replied that:20\nMr. Howard: I agree with the right hon.\nGentleman's first proposition, that there is no right\nto hold a gun under our laws and that it is a\nprivilege. I agree with that approach and I note\nwhat he said about his party's approach to the\nlegislation.\nOn the transportation of guns from one club to\nanother under the proposed arrangements, we intend\nto have consultations with chief constables and\nothers about the details but, as I said in my\nstatement, we envisage that it should be permitted\nonly in the most limited circumstances and under\nthe most stringent controls. For example, the\ntransportation should be effected not by the owner\nof the gun, but by a third party specifically\nauthorised for that purpose.\nI entirely agree with what the right hon.\nGentleman said about illegally held weapons and\nabout the need for continued vigilance to deal with\nthat very considerable problem.\nSome commentators have criticised the Government for not proposing a complete prohibition\non handguns, citing the view of the Police Federation, in its evidence to Lord Cullen, that .22\ncalibre firearms may be as lethal as higher-calibre weapons. Press reports claimed that\nweapons of this calibre had been used in the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Yitzhak\nRabin, and in the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley Jr. Some\ncommentators have also called for a general prohibition on shotguns, noting, as Lord Cullen\ndid,21 that an individual shot from a handgun, depending on the distance and calibre, may be\nless lethal than a shot from a shotgun or rifle. In its report on The Possession of Handguns\nthe Home Affairs Committee noted that:22\n6. The Home Office, in evidence to Lord Cullen's inquiry which was prepared jointly with\nthe Scottish Office, and which was also submitted to this inquiry, maintained that handguns,\nbeing small, easily concealed and carried, and capable of rapidly firing a large number of\nrounds without reloading, were weapons of a \"particularly dangerous nature\". This view is\nnot universally held;' it may be argued that a shot from a standard rifle will generate more\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n20 HC Deb Vol 282 c837 16.10.1996\n21 Cm 3386 para 9.59\n22 HC 393-I Session 1995-96\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nenergy than will a shot from a typical self-loading handgun; a shotgun is likely to have a\ngreater destructive capacity even at close range, due to the spread of the shot.\nLord Cullen also referred in his report to the dangers posed by the use of air weapons at large\nand whether they should be subject to certification and unavailable until a later age than at\npresent. During the debate which followed the Home Secretary's statement on the Cullen\nreport the Home Secretary made the following remarks in reply to questions from Chris\nMullin about the dangers posed by shotguns and air weapons:23\nMr. Chris Mullin (Sunderland, South): I thank\nthe Home Secretary for endorsing the main plank\nof the minority report from the Home Affairs\nCommittee on the issue. It is not every day that a\nminority report is endorsed so swiftly by the Home\nOffice. I have one or two others that he might like\nto reconsider.\nDid the Home Secretary hear the comments this\nmorning by Mr. Michael Yardley, a firearms expert,\nthat it was pointless to ban handguns if something\nwas not also done about shotguns? Is it not about\ntime that we made a start on collecting some of the\n2 million shotguns in circulation, starting in urban\nareas? Everyone acknowledges that farmers need\nshotguns, for reasons that we all know about, but it\nis hard to understand why licences should be\ngranted to shotgun owners in urban areas.\nDoes the Home Secretary have any plans to do\nanything about the misuse of air weapons, which,\nas many of our colleagues will know, are\nresponsible for a great deal of mayhem in urban\nareas?\nMr. Howard: I note the hon. Gentleman's\nopening remarks. I am sure that he does not expect\nme to give any undertaking on my reaction to\nminority reports from the Home Affairs Committee\nin future. I do not follow the hon. Gentleman in\nhis observations about shotguns. Shotguns have\nmany wider applications than do handguns, which\nare restricted to target shooting. I do not think that\nthe hon. Gentleman has made a case for the\nrestriction on shotguns to which he has referred.\nSimilar observations apply to air rifles.\nThe Home Affairs Committee's report on The Possession of Handguns,24 the report of Lord\nCullen's Inquiry into the shootings at Dunblane25and the evidence submitted to Lord Cullen's\nInquiry on behalf of the Secretary for Scotland and the Home Secretary all contain views on\nthe possible effects of total or partial prohibitions of various types of guns or of all guns.\nConservative members of the Home Affairs Committee voted against recommendations that\nthe possession of handguns be banned and a number of other proposals concerning shotguns\nand airguns. The Committee's report, which caused much controversy, went on reach the\nfollowing conclusions on the subject of banning various categories of firearm:26\nBanning the possession of all guns\n5. We conclude that a ban on the possession of all guns would be too far-reaching.\n(para 50)\n6. We believe that a ban upon all guns would not prevent unstable individuals from\ngaining access to guns illegally, and we therefore reject this option. (para 51)\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n23 HC Deb Vol 282 c837-838 16.10.1996\n24 HC 393-I Session 1995-96 p.xvi-xxiv\n25 Cm 3386 paras 7.12-7.17 & 9.63-9.113\n26 HC 393-I Session 1995-96 pxxxiv\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n7. We believe that the opportunity should also be taken to review the restrictions\nupon possession of guns by young people, with regard to public safety. (para 52)\nBanning the possession of handguns\n8. We see no point in a total ban on the possession of handguns alone, and we do not\nrecommend it. (para 59)\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nPartial bans on the possession of handguns\n9. We doubt that a ban upon either the possession of handguns of above a certain\ncalibre, or on the possession of multi-shot handguns, would make a mass killing\nany less likely. We therefore reject these options. (para 63)\n10. Although we see some value in the proposal that handguns should be centrally\nstored, we do not believe that a determined criminal would be prevented from\nusing a weapon for criminal purposes; we therefore reject this suggestion. (para 69)\n11. We do not favour the proposal for possession of assembled handguns to be banned\nother than at licensed premises. (para 70)\n12. Although we see [a ban on possession of a handgun with ammunition] as a\npotentially attractive solution, we have concluded that there are significant\npractical difficulties which cannot be easily overcome, and we therefore reject it.\n(para 72)\n13. We reject the proposal for restrictions to be placed upon the number of handguns\nthat an individual might hold. (para 73)\nIn its report the Home Affairs Committee said it believed that the problems posed by illegally\nheld firearms were on a far larger scale than those posed by legally held firearms.27 It also\nnoted that policy on firearms control appeared to be formed without the benefit of statistical\nmaterial on the proportion of crime committed with stolen or borrowed legally-held weapons\nand recommended that records be kept of the sources of firearms recovered after crime.28 Lord\nCullen noted that while the statistical evidence available to him and to which he had referred\nwas of limited value it did show that while illegal firearms were used in the great majority\nof firearm-related crimes, and especially robberies, the existence of legally held firearms led\nto their use in crime in a significant, though relatively small number of cases. (Chapter 9 of\nLord Cullen's report and paragraphs 33-36 of the Home Affairs Committee's report discuss\nthe evidence and arguments on this subject in some detail.) In his statement on the changes\nproposed by the Government in response to Lord Cullen's report the Home Secretary\nobserved that:29 \nAmong all the words that have been written since that dreadful event at\nDunblane, there is one irrefutable fact, The crimes that were committed on\n13 March were committed with a gun that was legally bought and legally\npossessed. Those facts place an extremely onerous duty on the Government\nto consider what controls there should be on the ownership and possession\nof guns.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n27 ibid para 36\n28 ibid. para 35\n29 HC Deb Vol 282 c831 16.10.1996\n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n3. New Restrictions on Firearms - Part I of the Firearms (Amendment) Bill\n \nClause 1 of the Firearms (Amendment) Bill is intended to prohibit all handguns other than\nsmall-calibre pistols and signalling apparatus by adding the following firearms to the list of\nprohibited weapons set out in Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968:\n\"(aba) any firearm which either has a barrel less than 30 centimetres in\nlength or is less than 60 centimetres in length overall, other than an air\nweapon to which section I of this Act does not apply, a small-calibre\npistol or a firearm designed as signalling apparatus;\".\nThe possession, purchase, acquisition, manufacture, sale or transfer of these weapons without\nthe authority of the Secretary of State will be an offence punishable on summary conviction\nby up to six months' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine and on indictment by up to ten years'\nimprisonment30 and a fine.\nClauses 2,3,4 and 5 of the Bill are intended to provide exemptions from the need for\nauthorisation from the Secretary of State in respect of a handgun prohibited by virtue of\nClause 1 in four sets of circumstances. These are:\ni) Slaughtering Instruments, where the person possessing, purchasing, acquiring, selling\nor transferring the instrument is authorised by a firearm certificate to have in his possession,\npurchase or acquire such an instrument, or where he has it in his possession and is entitled\nto do so without a firearm certificate under Section 10 of the Firearms Act 1968. (Section 10\nof the 1968 Act permits licensed animal slaughterers and others to have slaughtering\ninstruments in their possession in certain circumstances - see p.12 above)\nii) Firearms used for the humane killing of animals, where the person is authorised under\na firearm certificate to have in his possession, purchase, acquire, sell or transfer a firearm\nsubject to a condition that it is only for use in connection with the humane killing of animals;\niii) Firearms used in connection with starting races at athletic meetings, where a person is\nauthorised under a firearm certificate to have in his possession, purchase or acquire a firearm\nsubject to a condition that it is only for use in connection with starting races at athletic\nmeetings, or where the person has it in his possession for that purpose at an athletic meeting.\niv) Trophies of war, where a person has in his possession a firearm which is a trophy of\nwar acquired by him before 1 January 1946 and has a firearm certificate authorising him to\ndo so. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n30 Firearms Act 1968 Schedule 6 as amended by Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 Schedule 8\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nSection 19 of the Firearms Act 1968 Act makes it an offence for a person to have a loaded\nshotgun or air weapon, or any other loaded or unloaded firearm, together with ammunition\nsuitable for use in that firearm, with him in a public place, without lawful authority or\nreasonable excuse (the proof of which lies on him, rather than the prosecution). Halsbury's\nStatutes notes that \"with him in a public place\" is thought to mean \"knowingly has with him\nin any public place\"31\nClause 6 will insert a new Section 19A in the Firearms Act 1968, designed to make it an\noffence for \"any person to have a small-calibre pistol [that is, a pistol chambered for .22 or\nsmaller rim-fire cartridges]32 with him outside licensed premises of a licensed pistol club\".\nOn the basis of the case-law referred to in Halsbury's Statutes it would seem likely that \"with\nhim\" here will be taken to mean \"knowingly with him\" The offence will be punishable on\nsummary conviction by up to six months' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine, and on conviction\non indictment by up to ten years' imprisonment and a fine. It will not be an offence for a\nperson to have such a weapon with him if he is permitted under the Act to have the pistol\nin his possession without holding a firearm certificate, if he is authorised to have the pistol\nin his possession under a firearm certificate which is not subject to a condition requiring it\nto be kept at a licensed pistol club, or if he is authorised to do so by virtue of a police permit\nunder Clause 8 of the Bill.\nClause 7 of the Bill is intended to ensure that, where a person applies for a firearm certificate\nfor a small-calibre pistol and the chief officer of police is satisfied that the applicant's only\nreason for having the pistol in his possession is to use it for target shooting, any certificate\ngranted to the applicant should be held subject to at least the following conditions:\na) the pistol is only to be used for target shooting;\nb) the holder must be a member of a licensed pistol club specified in the certificate;\nc) the pistol must be kept and used only at specified licensed premises of that club.\nAn existing firearm certificate relating to a small-calibre pistol, which is subject to the\ncondition that the pistol is only to be used on an approved range, will, after the\nimplementation of the provisions in the Bill, be treated as being held subject to the new\nconditions set out in Clause 7.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n31 Halsbury's Statutes Fourth Edition Volume 12 p450 citing R v Cugullere [1961] 2 All ER 343\n32 defined in an amendment to Section 57 of the 1968 Act which is to be inserted by Clause 1(6) of the Bill\n29\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nA person who fails to comply with these conditions and thereby commits an offence under\nSection 1(2) of the Firearms Act 1968 is to be treated, for the purposes of sentencing, as\nhaving committed that offence in an aggravated form. At present this offence is a summary\noffence punishable by up to six months' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine. Under amendments\nset out in paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 of the Bill the aggravated form will also be punishable\nfollowing conviction on indictment by up to seven years' imprisonment and a fine. \nClause 8 is intended to enable chief officers of police to issue permits authorising small-\ncalibre pistols to be taken outside licensed club premises for any \"proper purpose\" Clause 8(3)\ngoes on to say that:\n(3) A proper purpose for having a small-calibre pistol outside the licensed\npremises of a licensed pistol club may be any of the following, namely-\n(a) having the pistol repaired or maintained by a registered firearms\ndealer;\n(b) conveying the pistol from a police station at which it has been\nkept to a licensed pistol club or from one such club to another;\n(c) enabling the pistol to be used at a recognised target shooting\ncompetition;\n(d) selling or otherwise disposing of the pistol; or\n(e) any other purpose which appears to the chief officer of police to\nbe proper in all the circumstances.\nChief officers will be able to attach conditions to these permits in the interest of safety. It will\nbe an offence punishable on summary conviction by up to six months' imprisonment and a\n£5,000 fine for a person to fail to comply with such a condition or \"knowingly or recklessly\"\nto make a false statement for the purpose of procuring a permit for himself or another under\nthis provision.\nClause 9 and Schedule 1 of the Bill set out transitional arrangements intended to enable\nholders of small-calibre pistols to hand them to the police until such time as they can become\nmembers of licensed pistol clubs. They will be required to become members of such clubs\nwithin a transitional period of a year from the implementation of the relevant provisions of\nthe Bill, or a longer period, if this is specified in an order made by the Secretary of State\nusing the negative procedure. Small-calibre pistols handed in under these provisions will be\nretrievable provided that the police are given written notice at least four weeks before the end\nof the transitional period. If they are not retrieved within the transitional period they will be\ntreated as having been surrendered to the police. It will be an offence punishable on summary\nconviction by up to six months' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine for a person knowingly or\nrecklessly to make a false statement for the purpose of procuring the release of a pistol from\npolice custody, whether it is for himself or for another person.\n30\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nC. Firearm and Shotgun Certification Procedures\n1. Current Arrangements\nThe procedure governing the grant, renewal, variation and revocation of firearm and shotgun\ncertificates is set out in Sections 26-32 of the Firearms Act 1968. A Home Office publication\nFirearms Law: Guidance to the Police, which was published in 1989, explains the provisions\nof the 1968 Act as amended by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 and others and gives\nguidance to the police on how they should exercise their discretion in respect of the grant,\nvariation and revocation of firearm and shotgun certificates and other matters.\nThe current certification procedures are summarised in the evidence submitted on behalf of\nthe Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to Lord Cullen's Inquiry as\nfollows:33\n27. The two main levels of control are the shot gun certificate and firearm certificate\n(sections 1 and 2 of the 19 68 Act) . Like a firearm certificate, a shot gun certificate is issued\nby the chief officer of police. But the licensing regime it imposes is different from, and less\nstringent than, that imposed by the firearm certificate.\n28. Firearm and shot gun certificates both bear four standard, statutory conditions - These\nrequire the holder to sign the certificate, to inform the police of thefts and losses and of any\nchange of address, and to keep the weapons and ammunition securely. There are three major\nadditional restrictions in the licensing regime imposed by the firearm, as compared with the\nshot gun, certificate. These are\na to obtain a firearm certificate, the applicant has to show the police that he has a good\nreason for possessing all the firearms and ammunition which it covers;\nb  every firearm and piece of ammunition covered by a firearm certificate must be\napproved by the police in advance; and\nc the police may place additional  conditions upon firearm certificates, such as, for\nexample, that the firearm is to be used only at a particular shooting range.\n29. The first two of these differences derive from the fact that the applicant for a firearm\ncertificate has to demonstrate that he has a good reason for possessing 'the firearm or\nammunition in respect of which (the application) is made,' (section 27(1) of the 1968 Act).\nBut the applicant for a shot gun certificate does not (though the police cannot - section 28\n(1A) (b) of the 1968 Act - grant a shot gun certificate if they are satisfied that the applicant\ndoes not have a good reason for possessing a shot gun).\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n33 Dep p7-8\n31\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n30. Similarly, the holder of a shot gun certificate does not have to seek police permission\nbefore obtaining a new shot gun. He must however keep his shot gun certificate up to date\nto list all the guns which it covers (section 28(2A) of the 1968 Act), and both he and the\ndealer, or other person, who sells him a gun is required to notify the police of the sale (see\nthe notes on the rear of the shot gun certificate in the Firearms Rules (Scotland) 1989 and\nsection 4 of the 1988 Act).\n31. The police may add further conditions to a firearm certificate under the terms of\nsection 27 (2) of the 1968 Act. The Act places no limitations on the conditions which the\npolice may impose on a firearm certificate. These vary widely to suit the circumstances, and\nthere is extensive Home Office advice about them in Chapter 6 of the published Home Office\nGuidance to the Police (see Annex C).\n32. However the police may not, in general, add further conditions to a shot gun certificate.\nThe only (minor) exception to that is when the certificate authorises the holder to possess a\nshot gun disguised as another object (for example a walking stick gun) as part of a collection.\n33. The police are then required to add a fifth condition to the shot gun certificate. The\nwording of this is specified by law (Rule 4A of the Firearms (Scotland) Rules 1989, as\ninserted by Rule 4 of the Firearms (Scotland) (Amendment) Rules 1992 - it reads a shot gun\nwhich is disguised as another object is possessed, purchased or acquired by the holder of the\ncertificate only for the purpose of its being kept or exhibited as part of a collection I) . There\nare no circumstances in which the law allows chief officers to formulate additional conditions\nfor a shot gun certificate, as they can with a firearm certificate.\n34. Firearm and shot gun certificates must be renewed at regular intervals. There is scope\nfor firearm certificates to be varied, and there is provision for applicants who disagree with\npolice decisions in respect of them to appeal against these decisions in the Courts.\n \nFirearm Certificates\nSections 27(1) and 27(1A) of the Firearms Act 1968 provide that:\n(1) A firearm certificate shall be granted by the chief officer of police\nif he is satisfied that the applicant has a good reason tor having in his\npossession, or for purchasing or acquiring, the firearm or ammunition in\nrespect of which the application is made, and can be permitted to have it in\nhis possession without danger to the public safety or to the peace:\nProvided that a firearm certificate shall not be granted to a person whom\nthe chief officer of police has reason to believe to be prohibited by this Act\nfrom possessing a firearm to which section 1 of this Act applies, or to be of\nintemperate habits or unsound mind, or to be for any reason unfitted to be\nentrusted with such a firearm.\n[(1A) For the purposes of subsection (1) above a person under the age\nof eighteen shall be capable of having good reason for having a firearm or\nammunition in his possession, or for purchasing or acquiring it, only if he\nhas no intention of using the firearm or ammunition, at any time before he\nattains the age of eighteen, for a purpose not authorised by the European\n32\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nweapons directive.]\nIn commenting on the grant or refusal of firearm certificates the Home Office guidance notes\nthat :34\n6.6 The most important duty imposed by the Act on the police is that of deciding whether\nor not a firearm certificate should be granted. The criteria which chief officers of police\nshould apply in exercising their discretion are set out in section 27(1). A chief officer of\npolice must not grant a certificate to any person whom he has reason to believe to be:\n(a) prohibited by the Act from possessing a firearm, eg a person to whom section 21\napplies; or\n(b) of intemperate habits or unsound mind; or\n(c) to be for any reason unfitted to be entrusted with a firearm.\n6.7 If the grant of the certificate is not so precluded, the chief officer of police has to\nsatisfy himself on two points: that the applicant\n(a) has a good reason for requiring the firearm or ammunition in respect of which the\napplication is made; and\n(b) can be permitted to have the firearm or ammunition without danger to public safety\nor to the peace.\nForces will normally be expected to give reasons for their decision to refuse an application for\na firearm certificate.\nThe guidance sets out a number of points for police officers to bear in mind when considering\napplications for firearm certificates. These include the following 35\n(a) The reason given for desiring a firearm must be one applicable to the particular class\nof firearm which the person desires to possess. It should be recognised that some\nclasses of firearm do have more than one legitimate use.\n(b) The terms of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 make it an offence to kill certain\ntypes of wildlife, and also restrict the type of firearm that can be used in those limited\ncircumstances where killing is permitted. Advice on this Act can be obtained from the\nDepartment of the Environment, Wildlife Division, Tollgate House, Houlton Street,\nBristol BS2 9DJ for use in England and Wales, and from the Department of Agriculture\nand Fisheries for Scotland, Chesser House, Gorgie Road, Edinburgh, for use in\nScotland.\n(c) Similarly, the Deer Act 1963 as amended by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (in\nScotland the Deer (Scotland) Act 1959 and the Deer (Close Seasons) (Scotland) order\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n34 Firearms Law: Guidance to the Police - Home Office (1989) p67-8\n35 ibid p.68-71\n33\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n1984) prohibit the taking of deer at certain times and make it an offence to use certain\ndevices, including some types of firearm and calibres, against then. Schedule 2 to the\nDeer Act 1963 prohibits the use of rifles with a calibre of less than .240 inches or a\nmuzzle energy of less than 1,700 foot pounds. In respect of England and Wales, advice\non the 1963 Act can be obtained from E Division, Home Office, 50 Queen Anne's Gate,\nLondon SW1H 9AT. In respect of Scotland, advice on the deer legislation can be\nobtained from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, Pentland\nHouse, 47 Robbs Loan, Edinburgh, EH14 1TW or the Red Deer Commission,\nKnowsley, 82 Pairfield Road, Inverness, IV3 SLH.\n(d) It should also be established that the land areas over which an applicant intends to shoot\nare suitable from a safety point of view for the class of weapon which it is proposed\nto use (see paragraph 6.22).\n(e) A certificate for a handgun with ammunition should not be granted (except in very rare\ncases) unless the applicant has regular and legitimate opportunity of using the weapon\neg for target practice as a member of a pistol shooting club. Certificates should not,\nhowever, be issued for \"fast draw\" competitions for which adequate non-convertible\nimitation firearms are readily available.\n(f) An applicant wishing to obtain a certificate for a smooth-bore gun with a magazine\ncapable of holding more than two cartridges must demonstrate a reason applicable to\na larger capacity smooth-bore gun. There are relatively few instances in which a\nlimited capacity smooth-bore gun will not serve as well. Claypigeon shooting, for\nexample, does not require a participant to discharge more than two shots before\nreloading and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits the use of the larger\ncapacity weapon to take wildlife other than under certain conditions (see subparagraph\nb above). However, an application to use such a gun, for example, for controlling\nwood pigeons and similar pests on a farm or for practical target shooting by a member\nof a relevant organisation, should normally represent a good reason for the grant of a\ncertificate.\n(g) If the applicant wishes to obtain a certificate for the purpose of collecting firearms\nand/or ammunition, the factors set out in paragraphs 6.13 and 6.14 should be considered\ncarefully.\n(h) Applications for the grant of a firearm certificate for the applicant's protection or that\nof his premises should be refused on the grounds that firearms are not regarded as an\nacceptable means of protection in this country. This principle should be maintained\neven in the case of applications from representatives of banks and firms who desire to\nprotect valuables or large quantities of money.\n(i) Each application should be considered on its merits in respect of the total number of\nfirearms to be held on the certificate, the number of firearms of particular calibres\napplied for and the applicant's security arrangements. The \"good reason\" requirement\nwill need to be satisfactorily demonstrated in respect of each firearm. Thorough\nenquiries must be undertaken regardless of whether this involves making enquiries\noutside the applicant's police area. It is also desirable to have written confirmation of\nan applicant's club membership status or permission to shoot over land. No arbitrary\nlimit should be applied to the number of firearms which may be held. Where firearms\nof a similar calibre are to be used for different purposes, the applicant will need to\nsatisfy the police as to the purpose for which each is required. It should be recognised\n34\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthat target shooters may require several firearms for various disciplines and that persons\nshooting for sporting purposes may require different weapons for variations in game\nand terrain.\n(j) It is not possible to give firm guidance on the amount of ammunition which may be\nauthorised by a certificate. Each case should be dealt with on its merits. While account\nshould be taken of the fact that it is normal practice to purchase ammunition by batches\nfor consistency of performance and that reloading or buying ammunition in bulk is\ncheaper, chief officers will wish to pay regard to the risks attendant upon unnecessarily\nlarge quantities of ammunition being held on private premises. Where larger quantities\nare authorised, particular attention must also be given to the security arrangements.\nThe evidence submitted by the Home Office to the Home Affairs Committee for its inquiry\ninto the Possession of Handguns makes the following observations about current arrangements\nfor assessing an applicant's personal suitability and the requirement that the application be\ncountersigned by a person known to the applicant:36 \nPersonal suitability\n65. In cases where the prohibition under section 21 does not apply, the chief officer\nmust decide on the circumstances of the case whether an applicant with a criminal record\nshould be granted a certificate. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply to\napplications for firearm certificates and a person applying for a certificate must declare any\nconviction by a Court at home or abroad, however old or minor.\n66 The police are sometimes required to make delicate decisions about issuing firearm\ncertificates to people who have criminal records or to people who are thought to have, or to\nhave had, criminal associates but have no conviction. More difficult than these can be cases\nin which the individual is thought to be suffering from mental disorder of some kind,\nespecially ones in which there is no formal indication of it (for instance, no admissions to a\nmental hospital or other medical evidence).\n67. The Government does not give the police central guidance about circumstances of\nthat kind. It is up to chief officers to exercise their statutory discretion. An applicant who\nis dissatisfied with the police decision can take the matter to appeal, or seek judicial review\nof it.\nCountersigning certificate applications\n68. The Firearms (Scotland) Rules 1989 require each application for a firearm certificate\nto be countersigned by a person who is resident in Great Britain, is not a relative of.the\napplicant, and has known them personally for at least two years. The countersignatory must\nalso be a Member of Parliament, Justice of the Peace, minister of religion, doctor, lawyer,\nestablished civil servant, bank officer or \"person of similar standing\".\n69. These categories of person are the same as those who can countersign applications\nfor passports. In practice, we understand that police forces have over the last few years, and\nfollowing a recommendation of the Firearms Consultative Committee, interpreted the phrase\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n36 HC 393-II Session 1995-96 p42\n35\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n\"person of similar standing\" fairly widely so that countersignatures are accepted from a wide\nvariety of people so long as they are of good character and otherwise qualified under the\nRules.\n70. The countersignatory has to confirm that the information which the applicant has\nprovided is, so far as they know, true and to vouch for the passport-size photographs which\nthey provide. The 1989 Rules brought in a further requirement that they should confirm that\nthey \"know of no reason why the applicant should not be permitted to possess a firarm\".\nNotes on the back of the form tell them that they should \"bear in mind the character, conduct\nand mental condition of the applicant in so far as they are relevant. . . \"\n71. The countersignatory may be the applicant's doctor, and in many cases the doctor\ndoes countersign. But a doctor's signature is not required by law.\nShotgun Certificates\nAs the evidence submitted by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to\nthe Cullen Inquiry noted,37 the rules which govern the grant or renewal of shotgun certificates\nare slightly less exacting than those concerning firearm certificates.\nSections 28(1), 28(1A), 28(1B) and 28(1C) of the Firearms Act 1968 provide that:\n(1)Subject to subsection (1A) below, a shot gun certificate shall be\ngranted or, as the case may be, renewed by the chief officer of police if he\nis satisfied that the applicant can be permitted to possess a shot gun without\ndanger to the public safety or to the peace.\n(1A) No such certificate shall be granted or renewed if the chief officer\nof police-\n(a) has reason to believe that the applicant is prohibited by this Act\nfrom possessing a shot gun; or\n(h) is satisfied that the applicant does not have a good reason for\npossessing, purchasing or acquiring one.\n(1B) For the purposes of paragraph (h) of subsection (1 A) above an\napplicant shall, in particular, be regarded as having a good reason if the gun\nis intended to be used for sporting or competition purposes or for shooting\nvermin; and an application shall not be refused by virtue of that paragraph\nmerely because the applicant intends neither to use the gun himself nor to\nlend it for anyone else to use.\n(1C) A person under the age of eighteen shall be regarded for the\npurposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (1A) as not having a good reason\nfor possessing, purchasing or acquiring a shot gun if it is his intention to use\nthe shot gun, at any time before he attains the age of eighteen, for a purpose\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n37 above, p\n36\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nnot authorised by the European weapons directive.\nThe Home Office guidance notes that:38\n7.6 The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 revised the criteria set out in section 28 of the\n1968 Act for the grant or renewal of a shot gun certificate so as to allow chief officers of\npolice more discretion to make enquiries into applications. It is important to note how the\ncriteria differ from those in respect of Applications under section 1 of the Act. No certificate\nshall be granted or renewed if the chief officer of police:\n(a) has reason to believe that the applicant is prohibited by the Act from possessing a\nshot gun; or\n(b) is satisfied that the applicant does not have a good reason for possessing, purchasing\nor acquiring one.\nSection 28(1B) of the Act, as amended, provides for sporting and competition purposes or the\nshooting of vermin to be regarded as good reasons for possessing a shot gun and that an\napplication may not be refused merely because an applicant wants to possess but not use a\nshot gun. This is likely to be the case where the shot gun is of special significance to.the\napplicant, such as an heirloom or of some other sentimental value. However, the Act does\nNOT require the applicant to make out a good case for being granted a certificate but rather\nextends the chief officer's ground for refusing one. A chief officer should therefore need to\nmake further enquiries only where it comes to his notice that there may be genuine doubts\nabout an applicant's reasons for possessing a shot gun.\n7.7 If the grant of a certificate is not so precluded, the chief officer of police has to satisfy\nhimself that the applicant can be permitted to possess a shot gun without danger to the public\nsafety or the peace. This may necessitate an interview and consideration of his security\narrangements. Where a visit to the applicant's home is considered necessary, this should,\nwhere possible, be made by prior appointment. Applicants usually provide a telephone\nnumber where they can be contacted for this purpose. This information is requested on form\n103.\n7.8 The words \"danger to the public safety or to the peace\" also appear in section 27(1)\ndealing with the grant of a firearm certificate. A conviction for a criminal offence which does\nnot result in a sentence to which section 21 applies should not be an automatic bar to the issue\nof a shot gun certificate but convictions for some offences might cast doubt on the ability of\nan applicant to have shot guns without endangering the public safety. Any relevant\ninformation known to the police about the applicant such as mental illness or intemperate\nhabits may be taken into account, but it should be borne in mind that supporting evidence may\nhave to be produced in court if a refused applicant appeals to the Crown Court (in England\nand Wales) or the Sheriff (in Scotland). Forces will normally be expected to give reasons for\nrefusing an application for a shot gun certificate.\nUnder Section 28(2A) of the 1968 Act, a shotgun certificate must specify the description of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n38 Firearms law: Guidance to the Police - Home Office (1989) p87-89 \n37\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthe shotguns to which it relates including, if known, the identification numbers of the guns.\nA shotgun certificate may, therefore relate to more than one weapon, whereas a firearm\ncertificate authorises the possession of the one particular weapon specified on the certificate\nand ammunition for that weapon.\nVariation of Firearm Certificates\nSection 29 of the Firearms Act 1968 enables a chief officer of police for the area in which\nthe holder of a firearm certificate resides to vary, by notice in writing, the conditions under\nwhich the certificate is held. The certificate holder may also apply to the chief officer of\npolice for a variation of these conditions and may appeal to the Courts (the Crown Court in\nEngland and Wales and the sheriff court in Scotland) against the chief officer's refusal to vary\nthem.\nRevocation of Firearm and Shotgun Certificates\nSection 30 of the Firearms Act 1968 permits the revocation of firearm and shotgun\ncertificates in the following circumstances:\n30 Revocation of certificates\n(1) A firearm certificate may be revoked by the chief officer of police\nfor the area in which the holder resides if-\n(a) the chief officer is satisfied that the holder is prohibited by this Act\nfrom possessing a firearm to which section 1 of this Act applies or is\nof intemperate habits or unsound mind, or is otherwise unfitted to be\nentrusted with such a firearm; or\n(b) the holder fails to comply with a notice under section 29(1) of this\nAct requiring him to deliver up the certificate.\n(2) A shot gun certificate may be revoked by the chief officer of\npolice if he is satisfied that the holder is prohibited by this Act from\npossessing a shot gun or cannot be permitted to possess a shot gun without\ndanger to the public safety or to the peace.\nA person aggrieved by the revocation of a certificate may appeal to the Courts against the\ndecision.\nThe circumstances in which firearm and shotgun certificates may be revoked are not exactly\nthe same as those in which an application for the initial grant or renewal of a certificate may\nbe rejected. In particular, there is no clear power for the police to revoke a certificate on the\ngrounds that the \"good reason\" for which it was initially granted no longer applies. The\nevidence submitted by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to the\n38\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nCullen Inquiry noted this and observed that:39\nUnless a certificate holder sustains a criminal conviction during the currency\nof his certificate, the conditions for revocation may not apply in practice.\nThere are not, compared to the overall number of certificates, a large\nnumber of revocations.\nSecurity.\nThe police have no explicit statutory right to inspect applicants' proposed storage\narrangements. They do, however, have a general discretion to grant, renew or revoke\ncertificates, under the provisions of the 1968 Act set out in earlier in this Chapter. In its fifth\nannual report the Firearms Consultative Committee, which was set up under the Firearms\n(Amendment) Act 1988 to keep the provisions of the Firearms Acts under review and make\nrecommendations for procedural improvements and legislative amendments, rejected a\nsuggestion that the police be given a specific statutory right to carry out security inspections\non applicants' premises. The Committee considered that there should be no explicit power,\nbut that it was reasonable for the police to inspect an applicants' security40 \nThe evidence submitted by the Home Office to the Home Affairs Committee for its inquiry\ninto the Possession of Handguns made the following observations about the security of\nfirearms, in the context of police officers' assessments of whether or not an applicant for a\nfirearm certificate could be permitted to have a firearm in his possession without danger to\nthe public safety or to the police:41\n 58. There are two main considerations which the police must have in mind when\nconsidering whether an applicant might, if granted a firearm certificate, be a danger to public\nsafety or to the peace. The first has to do with the security with which the applicant will keep\nany guns or ammunition he is allowed to possess.\n59. Standard condition 4 of the firearm certificate places holders under a duty to take\nall \"reasonable' security precautions, both when the firearm and ammunition are in store at\nhome or elsewhere and when they are in use or in transit. The Home Office has issued a\npamphlet which gives guidance to the police and public on what this means in practice.\n60. There is no bar on holders of firearm certificates keeping their firearms and\nammunition at home, provided that their certificates do not bear a condition which prevents\nthem from doing that. In practice, the vast majority of certificate holders do keep their\nfirearms and ammunition at home, in secure conditions which satisfy the police that they am\nmeeting their legal duty to take all reasonable precautions for their security.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n39 Dep/3 3283 para 79\n40 HC 488 Session 1993-94 p24\n41 HC 393-II Session 1995-96 p42\n39\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n61. The police will generally visit people who are applying for their first firearm\ncertificate, both in order to assess their security arrangements at first hand and to interview\nthem generally about their reasons for wanting to have a firearm and their general background.\nThis allows an assessment of the individual's personal suitability, which is the second issue\nrelating to public safety.\n2. Lord Cullen's Recommendations\nLord Cullen's observations and recommendations on the certification system relating to\nfirearms as defined by Section 1 of the Firearms Act 1968 are set out in detail in Chapter 8\nof his report. He made the following remarks about arrangements for assessing the suitability\nof applicants for firearm certificates:42\n8.56 I use the term \"suitability\" as a convenient expression to cover the provision in section\n27(1) that a firearm certificate is to be granted by the chief officer of police if he is satisfied\nthat the applicant \"can be permitted to have it (the relevant firearm or ammunition) in his\npossession without danger to the public safety or to the peace\" (in so far as this turns on the\npersonal suitability of the applicant); and the provision that the certificate is not to be granted\nto a person whom the chief officer of police \"has reason to believe .... to be of intemperate\nhabits or unsound mind, or to be for any reason unfitted to be entrusted with such a firearm\".\nSection 30(1) enables the chief officer to revoke if he is \"satisfied that the holder ... is of\nintemperate habits or unsound mind. or is otherwise unfitted to be entrusted with such a\nfirearm\".\n8.57 This language is substantially the same as that contained in the Firearms Act 1920,\nwhich was the first legislation for regulating the possession of firearms. Although the\nlanguage is of long-standing it contains a number of difficulties which were discussed at the\nInquiry. These may be summarised as follows.\n8.58 The intention behind the proviso to section 27(1) seems to have been to prohibit the\ngranting of a certificate in certain definite situations; whereas under the leading provision of\nthat sub-section the chief officer of police was to have some discretion in deciding whether\nthe applicant could be permitted to have the relevant firearm or ammunition in his possession.\nIf he was so satisfied he was bound to grant the certificate.\n8.59 However, the matter is not as simple as that. It is not difficult to understand why\n\"unsound mind\" should appear in the proviso. Even if it is wider than insanity and\nencompasses any degree of mental instability, it will be normal for it to be presumed that a\nperson is of sound mind until the contrary appears. It is also a matter which can be\nreasonably closely defined. The same perhaps may be said of \"intemperate habits\" which\nappears to embrace not merely lack of temperance in regard to alcohol or drugs but also\nimmoderate conduct whatever be the cause (see P J Clarke and J W Ellis, The Law relating\nto Firearms (1981) at pages 96-97). Thus far the terms of the proviso appear to deal with\ncases which are irrespective of whether there is danger to the public safety or to the peace in\nthe applicant being permitted to have possession of the firearm or ammunition in question.\nHowever, there is already an overlap between cases which fall foul of the proviso and those\nwhich do not meet the leading provision. When one comes to the expression \"unfitted to be\nentrusted with such a firearm\" it is clear that there is a substantial overlap, and it is in regard\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n42 ibid p94-95\n40\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nto a matter which appears to be primarily a question of judgment. It suggests that the\narrangement of concepts with which the sub-section deals is not of the happiest.\n41\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n8.60 The meaning of \"unfitted\"...... has been little discussed in decisions and text books. It\nis clearly a neglected corner in firearms legislation. When one looks at the Guidance to the\nPolice one finds that after para 6.6 which recites the terms of the proviso the text concentrates\non the question of danger to public safety and to the peace (6.9). This seems to overlook the\npoint that the phrase \"unfitted\"...... is of wide import.\n8.61 When one turns to section 30(1) one finds not merely that there is no provision for\nrevocation where the good reason has ceased but also that the power to revoke is limited to\na situation in which the proviso in section 27(1) would have applied; with the two additional\npeculiarities, that section 30(1) uses \"Is satisfied that\" rather than the somewhat weaker\nexpression \"has reason to believe\"; and that the word \"otherwise\" now appears in front of the\nword \"unfitted\". The mismatching between sections 30(1) and section 27(1) is highlighted by\nthe fact that in the case of shot guns the same test of danger is used both in regard to the\ngranting of the application (section 28(1)) and in regard to the question of revocation (section\n30(2)).\n8.62 1 am bound to say that I consider that it is high time that the language of sections 27\nand 30 is revised in order to achieve a logical and consistent arrangement.\n8.63 However, there is at this point a consideration which is of greater moment in regard to\nthe protection and safety of the public which lies at the heart of the legislation. The\ncircumstances of the present case seem to me to demonstrate the need for a positive\nrequirement that the applicant should be a person who is fit to be entrusted with the relevant\nfirearm and ammunition, so that where the information on this is not seen as persuasive the\ncertificate should be withheld. This entails some reorientation of section 27(1) with the result\nthat the matters as to which the chief officer of police is to be positively satisfied would\ninclude the fitness of the applicant.\n8.64 At the same time I am conscious that, without prejudice to what a court may decide are\nthe limits of \"fitness\", it would be desirable if some guidance could be given to the police and\nto applicants. I am aware that a number of police forces provide leaflets for the guidance of\nshooters but, so far as I have been able to discover, there is no national guidance on the\nsubject. The expression \"unfitted\", in the context in which it is used, seems to me to be\ncapable of embracing deficiencies not merely in physical or mental ability but also in a\nresponsible attitude to such matters as compliance with the legislation, the safe keeping and\nhandling of firearms and elementary co-operation with the licensing authority.\n8.65 As regards section 30(1) 1 consider that it should be brought into full correspondence\nwith section 27(1) with the result that a certificate may be revoked also when the chief officer\nof police is satisfied that the holder cannot be permitted to possess the firearm or ammunition\nwithout danger to the public safety or to the peace.\n42\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nLord Cullen's view of the current requirement for counter-signatories was as follows:43\n8.81 I consider that the current requirement for a counter-signatory should be abolished and\nshould be replaced by a system for the obtaining of references as one source of information\nfor the police. The object of such a system would be to provide the police not with negative\nbut with positive statements about the applicant without imposing on referees the burden of\ndeclaring that the applicant was a fit person to the best of their knowledge and belief. I\nconsider that there should be two referees, neither of whom should be a member of the\napplicant's family. They should both be persons of good character. One of them should be\nan official of an approved shooting club of which the applicant is a member. The other\nshould be a person who is not a member of any shooting club. The latter should have known\nthe applicant personally for at least 2 years. Each of the referees should be expected to supply\na reference to the police in the form of answers to a questionnaire designed to bring out the\nextent and nature of their knowledge of the applicant. with particular reference to his character,\nconduct and mental condition. It would be open to the police to reject a referee who did not\nappear to have adequate knowledge of the applicant. A reference would normally be treated\nas confidential but might require to be made available to the applicant in the event of an\nappeal.\n8.82 I do not support the submission that such referees should be made responsible for\nreporting any subsequent material change of circumstances or be subject to prosecution for\nfailing to do so. It would. in my view, impose such a burden as to be counter-productive.\n8.83 If a system of referees were introduced it would be for the police to decide in the\nparticular case whether and to what extent a reference should be followed up by further\nenquiry of the referees.\nLord Cullen also made the following comments about police powers in relation to firearm\ncertification:44\n8.14 It was pointed out in a number of the submissions that the police do not have an\nexplicit statutory power to insist on inspection of security arrangements prior to the grant or\nrenewal of a firearm certificate or at any time during the life of the certificate. They also do\nnot have an explicit power to insist on inspection of the firearms held. I am not persuaded\nthat it is appropriate to go as far as to grant police a statutory power of entry and inspection\nin connection with the initial grant or subsequent renewal. No doubt the police require to be\nsatisfied in regard to the security arrangements. If the police cannot obtain satisfactory\ninformation about the security arrangements, or for that matter the firearms held, the remedy\nshould be the refusal of the application. If necessary, legislative provision for this can be\nmade. As regards the position during the currency of the certificate I do not consider that\nthere are sufficient grounds to arm the police with a general right to insist on entry and\ninspection regardless of whether there is any apprehension of danger to the public.\n8.15 The Association of Chief Police Officers for England and Wales (ACPO) submitted that\npolice officers should be given the power to enter premises and seize firearms without warrant\non refusal, revocation or suspension of a firearm certificate. The Association of Chief Police\nOfficers in Scotland (ACOPS) submitted that police officers should be given a power to seize\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n43 ibid. p98\n44 ibid p86-87\n43\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\ncertificates, firearms and ammunition prior to any revocation. It may be noted that where a\nfirearm certificate is revoked under section 30(1 )(a) or (2) of the 1968 Act the chief officer\nof police may require the certificate holder by notice in writing to surrender the certificate and\nany firearms and ammunition which are in his possession by virtue of it. Failure to comply\nis an offence (section 12(1) and (2) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988). This would\njustify an application for a warrant to search premises and seize firearms and ammunition\nunder section 46 of the 1968 Act which applies where there is reasonable grounds for\nsuspecting that a relevant offence has been, is being or is about to be committed. However,\nleaving that particular case to one side, there do not appear to me to be explicit powers\nenabling police officers to seize certificates. firearms and ammunition where there is no\nquestion of an offence but where there is reasonable ground for suspecting that there is a\nsubstantial risk to the safety of the public. At present the police have to rely on the co-\noperation of the holder. I consider that provision should be made for such a power to be\ngranted by a justice of the peace or, in Scotland. the sheriff, on the same lines as section 46.\nThe powers under section 46 should also be extended to any civilian licensing and enquiry\nofficer who is authorised in writing by the Chief Constable for that purpose.\n8.16 1 have also noted that while such civilian officers now have the right to possess\nfirearms in the course of their duty without the need to hold a firearm certificate covering\nthem, they do not have the same powers as police officers to inspect dealers' registers and\npremises and approved clubs. I agree with the view that this is an area which needs to be\ndealt with in the process of making civilisation effective.\nThe full list of Lord Cullen's recommendations is set out in his report's concluding chapter.\nMany of his recommendations are concerned with, and can be implemented by changes in the\nHome Office guidance to the police rather than by primary legislation. Those\nrecommendations requiring legislation are as follows:\n4. The power of search with warrant under section 46 of the Firearms\nAct 1968 should be extended to cases in which there is reasonable\nground for suspecting that there is a substantial risk to the safety of the\npublic; and to include in such cases the power to seize and detain any\nfirearm certificate which may he found.\n5. The power of search with warrant under section 46 of the Firearms\nAct 1968 should be extended to any civilian licensing and enquiry officer\nwho is authorised in writing for that purpose by the Chief Constable.\n6. The powers enjoyed by police officers to inspect dealers' registers\nand premises and approved clubs should he extended to civilian\nlicensing and enquiry officers who are authorised in writing for that\npurpose by the Chief Constable.\n9. Section 30(1) of the Firearms Act 1968 should he amended so as to\nprovide for-\n- the revocation of a firearm certificate on the ground that the chief\nofficer of police is satisfied that the holder does not have a good\nreason for having in his possession, or for purchasing or\nacquiring, the firearm or ammunition in respect of which the\n44\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\ncertificate is held; and for partial revocation; and\n- in the case of the revocation of a firearm certificate in respect of\nthe ammunition to which it relates, the power to substitute\ndifferent quantities.\n11. Every bolder of a firearm certificate should he required to be a\nmember of at least one approved club; and the certificate should specify\nthe approved club or dubs of which he or she is a member and the\nwhich he or she intends to use in each of them.\n15. Explicit statutory provision should he made for the laying down\nof criteria for the approval of clubs for the purpose of section 15 of the\nFirearms (Amendment) Act 1988.\n16. The language of section 30(1) of the Firearms Act 1968 should be\nbrought into full correspondence with that of section 27(1); and each\nrevised in order to achieve a logical and consistent arrangement.\nThe Government has accepted all of these recommendations.45 In his statement to the House\nof Commons on the day the Cullen report and the Government's response were published the\nHome Secretary said:46\nLord Cullen has made 23 recommendations for\nstrengthening the regulatory controls on the\nownership and licensing of all guns. We accept\nthem all. The Government's detailed response has\nbeen placed in the Library. There are seven\nrecommendations for improving the way in which\nthe police handle all applications for firearms\ncertificates, a further eight recommendations deal\nwith the grounds for obtaining a firearms\ncertificate, and eight recommendations are about the\nsuitability of individuals to hold firearms.\nI draw particular attention to the following\nrecommendations: in future, anyone applying for a\nfirearms certificate should be assessed against a\nchecklist of criteria for suitability, a clear burden\nshould be placed on the applicant to show that he\nis fit to have a gun, a new power should be created\nto enable the police to revoke a certificate where\nthere is no longer a \"good reason\" for having a\nfirearm, and the grounds on which an appeal\nagainst the refusal of a certificate can be made\nshould be significantly limited. Taken together,\nthose 23 recommendations add up to a drastic\nstrengthening of controls on gun ownership.\nIn addition to Lord Cullen's proposals, we intend to\nintroduce four further measures. First, we shall\nmake it a requirement for all handgun shooters to\nobtain a certificate in order to fire a handgun at a\ngun club. Secondly, we shall make it an offence to\nfail to notify the police whenever a firearm or\nshotgun is sold, transferred, deactivated or\ndestroyed. Thirdly, we propose to ban the sales of\nguns through the post. In future, it will be\nunlawful to transfer a gun from one person to\nanother, except in person.\nFourthly, one of the most shocking and\ndistressing features of the tragic events in Dunblane\nwas the use of expanding ammunition, which is\ndesigned to cause the maximum injury. There is no\npossible justification at all for it to be available for\npeople whose only authority is for target shooting.\nIn future, therefore, it will be illegal to possess\nexpanding ammunition except for the purposes of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n45 The Public Inquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996 - The Government Response\nCm 3393 October 1996 \n46 HC Deb Vol 282 c831-832 16.10.1996\n45\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nshooting deer, in accordance with the Deer Act\n1991.\nThe current law and practice concerning gun clubs and the Government's proposals for the\nlicensing and regulation of pistol and rifle clubs under Part II and Clauses 35 and 36 of the\nFirearms (Amendment) Bill are set out elsewhere in this paper.\n3. Regulation of Firearms and Ammunition - Part III of the Bill\nProhibition of Expanding Ammunition\nClause 25 of the Bill is designed to prohibit expanding ammunition by adding a category of\n\"ammunition which incorporates a missile designed or adapted to expand on impact\" to the\nlist of weapons and ammunition which are subject to general prohibition under Section 5(1A)\nof the 1968 Act and can only be possessed, bought acquired, sold or transferred with the\nauthority of the Secretary of State. Clause 26 will amend Section 5A(4) of the 1968 Act,\nproviding an exception to the prohibition on expanding ammunition by permitting its\ncontinuing use by people who are authorised by firearm certificates which specify that it is\nto be used only for the purpose of lawfully shooting deer or controlling vermin. \n \nThis provision is one of the measures on which the Government said it proposed to take\naction in addition to the recommendations made by Lord Cullen set out in the previous\nsection of this paper. In its initial response the Government said that the exception to the\nprohibition on expending ammunition would extend only to shooting deer.47 The use of\nfirearms to shoot deer is controlled in England and Wales under the Deer Act 1991 and in\nScotland under the Deer (Scotland) Act 1959, as amended by the Deer (Scotland)\n(Amendment) Act 1982. \nIn his report, Lord Cullen made the following remarks about hollow-point ammunition:48 \n    \n9.115 During the course of the inquiry there was some controversy as to\nthe status and acceptability of hollow-point ammunition which is commonly\nused in target shooting in Great Britain. The object of such a bullet is to\nmaximise the transmission of energy to achieve \"stopping power\" and\nminimise over penetration. As part of his evidence to the Inquiry Mr Penn\nexplained that it was undesirable in police or self-defence use that a bullet\nshould exit from its target, or exit with any significant residual energy. since\nthis placed innocent third parties at risk. It was also desirable that bullets\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n47 HC Deb Vol 282 c 832 16.10.1996; Cm 3392 p8\n48 Cm 3386 p131\n46\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthat miss their intended targets should penetrate wood. brick, etc fully so\nthat risks to third parties were reduced. As I recorded in chapter 3 of this\nreport this type of ammunition formed part of what Thomas Hamilton\nbrought with him to the school. On balance I am not satisfied that I should\nmake any recommendation in regard to the availability of such ammunition.\nNotification of the transfer or disposal of firearms \nClauses 27 to 29 are concerned with shotguns as well as firearms. Clause 27 applies where,\n\"in the United Kingdom\" a firearm or ammunition to which Section 1 of the 1968 Act applies\nor a shotgun is transferred to another person who is neither a registered firearms dealer nor\na person entitled to purchase or acquire the firearm or ammunition without a certificate.\nClause 27(2) provides that in such cases:\na) the transferee must produce to the transferor the certificate entitling him\nto purchase or acquire, the firearm or ammunition, being transferred;\nb) the transferor must comply with any instructions contained in the\ncertificate produced by the transferee;\nc) the transferor must hand the firearm or ammunition to the transferee, and\nthe transferee must receive it, in person\n\"Firearm or ammunition\" in clause 27(2) is presumably intended to include shotguns, as the\nClause as a whole applies to the transfer of shotguns, although this is not entirely clear. In\naddition, the Clause refers to the \"United Kingdom\", which includes Northern Ireland,\nalthough neither the Bill itself nor the 1968 Act to which the Clause refers extend to Northern\nIreland. \nClause 28 similarly applies where \"in the United Kingdom\", any firearm to which section 1\napplies is sold, let on hire, lent or given; or any shotgun is sold, let on hire or given, or lent\nfor a period of more than 72 hours. It will require any party to the transfer who is the holder\nof a certificate relating to the firearm in question to give notice to the chief officer of police\nwho granted his certificate within 7 days of the transfer. The notice will have to contain a\ndescription of the firearm in question , including its identification number, if any, the nature\nof the transaction and the name and address of the other party. It will have to be sent by\nregistered post or the recorded delivery service.\nClause 29 is intended to require the holders of firearm or shotgun certificates to notify the\nchief officer of police who granted the certificate within 7 days of the firearm or shotgun\nbeing de-activated, destroyed or lost, or of ammunition to which Section 1 of the 1968 Act\napplies and to which the firearm certificate relates being lost. Where the weapon or\nammunition is lost, notification will be necessary whether the loss occurred as a result of theft\nor otherwise. The notice will have to describe the firearm or ammunition, giving the\n47\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nidentification number, if any, and will have to be sent by registered post or the recorded\ndelivery service. \nA person who fails to comply with the requirements of Clause 27(2), who fails to give the\nnotice required by Clause 28 or who fails, without reasonable excuse to give the notice\nrequired by Clause 29 will commit an offence. The penalties for these offences are set out\nin Clause 30. The offences are all punishable, if committed in relation to a firearm or\nammunition to which Section 1 of the 1968 Act applies, by up to six months' imprisonment\nand a £5,000 fine following summary conviction and by up to five years' imprisonment and\na fine following conviction on indictment. If committed in relation to a shotgun the offence\nwill be punishable on summary conviction by up to six months' imprisonment and a £5,000\nfine.\nChanges to Firearm and Shotgun Certification Procedures\nClause 31 of the Bill sets out the manner in which applications for firearm certificates and\nshotgun certificates are to be made. It will replace current provisions in Section 26 of the\nFirearms Act 1968, which cover both firearm and shotgun certificates, with a Section 26A\nconcerned with applications for firearm certificates and Section 26B concerned with\napplications for shotgun certificates. Like the present Section 26, the new Sections will enable\nthe Secretary of State to make rules under Section 53 of the 1968 Act requiring applicants\nfor firearm and shotgun certificates to provide up to four photographs and to fulfill certain\nother requirements.\nWhere shotgun certificates are concerned these will be much the same as they are at present,\nwith applicants being required to provide verification by another person in a prescribed\nmanner of prescribed particulars, and the person verifying those particulars making a\nstatement that he knows of no reason why the applicant should not be permitted to possess\na shotgun.\nWhere firearm certificates are concerned rules made under the new Section 26A will require\nan applicant to provide two referees (rather than one as at present) who may be required to\nverify prescribed particulars in a prescribed manner, make statements that they know of no\nreason why the applicant should not be permitted to possess a firearm and provide \"such other\nstatements or information in connection with the application as may be prescribed\"\n The period of time for which a firearm or shotgun currently remains in force was increased\nfrom three years to five years in 1994 by the Firearms (Period of Certificate) Order 199449\nand the Firearms (Scotland) (Amendment) Rules 199450. Schedule 2(4) of the Bill inserts a\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n49 SI 1994/2614 \n50 SI 1994/3198\n48\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nnew Section 28A into the Firearms Act 1968, subsection(1) of which will provide that:\nA certificate shall, unless previously revoked or cancelled, continue in force\nfor five years from the date on which it was granted or last renewed, but\nshall be renewable for a further period of five years by the chief officer of\npolice for the area in which the holder resides. \nThe new Section 28A will also permit the Secretary of State to make orders substituting\nother periods for the five year period set out in subsection (1) This power will be exercisable\nby statutory instrument subject to annulment under the negative procedure. Such orders will\napply only to certificates granted or renewed after the date on which th order comes into\nforce.\nWhere a chief officer of police refuses to grant or renew a certificate there will be a right of\nappeal, as there is at present, to the Crown Court in England and Wales or the sheriff in\nScotland.\nWhere at present it is an offence under Section 26(5) of the 1968 Act (punishable by up to\nsix months' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine) for a person to make any statement which he\nknows to be false for the purpose of procuring, whether for himself or any other person, the\ngrant or renewal of a certificate, it will be a similarly punishable offence, by virtue of new\nSection 28A(7) of the 1968 Act for a person knowingly or recklessly to make any statement\nwhich is \"false in any material particular\" for such a purpose. \nClause 32 of the Bill will replace Section 27(1) of the Firearms Act 196851 with a new\nsubsection stating that a firearm certificate shall be granted where the chief officer of police\nis satisfied:\na) that the applicant is fit to be entrusted with a firearm to which Section 1 applies and is not a person\nprohibited by this Act from possessing such a firearm;\nb) that he has a good reason for having in his possession, or for purchasing or acquiring, the firearm or\nammunition in respect of which the application is made; and\nc) that in all the circumstances the applicant can be permitted to have the firearm or ammunition in his\npossession without danger to the public safety or to the peace.\nClause 33 of the Bill is designed to replace Section 30 of the Firearms Act 1968, which is\nconcerned with the revocation of firearm and shotgun certificates, with a number of new\nprovisions. Arrangement for the revocation of shotgun certificates, set out in a new Section\n30C, will not be significantly changed. A chief officer of police will, as now, be able to\nrevoke a shotgun certificate if he is satisfied that the holder is prohibited by the 1968 Act\nfrom possessing a shotgun or cannot be permitted to possess a shotgun without danger to the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n51 set out at p.3 above\n49\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\npublic safety or peace. A person aggrieved by the revocation of a shotgun certificate will be\nable to appeal under Section 44 of the 1968 Act.\nWhere firearm certificates are concerned a new Section 30A will enable a chief officer of\npolice to revoke a firearm certificate in the following circumstances:\n30A.-(1) A firearm certificate may be revoked by the chief officer of\npolice for the area in which the holder resides on any of the grounds\nmentioned in subsections (2) to (5) below.\n(2) The certificate may be revoked if the chief officer of police has\nreason to believe-\n(a) that the holder is of intemperate habits or unsound mind or is\notherwise unfitted to be entrusted with a firearm; or\n(b) that the holder can no longer be permitted to have the firearm or\nammunition to which the certificate relates in his possession without danger\nto the public safety or to the peace.\n(3) The certificate may be revoked if the chief officer of police is\nsatisfied that the holder is prohibited by this Act from possessing a firearm\nto which section I of this Act applies.\n(4) The certificate may be revoked if the chief officer of police is\nsatisfied that the holder no longer has a good reason for having in his\npossession, or for purchasing or acquiring, the firearm or ammunition which\nhe is authorised by virtue of the certificate to have in his possession or to\npurchase or acquire.\n(5) A firearm certificate may be revoked if the holder fails to comply\nwith a notice under section 29(1) of this Act requiring him to deliver up the\ncertificate.\nThe provision enabling a certificate to be revoked of the chief officer of police is satisfied\nthat the holder no longer has a good reason for having in his possession, or for purchasing\nor acquiring the firearm or ammunition authorised under the certificate is designed to\nimplement Lord Cullen's recommendation that greater consistency be achieved between the\nprovisions in Section 27(1) of the 1968 Act concerning the grant or renewal of firearm\ncertificates and those in Section 30 setting out the circumstances in which such certificates\nmay be revoked.52 A new Section 30B will also enable a firearm certificate to be partially\nrevoked (where the holder has more than one firearm) where the chief officer of police is\nsatisfied that the holder no longer has a good reason for having in his possession, or for\npurchasing or acquiring the firearm or ammunition to which it relates. Lord Cullen\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n52 Cm 3386 paras 8.31\n50\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nrecommended that provision be made for partial revocation.53 A person aggrieved by the\npartial or full revocation of a certificate will be able to appeal under Section 44 of the 1968\nAct unless, in the case of a full revocation, the revocation is the result of the holder's failure\nto comply with a notice under Section 29 (1) requiring him to deliver up his certificate so\nthat it can be varied. \nWhere a firearm or shotgun certificate is revoked the chief officer of police will, as now, have\nto write to the holder giving him notice that he is required, in the case of a full revocation,\nto surrender his certificate and in the case of a partial revocation, to deliver it up so that it\ncan be amended. It will be an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to\n£1,00054 for the holder to fail to comply with a notice within 21 days from the date of the\nnotice. \nPowers of Entry, Search and Seizure\nClause 34 of the Bill is designed to replace Section 46 of the Firearms Act 1968, which\nenables a magistrate (or a sheriff in Scotland) to grant a search warrant authorising police\nconstables to enter and search property and seize and detain firearms and ammunition. At\npresent the power to issue warrants is restricted to situations where a magistrate or sheriff is\nsatisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an\noffence relevant for the purpose of the Section (which is most offences under the Firearms\nAct 1968) has been, is being or is about to be committed.\nClause 34 will extend the power under Section 46 by also enabling warrants to be issued\nwhere there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that, in connection with a firearm or\nammunition, there is a danger to public safety or to the peace. Warrants will permit the\npowers of entry, search and seizure to be used by civilian officers as well as police\nconstables. As well as being able, as they are at present, to seize firearms or ammunition\nwhich they find on the premises or on people they reasonably suspect in relation to firearms\noffences, police constables (or civilian officers) will be able to seize imitation firearms,\nfirearm or shotgun certificates and any other document authorising the possession, purchase,\nacquisition, manufacture, sale or transfer of any firearm or ammunition. The extension to\nthese areas of the power of search under Section 46 of the 1968 Act was recommended by\nLord Cullen in his report (see p.41-42 above).55\nIt will be an offence punishable on summary conviction by up to six months' imprisonment\nand a £5,000 fine for a person to obstruct a constable or civilian officer in the exercise of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n53 ibid para 8.32\n54 Schedule 2(9) amending the Firearms Act 1968 Schedule 6 Part I\n55 Cm 3386 paras 8.15.8.16\n51\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthese powers.\n52\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nD. Guns clubs - Part II of the Bill\n1. Background\nThe Home Affairs Select Committee Report on hand guns56 noted that there were 'over 2,500\nrifle or pistol clubs in England, Scotland and Wales' (para. 47). A footnote noted that there\nwere 2,118 rifle and pistol clubs \"approved\" by the Home Office/Scottish Office in England,\nWales and Scotland and it was estimated that there were several hundred \"non-approved\nclubs\".57\nThe Home Affairs Committee Report noted that many clubs did not have suitable sites for\nstorage (para. 66). It also noted that little or no research was available on the rate of offences\ncommitted in approved clubs compared to those committed in non-approved clubs (para. 95).\nFurther details on rifle and pistol clubs was given in an extract from the Home Office\nResearch and Planning Unit 1993 publication:58\nNumbers of clubs\nAccurate accounts of the numbers of rifle and pistol clubs are rare, but it has been possible\nto get some idea of their changes over the last quarter century by looking at how many clubs\nwere affiliated at different times to target shooting associations. The oldest is the National\nRifle Association (NRA), founded in 1859, which had 800 miniature, as well as full-bore, rifle\nclubs affiliated to it in 1920. In 1971 there were 580 clubs, 105 schools (mostly cadet corps),\nand 90 associations in membership. By 1980 the number of clubs had grown to 832 and in\n1990 the figure stood at 982. In 1992 there were 1,000 clubs and 90 cadet corps affiliated to\nthe NRA, representing some 60,000 shooters, and there were 4,500 individual members. In\naddition, there were affiliated associations. The NRA is now mostly concerned with full-bore\ncentre-fire firearms. The majority (about 84 per cent) of its rifle and pistol clubs are\napproved. Those clubs participating in the survey had an average (median) size of 40\nmembers.\nThe Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs broke away from the NRA in the early part of this\ncentury and in 1920 had 2,000 clubs affiliated to it. The Society later became the National\nSmall-Bore Rifle Association (NSRA) which, like the NRA, is a governing body recognized\nby the Sports Council. In 1965 there were about 4,000 clubs affiliated to the NSRA but by\n1970 this had dropped to 3,160 (of which 2,700 were approved). This represented club\nmembership of 111,000 (45,000 under 18 and 66,000 aged 18 and over). In 1971 3,600 clubs\nwere affiliated, some 650 of which were junior clubs. The number of affiliated clubs fell to\n1,990 in 1990. By 1992 the number was down to 1,600 representing club membership of\n25,000. In addition there were 35,000 belonging to junior clubs. The NSRA is primarily\nconcerned with air weapons, pistol and .22 rifle shooting. Some 79 per cent of its rifle and\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n56 HC 393 Session 1995/96 Possession of Hand Guns\n57 Footnote 121 pxvii\n58 Approval of rifle and pistol target shooting clubs: the effects of the new and revised criteria by John Martin\nCorkery 1993 Home Office Research and Planning Unit Paper 79\n53\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\npistol clubs are currently approved. The average (median) size of clubs participating in the\nsurvey affiliated to this association was about 24.\nThe National Pistol Association (NPA) broke away from the NRA about 1970 and by 1980\nthere were 106 clubs affiliated, with a membership of 5,000. The number of affiliations has\ncontinued to grow, to 390 clubs with a membership of 24,500 in 1985 and to 500 clubs with\na membership of 36,000 in 1992. Most of the clubs are thought to be approved. The average\n(median) size was 59 members.\nA memorandum by the Secretary of State and the Home Secretary for the Home Affairs\nSelect Committee summarised the current position as follows:\nRIFLE AND PISTOL CLUBS\n39. A member of a rifle or pistol club which has been approved by the Secretary of State\nmay possess (but not purchase or acquire) a rifle or pistol without a certificate when engaged\nas a member of that club in, or in connection with, target practice (section 15 of the 1988\nAct). The Secretary of State's approval of a club is subject to it meeting a number of criteria,\nrevised at the beginning of 1996, which are set out in a leaflet.\n40. There are a total of 2,118 approved clubs throughout Great Britain, 247 of them in\nScotland. To qualify for approval under section 15, a club must generally have at least 10\nmembers. They vary greatly in size and there are differing estimates of the total approved\nclub membership. Many individuals belong to more than one club.\n41. Full membership of an approved club effectively allows a person to shoot there, using\na rifle, revolver or pistol and the ammunition for it, without having a firearm certificate of\ntheir own. There are four categories of approval-for full and small-bore rifle and for full and\nsmall-bore pistol (including revolvers).\n42. The guns and ammunition which club members use need not necessarily belong to\nthe club - they might, for instance, be the personal property of another club member who\nholds a firearm certificate. A club member may also use his own firearms and ammunition,\nheld on a firearm certificate which the police have issued to him personally, at the club range.\n43. It is usual for clubs to have their own firearms and ammunition for members to use.\nThese are generally listed on a firearm certificate which the police have issued to a responsible\nmember of the club, for instance its Chairman or Secretary. Under section 32(2) of the 1968\nAct, the police issue this certificate without the usual fee.\n44. The club approval criteria require all new members to be sponsored by at least one\nexisting club member. If not already experienced with firearms, the new member must go\nthrough a period of probation lasting at least three months, during which they must be given\na course in the safe handling of firearms and attend and shoot regularly under supervision.\n45. Club approval lasts for six years. Most club approvals lapsed, and had to be renewed,\nin June 1992 (under section 15(9) of the 1988 Act). They therefore fall to be renewed again\nin 1998. Renewal requires the club to complete a form (\"form 124\") and submit it to the\nHome Office or Scottish Office via the police. This allows the police to inform the Home\nOffice or Scottish Office of how the club is run and whether they support the application.\n46. A club's approval can be withdrawn at any time if police or other reports indicate that\n54\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nit is not being run in accordance with the criteria or that there is any other difficulty with it.\nClubs are under no duty to pass to the police, or each other, information about members who\nresign or are expelled, or about would-be members whom they have turned away.\n47. The way in which clubs store their weapons and ammunition varies. Some have\nsecure stores at their ranges, at which they keep all their weapons and ammunition. In other\ncases, club members who have suitable firearm certificates keep the club's firearms and\nammunition securely at home. In all cases, the police must be satisfied that the arrangements\nmeet the requirement of the firearm certificate that firearm and ammunition be stored securely.\nIt is also a requirement of the club approval criteria that club firearms and ammunition \"be\nstored securely\".\n48. Some rifle and pistol clubs operate without approval under section 15. That is\nperfectly proper, as long as all those who shoot at these clubs hold individual firearm\ncertificates and abide by their terms and conditions, which will specify the guns that they can\nhave in their possession and where they can shoot with them. The Government has no\ninformation about the number and membership of clubs which operate in this way.\n2. Current legislation\nAn extract from a report from the Research and Planning Unit of the Home Office59 sets out\nthe rules for the approval of rifle and pistol clubs:\nApproval of rifle and pistol clubs by the Secretary of State\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 was introduced following a review of firearms\nlegislation after the Hungerford incident, Under Section 15 (1) of the Act, members of rifle\nand pistol clubs which have been approved by the Secretary of State are exempted from\ncertain provisions of the legislation regarding firearms. Members of such clubs are permitted\nto possess firearms and ammunition when engaged as a member of the club, in or in\nconnection with target practice, without holding a firearm certificate (FAC). A similar\nexemption was introduced by the Firearms Act 1920, as was the concept of approved status,\nand this has been re-enacted by subsequent legislation. There is no requirement for a club to\nseek approval but only the members of approved clubs may benefit from the firearm certificate\nexemption. Section 15 of the 1988 Act came into force on I July 1989 and introduced, for\nthe first time, a six year approval and renewal period and a fee for approval. It gave the\npolice, also for the first time, the right of entry to club premises. It caused the approval of\nany club approved under Section 11(3) of the Firearms Act 1968 to expire on 30 June 1992.\nIn order to gain approval, a club is required to satisfy certain criteria laid down by the\nSecretary of State. Essentially, prior to Section 15 coming into force in 1989, the Secretary\nof State asked the police to check the bona fades of the club and confirm that a range safety\ncertificate covering the appropriate categories of weapons existed for each range used by the\nclub. Any premises where weapons were stored also had to be sufficiently secure.\nAlthough members of an approved club may possess firearms and ammunition without holding\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n59 Approval of Rifle and pistol target shooting clubs: the effects of the new and revised criteria - by John Martin\nCorkery 1993 Home Office Research and Planning Unit Paper 79 \n55\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\na certificate, the exemption does not extend to their purchase. In order for a club to purchase\nfirearms and ammunition a responsible officer of the club needs to hold an FAC. No fee is\npayable for an FAC granted to a responsible member of an approved club, nor is any fee\npayable for the variation or renewal of such a certificate.\nUnder Section 11(4) of the Firearms Act 1968 a person conducting or carrying on a miniature\nrifle range (whether as a rifle club or otherwise) or shooting gallery at which no firearms are\nused other than air weapons or miniature riles may possess, or purchase or acquire miniature\nrifles and ammunition for them without holding a firearm certificate. Any person may use any\nsuch miniature rifle and ammunition at such a range or gallery. Clubs operating as miniature\nrifle ranges under Section 11(4) of the Act would gain no benefit from approval under Section\n15(1).\nApproval therefore indicates only that the club is equipped for the supervision and induction\nof novice shooters; non-approved shooters are groups of certificate holders who meet to\npursue their shooting interests, and who do not seek to recruit novice shooters.\nThe criteria for approval were substantially revised in 1989 following two tragic shooting\nincidents in the Greater Manchester Police area. The then Home Secretary, David\nWaddington, felt that it was unacceptable for a casual caller to sign on at a club as a day or\ntemporary member and have immediate access to firearms and ammunition. Following\nconsultations with the Firearms Consultative Council,60 the revised criteria were issued to all\napproved clubs on 15 March 1990 in England and Wales and 5 April 1990 in Scotland. They\nwere reviewed again in 1995 and the concept of 'novice' membership abolished in favour of\n'probationary' membership from 1 January 1996. The period of probation was reduced from\nthe 6 months operative for 'novice' membership to three months. A new requirement that\nmembers, prospective members and guests must sign a declaration to say that they are not\nprohibited from possessing a firearm was added and the number of days on which a club\ncould allow non-members to shoot as individually supervised guests was increased from 4 a\nyear to 12.\nThe current criteria are set out in an extract from the Home Office leaflet Firearms: Approval\nof Pistol and Rifle Clubs:61\nCriteria for Approval\nClubs will not be granted approval unless they meet\nthe criteria which ore set out below. Approved\nclubs which cease to conform to the criteria can \nexpect that the approval will be withdrawn. The\ncriteria are:\n the club is a genuine rifle or pistol club with a\nwritten constitution;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n60 a statutory body set up under S.22 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 to review the provisions of the\nFirearms Acts and make recommendations for improving their working \n61 the Cullen inquiry noted that it would be preferable to have an explicit statutory provision for the issuing of\ncriteria for approval [para. 8.53] \n56\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n the principal officers of the club are\nresponsible persons who can be entrusted with\nthe proper administration of the club;\n the club has at least 10 members of the time of\napplication for approval and at all times whilst,\napproved unless, exceptionally, the Secretary of\nState determines that there are special\ncircumstances which justify a lesser number;\n members must be of good character;\n members, prospective members and guests\nmust be asked to sign a declaration to say that\nthey are not prohibited from possessing a\nfirearm or ammunition by virtue of section 21\nof the Firearms Act 1968 (as amended). (This\nwill usually apply to persons who have served\na term of imprisonment);\n the club has regular use of ranges with safely\ncertificates for the categories of firearm in\nrespect of which approval is sought or given,\nas the case may be;\n the security arrangement for the storage of club\nfirearms and ammunition are satisfactory,\n the club does not run a day or temporary\nmembership scheme;\n the club does not have more than 12 guest\ndays a year. Guest members must be either\nmembers of a recognised outside organisation\n(see note 8 below) or individuals who are\nknown personally to at least one full member\nof the club;\n guests must be supervised on a one-to-one\nbasis at all times when handling firearms and\nammunition, by either a full club member or\nsomeone who is a coach with a qualification\nrecognised by the Great Britain Target\nShooting Federation and governing bodies.\nThe club secretary must notify each guest day\nto the police firearms licensing department of\nthe area in which the guest day is to take\nplace, at least 48 hours in advance;\n anyone who applies for probationary\nmembership must be sponsored by at least one\nfull club member;\n before becoming a full member, individuals\nmust have a probationary period of at least 3\nmonths during which time they must attend\nand shoot regularly. The probationary member\nmust be given a course in the safe handling\nand use of firearms on a one-to-one basis by\nsomeone who is either a full member of the\nclub or who is a coach with a qualification\nrecognised by the Great Britain Target\nShooting Federation and governing bodies;\n once a probationary member has satisfactorily\ncompleted a course in the safe handling and\nuse of firearms, he/she must be supervised at\nall times when in possession of firearms or\nammunition by either the range officer, or a\nfull member of the club, or someone who is a\ncoach with a qualification recognised by the\nGreat Britain Target Shooting Federation and\ngoverning bodies;\n the probationary period may be waived, at the\nClub's discretion, for someone who\n- is already a full member of another club\nwhich has been approved by the Secretary\nof State in respect of the same type or\ntypes of firearm; or\n- holds a firearm certificate; or\n- has handled firearms in the course of\nhis/her duty in the police or the armed\nservices, and has a statement from his/her\nexisting or former senior/commanding\nofficer saying that he/she is fully trained\nin handling the type of firearms in respect\nof which the club has obtained approval\nand is able to use them safely without\nsupervision;\n the club never has more probationary members\nthan full members unless the Secretary of State\ndetermines that there are special circumstances\nwhich justify a greater number of probationary\nmembers; and\n there is nothing else that would make the club\n57\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nunsuitable for approval.\nNotes on the Criteria\n1. The club must be a genuine rifle and\npistol club, set up for the purpose of target\npractice. The constitution of the club\nshould implement the requirements of the\ncriteria.\n2. Clubs should make their own\narrangements for assessing whether\nmembers or prospective members are of\ngood character. Police firearms licensing\ndepartments should not be asked to\ndisclose whether someone has a criminal\nrecord or not. Prospective members\nshould not be required to apply for a\nfirearm or shot gun certificate as a means\nof determining 'good character'. The\npolice will not normally grant a certificate\nbecause somebody is a probationary\nmember of a club.\n3. The National Associations are able to\nprovide advice on the construction and use\nof ranges. Clubs which are affiliated to\nthe National Rifle Association or the\nNational Small Bore Association will be\nable to obtain a safety certificate for their\nrange from the Ministry of Defence.\n4. Recognised coaching qualifications for the\npurposes of the Home and Scottish Office\ncriteria for approved clubs are\nGreat Brita in Target Shooting\nFederation - Coach Educator, Advanced\nCoach, Senior Coach and Primary Coach;\nNational Rifle Association - Club\nInstructor (Rifle), Club Instructor (Pistol)\nand Range Conducting Officer; and\nNational Small-bore Rifle Association -\nRange Conducting Officer, Range\nConducting Officers Assessor, Cadet Adult\nInstructor and Regional Coaches.\n5. The National Associations are able to give\nadvice on safety training courses for\nprobationary members.\n6. A club may end a probationer's\nmembership at any time or extend the\nprobationary period if it considers that this\nis necessary.\n7. The Secretary of State may, in exceptional\ncases such as university or college clubs -\nallow a club to have more probationary\nmembers than full members.\n8. Examples of recognised outside\norganisations whose members may be\nguest members of approved rifle and pistol\nclubs are Scouts and Guides, schools,\nRotary Clubs and Women's Institutes.\n9. Clubs can have non-shooting categories of\nmembership such as associate, family,\nsocial or honorary members. Such\nmembers are not covered by section 15 of\nthe Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 and\nmust not, under any circumstances, have\nany access to firearms or ammunition.\nThe Cullen inquiry62 noted that unapproved clubs were not subject to any form of inspection:\n8.39 At the same time it has to be borne in mind that some rifle and\npistol clubs. the exact number of which is not known, operate without the\nneed for approval under section 15. In such clubs the participants should all\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n62 The Public Inquiry into the shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996 Cm 3386\n58\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nhave their own firearm certificates and are expected individually to abide by\ntheir terms and conditions. Such clubs are in themselves not subject to\nlegislation, and are not subject to any form of statutory inspection. Mr D J\nPenn pointed out that some of these \"clubs\" amount to no more than a\nmeans by which a group of people who share an interest in a certain type\nof firearm or competition get together on an informal basis on certain\noccasions during the year.\nPolice powers to visit and enter rifle clubs vary according to status; \"approved\" clubs can be\ninspected to ascertain whether the conditions on which approval is granted is being complied\nwith63 but there is no equivalent power to inspect non-approved clubs.64\nDetailed guidance to the police on rifle and pistol clubs and cadet corps was given in\nFirearms Law: Guidance to the Police HMSO 1989, Chapter 13. The Guidance covers\nmatters such as siting of ranges, security of club premises and administration of clubs, and\nnotes that general approval to Combined Cadet Forces, Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force\nand Air Training Corps has been granted under S.11(3) of the 1988 Act.\n3. The Cullen Report recommendations for gun clubs\nThe Cullen Report did not recommend the wholesale prohibition of guns, but considered\nimprovements to the certification system and discussed the need for each holder of a firearm\ncertificate to be a member of at least one approved club, and for approved clubs to keep a\nrecord of the activities of their members who are holders of firearm certificates, and to inform\nthe police of the termination of membership or non-attendance for a substantial period. The\nGovernment response to Cullen (Cm 3392) accepted the following recommendation on gun\nclubs:\n10. Each club which is approved for the purposes of section 15 of the Firearms\n(Amendment) Act 1988 should he required to maintain a register of the attendance of its\nmembers who are holders of firearm certificates, together with details as to the firearms\nwhich they used and the competitions in which they participated when they attended.\nThe Government accepts this recommendation. The approval criteria for clubs will be\namended (see recommendation 15).\n11. Every holder of a firearm certificate should be required to be a member of at least\none approved club; and the firearm certificate should specify the approved club or clubs\nof which he or she is a member and the firearms which he or she intends to use in each\nof them.\nThe Government accepts this recommendation, for holders of firearm certificates for target\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n63 S.15(5) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 \n64 Home Affairs Select Committee Report Possession of Hand Guns HC 393 Session 1995/96 para. 96\n59\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nshooting. The Government will bring forward the necessary changes in primary legislation.\n12. Each approved club should be required to inform the police when a holder of a\nfirearm certificate has ceased to be a member of the club for whatever reason.\n13. Each approved club should be required to inform the police when a member who is\nthe holder of a firearm certificate has not attended a meeting of the club for a period of\na year.\n14. The proposal that each club should appoint a person to act as a liaison officer with\nthe police is endorsed.\nThe Government accepts these 3 recommendations and will amend the approval criteria for\nclubs (see recommendation 15).\n15. Explicit statutory provision should be made for the laying down of criteria for the\napproval of clubs for the purpose of section 15 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988.\nThe Government accepts this recommendation. The Government intends to give statutory\nforce to the approval criteria for clubs (amended in line with recommendations 10, 12 to 14,\n19 and 20).\n4. Part II of the Bill - the details\nIn the statement following publication of the Cullen Report Michael Howard, the Home\nSecretary, proposed that high calibre hand guns no longer remain in private ownership, and\nthat low calibre hand guns (22 rimfire hand guns) would have to be used and kept in licensed\nclubs.65\nThe clubs in which it will still be possible to\nuse .22 handguns will be subject to the most\nstringent security standards. We shall consult as a\nmatter of urgency chief constables and other\ninterested parties on the details of the standards,\nand we shall set them out clearly in guidance. In\naddition, every individual club will need to be\napproved by the chief constable of the area in\nwhich it is situated. Handguns will be able to be\nremoved from a club only for strictly limited\npurposes, which will be specified in law, and under\nthe most stringent controls.\nFew, if any, existing gun clubs will be able to\nmeet those requirements. When the powers become\nlaw, we shall therefore require any owner of a .22\nrimfire handgun to hand his gun to the police for\nsafekeeping until he is able to find a licensed club\nthat he can join. We shall then provide a period\nfor clubs to improve their security, and to be\ninspected and licensed. Some handgun clubs may\nnever be able to achieve an adequate level of\nsecurity. If so, they will have to close.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n65 HC Deb vol 282 16/10/96 c.833-834\n60\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nIn response Jack Straw, Shadow Home Secretary, said that the Government proposal was an\nunsatisfactory compromise:66\nThe problem with the compromise on clubs\nproposed by the Secretary of State is that there will\nstill be 40,000 handguns, including many\nsemiautomatics, remaining in private ownership-\nalbeit for use in clubs. I am aware that the\nSecretary of State proposes tight new controls on\nthe gun clubs that are allowed to remain. Is he not\naware of a most compelling case made against the\nhalfway house by the British Shooting Sports\nCouncil in its evidence to the inquiry, in paragraph\n9.68 on page 121? Referring to the crucial issue of\nthe booking out of weapons, even with tighter\ncontrols, the BSSC said:\n\"no matter what system of checks and paperwork is\nmaintained in such circumstances, it would be a simple\nmatter indeed for a shooter intent in recovering his guns to\nenter a competition, provide evidence to his club secretary\nthat he had done so, recover possession of the complete gun\ntogether with ammunition for it, and perpetrate an outrage\".\nIn the light of that evidence not least, I ask the\nSecretary of State to think again about the proposal\nto allow the licensing of some gun clubs before the\nBill is published.\nIn response to a question from Alan Beith MP, Mr Howard said that he envisaged that the\ntransportation of guns from one club to another would be permitted in \"only the most limited\ncircumstances and under the most stringent controls. For instance, the transportation should\nbe effected not by the owner of the gun but by a third party specifically authorised for that\npurpose\" (c.837).\nThe Bill allows for the establishment of licensed gun clubs once a target pistol shooting club\nhas proved that it can merit the necessary criteria. Clause 13 provides that no small calibre\npistols are allowed on club premises unless the club has a licence and the holder of the\ncertificate relating to the pistol is a member of the club and the premises are specified in the\ncertificate as those where the gun is to be stored and used. Pistol clubs will therefore have\nto become licensed clubs in order to operate in future. Clause 13(3) provides that an offence\nis committed where a small calibre pistol is used or stored in contravention of the Clause,\nwith imprisonment for up to 6 months or a £5,000 fine. Clause 14 will allow the responsible\nofficer of a licensed club to store and handle members' pistols without a firearms certificate\nfor those pistols.67\nThe granting of licences is governed by Clause 15 which provides for the Secretary of State\nto grant a licence in respect of the club and club premises. A fee of £150 would be payable.\nClause 16 enables the Secretary of State to publish guidance on the criteria for licences for\nthe purposes of informing applicants. A licence may only be granted if the Secretary of State\nis satisfied that the arrangements for storing and using small calibre pistols are such that their\nstorage or use will not endanger the public safety or the peace, following consultations with\nthe chief officer of police for the area in which the premises are situated. No official detail\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n66 HC Deb vol 282 16/10/96 c.833-834 \n67 the term \"responsible officer\" is defined in Clause 12. See the note on Clause 21 on the following page \n61\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nis available at present about the criteria for licences. Clause 17 provides that the licence is\nto be granted subject to conditions for ensuring public safety and the peace, and an offence\nis committed if the conditions are not complied with. Licences are to last for 5 years, but\nwill be removable for further periods of 5 years. There is power in Clause 18(2) for the\nSecretary of State to substitute shorter or longer periods by order. The Secretary of State may\nvary the terms and conditions of a licence if he thinks fit under Clause 19 and revoke the\nlicence under Clause 20 at any time, if he thinks fit.\nA pistol register will have to be kept by a \"responsible officer\" of a licensed pistol club under\nClause 21. A \"responsible officer\" is defined in Clause 12 as the officer of the club to whom\nthe licence was granted, or who has become the responsible officer following a variation in\nthe terms of the licence. The register will contain particulars of each pistol stored at the\npremises, namely the name and address of the person authorised by the firearm certificate to\nhave the pistol in his possession; the date the pistol was first stored at the club; and the date\nand time of the return of the pistol after removal.\nThe information on a pistols register will be kept for at least 5 years, as available for\ninspection, and further particulars may be required by regulations to be made under Clause\n22 which allows the Secretary of State to prescribe requirements in relation to licensed pistol\nclubs and their operation, impose obligations in the responsible officer or persons responsible\nfor the management of a licensed pistol club and impose obligations on those authorised\nunder S.14(2) to handle members' pistols without a certificate. No further detail is available\non the regulations which may be issued under this Clause. The regulations will be subject\nto annulment by either House of Parliament under the negative resolution procedure for S.Is.\nAuthorised police officers will have the power of entry and inspection under Clause 23 to\nascertain that the legislation conditions on a licence are being complied with and Clause 24\nmakes it an offence to make a false statement for the purpose of obtaining a licence.\nFinally, in Part III of the Bill Clause 36 substitutes a new Section 15 for the Firearms\n(Amendment) Act 1988 which makes clear that pistol clubs can no longer receive approval\nunder S.15 since they must be licensed under Part II of the Bill. The new wording for S.15\nwill also give specific statutory authorisation for the Secretary of State to publish guidance\nabout the criteria to be applied with regard to the approval of rifle clubs under S.15 thus\nfulfilling the recommendation in the Cullen Report (see above p.56-57).\n62\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nThere is no provision in the Bill for compensation to be paid for pistol clubs which may have\nto close if they cannot meet the criteria for licensing, nor are there proposals for grants to\nassist towards the cost of providing secure premises for small calibre pistols. In the\nExplanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill the business compliance cost assessment\nnotes that the Bill \"will result in increased costs for clubs which choose to become licensed\npistol clubs. The level of costs involved will depend on the extent of their existing security\narrangements and the precise requirements which will be imposed under the Bill. These costs\ncannot currently be quantified\". Government amendments were introduced to the 1988\nFirearms (Amendment) Act during the passage of the Bill to compensate owners of weapons\nwhich would be prohibited under the 1988 Act, but the Government emphasised that it could\nnot be regarded as any sort of precedent.68 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n68 Douglas Hogg, Home Office Minister, HC Deb 17/5/88 vol 133 c.375W\n63\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nE. Compensation\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 brought high powered self-loading rifles, burst fire\nweapons and repeating short-barrelled smooth-bore guns within the prohibited category under\nS.5 of the Firearms Act 1968, which means that special authority is required from the\nSecretary of State to possess or deal with them. The question of compensation for those who\nhad lawfully held such firearms was raised early in proceedings on the Bill which became the\n1988 Act, and which, as first presented, contained no provisions to allow such payments. The\nWhite Paper, Firearms Act 1968: Proposals for Reform69 had taken a firm line on the\nquestion of compensation:\n47. The Government has also looked carefully at the question of compensation for those\npeople who now own weapons which will become prohibited. We have concluded that as a\nmatter of principle it is undesirable and unjust to require the taxpayer at large to pay for the\nremoval from the public domain of weapons which are an acknowledged threat to life.\nAlthough there will be no market for prohibited weapons in this country, authorised dealers\nwill still be able to export them abroad, and owners will be able to recover some of the value\nin this way. Where they choose not to do so, facilities will be provided for them to be handed\nin to the police in the course of the forthcoming firearms amnesty.\nOn second reading, on 21 January 1988, the Home Secretary Douglas Hurd pointed out that\n\".... On the occasions when certain products have been banned by domestic or European\nlegislation, no compensation has been paid, and it would therefore be inequitable to pay it in\nthis instance\".70 Considerable pressure during the debate on the Money Resolution resulted\nin an undertaking to look again at the question, but it was made clear during the first sitting\nof Standing Committee F on 4 February 1988, when the sittings motion was lost, that\nprogress on the relevant clauses would depend on a clear policy statement on the question of\ncompensation. At the beginning of the second sitting on 9 February 1988, Mr Hogg\nannounced the Government's agreement to the principle of a buy-in policy.71 The power to\nmake a scheme for payments in respect of prohibited weapons was provided by S.21 of the\nAct.\nDebates of the scheme were announced on 17 May 1988:72\nSir Eldon Griffiths: To ask the Secretary of\nState for the Home Department whether he will\nnow publish details of the buy-in scheme in respect\nof firearms whose prohibition is proposed in the\nFirearms (Amendment) Bill.\nMr. Douglas Hogg: The proposed \"buy-in\"\nscheme would operate for a period of three months\nfrom the date on which the relevant provisions\ncame into force. Transitional arrangements would\nbe introduced to allow continuing possession of the\nfirearms involved during that period.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n69 Cm 261, December 1987 \n70 HC Deb. 125, c.1111 \n71 SC Deb. c.36\n72 HC Deb. 133, c.375-6W\n64\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nPayments under the scheme would be made to\npersons in respect of firearms which would become\nprohibited under the Bill and which were lawfully\nheld by them on a firearm or shotgun certificate on\nor before 22 September 1987, when my right hon.\nFriend announced the Government's intentions in a\nspeech to the Association of Police Superintendents.\nCertificate holders who acquired such firearms after\nthat date because of a previous binding contract to\npurchase would also be accommodated where\nevidence of the contract could be produced. In\naddition, such holders who acquired them before\nand sold them after 22 September 1987 would be\neligible upon production of evidence of sale.\nClaimants would be required to complete a\nclaim form obtainable from a police station or rifle\nor pistol club and to surrender the qualifying\nfirearm(s). They would also have to produce the\nrelevant firearm or shotgun certificate to the issuing\npolice force, and police records would be noted\naccordingly.\nWe expect that most claims would be for self-\nloading rifles. For these, two options would be\navailable. Claimants could apply for a fixed sum\npayment of £150. This figure takes account of the\nprice which self-loading rifles of the Kalashnikov\nand equivalent models would have fetched at\nauction before my right hon. Friend's\nannouncement of 22 September 1987. \nAlternatively, for the small number of firearms of\nconsiderably higher value, claimants could provide\nevidence of the purchase price or insurance value.\nPayment under this option would be 50 per cent. of\nthe average retail value of the firearm in the\nsummer of 1987. This formula is designed to\nproduce the amount which in general an individual\nmight reasonably expect to have obtained on the\nsale of the item at auction in the summer of 1987.\nClaimants who sold self-loading rifles after 22\nSeptember 1987 would be paid the difference\nbetween the sum received from the sale and the\nsum determined by an application under whichever\nof the two options were to be exercised.\nIn respect of all other firearms which would\nbecome prohibited, payment would be available\nonly under the second option, and where\naccompanied by the relevant documentary evidence.\nAny case that could not be reasonably determined\nby the application of these arrangements would be\nconsidered at the discretion of my right hon.\nFriend the Home Secretary, or in Scotland at the\ndiscretion of my right hon. and learned Friend the\nSecretary of State for Scotland.\nWe have proposed the scheme because of the\nunique circumstances involved: namely, that\nindividuals would be prohibited from holding\nfirearms which they were previously authorised to\nhold by the issue of a firearm or shotgun certificate\nand which have lost most or all of their market\nvalue. It cannot be regarded as any sort of\nprecedent.\nS.21 of the 1988 Act came into force on 1 February 1989 and the scheme ran until 30 April\n1989. Details of the number of firearms for which compensation was paid in England and\nWales and the costs involved were provided on 5 November 1996:73\nSir Jerry Wiggin: To ask the Secretary of\nState for the Home Department how many guns\nhave been surrendered as a result of the\nprohibitions introduced by the Firearms\n(Amendment) Act 1988; how many claims for\ncompensation remain to be settled; and what was\nthe total cost of compensation paid to date.\nMiss Widdecombe: The Department received\nnearly 3,000 claims relating to around 3,600\nfirearms under the Government buy-in-scheme for\nweapons which became prohibited by virtue of the\nFirearms (Amendment) Act 1988. A total of\n£620,000 was paid in relation to those claims. The\nDepartment has considered all claims made under\nthe scheme and advised claimants of the outcome.\nOffers have been made to all claimants entitled to\nreceive compensation.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n73 HC Deb. 284, c.433W \n65\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nThe EC Directive on the Control of the Acquisition and Possession of Weapons came into\nforce for Great Britain on 1 January 1993. It was implemented by the Firearms Acts 1968\n(Amendment) Regulations 199274 and prohibited the possession of disguised firearms such as\nwalking stick shotguns and guns shaped like cigarette lighters except by recognized collectors,\nmuseums and others duly authorised. On this occasion, owners could apply for an ex-gratia\npayment if they surrendered their disguised firearms to the police, and payments were to be\nbased on the market value that the firearm might reasonably have attained immediately before\nthe ban was announced.75\nIn July 1996, the Home Affairs Committee in their Report on the Possession of Hand-guns76\nsuggested that \"If hand guns were to be banned, compensation might have to be paid to\nowners who were required to surrender their firearms\".77 The Secretary of State for Scotland\nand the Home Secretary, in a joint memorandum of evidence, commented on suggestions for\nchange and particularly on the cost of compensation:78\n34. Most of the suggestions above would lead to a requirement for the disposal of guns which\nwould no longer be able to be held legally. As in 1988, following the prohibitions imposed\nby the Firearms (Amendment) Act of that year, the Government would need to consider a\nscheme for buying in or otherwise compensating the owners of these guns.\n35. The cost is hard to assess, since it would depend to a large extent on exactly what was\nbeing compensated. The estimated number of handguns of one type or another legally held\non a police firearm certificate in Great Britain is in the order of 190,000. Handguns can be\nhigh-value items-top of the range target pistols retail for up to £2,500, or more. Target pistol\nowners may also have ancillary equipment, such as bullet-making machinery, which a\nprohibition on pistols could render redundant. Firearms dealers would also be affected, in\nsome cases severely.\nLater, in October 1996, the Cullen Report also commented on the potential cost of\ncompensating owners of hand guns should their possession be prohibited:79\n9.104 The expropriation of hand guns would give rise to clams for compensation. Mr Paton\nprovided evidence as to their cost. He stated that prices for new self-loading pistols ranged\nfrom £200 to £2,000 or more, with second-hand handguns ranging from £150 to £1,500 or\nmore. The most common price range for both new and second-handguns was from £300 to\n£600. The cost of new revolvers ranged from £200 to £1,000 or more; with second-hand\nranging from £100 to £500 or more. The average range for new and second-hand revolvers\nwas between £150 and £500. By way of comparison, a single shot pistol ranged in price\nbetween £200 and £2,000 or more; and second-hand from £50 upwards. Due to the limited\nmarket for such guns it was not possible for him to estimate an average cost. It is also right\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n74 SI 1992/2823\n75 Home Office Press Notice 30.12.92\n76 1995-96 HC 393-I\n77 ibid, para. 54\n78 1995-96 HC 393-II\n79 The Public Inquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996, Cm 3386\n66\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nto take account of the money invested in accessories such as optical sights, holsters, carrying\nboxes and security cabinets. In his submission Mr Colin Greenwood stated that in Great\nBritain the annual sales of ammunition and related accessories approached £20 m: and that a\nconsiderable number of jobs - such as in clubs, manufacturing and supplying, the gun trade\nand the work of gunsmiths - were dependent on pistol shooting.\nThe Home Secretary's statement of 16 October 1996 on measures which could lead to the\ndestruction of 160,000 hand guns - \"80 per cent of those legally held today\" included the\nundertaking that appropriate compensation would be paid for hand guns legally possessed.80\nUnder clause 10 of the Firearms (Amendment) Bill 1996-97, the Secretary of State may\nmake arrangements for \"the orderly surrender at designated police stations\" of firearms the\npossession of which will become illegal, and clause 11 provides for a scheme of payments\nto individuals in respect of prohibited small firearms surrendered:\n11. The Secretary of State shall, in accordance with a scheme made by\nhim, make payments to persons who surrender firearms to a chief officer\nof police-\n(a) which they had, and were entitled to have in their possession on or\nbefore ]6th October 1996 by virtue of firearm certificates held by\nthem or by virtue of their being registered firearms dealers; or\n(b) which on or before that date they had contracted to acquire and\nwere entitled to have in their possession on and after that date by\nvirtue of such certificates held by them or by virtue of their being\nregistered firearms dealers,\nand their possession of which will become, or has become, unlawful by\nvirtue of section 1 above.\nThe Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill states that the effect on public expenditure of the\ntighter controls on firearms and the prohibition of higher calibre hand guns will depend on\nthe amount of compensation which has to be paid:\nFinancial effects of the Bill\nThe proposals in the Bill provide tighter controls on firearms and\nprohibit higher calibre handguns. Their effect on public expenditure will\ndepend largely upon the total amount of compensation that is paid out to\nfirearm owners and registered dealers. All costs are given at current prices.\nIt is expected that compensation at market value will need to be paid on\nsome 160,000 guns held by individuals and dealers which will become\nprohibited weapons.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n80 HC Deb. 282, c.833\n67\n\n\nIt is estimated that the total amount of compensation to be paid could\nrange between £25 million and £50 million.\nIn addition, there will be administrative costs for storing guns while\nthey are valued, and for handling compensation claims. It is estimated that\nthese will be between £3 million and £5 million.\nCompensation payments are likely to start in April 1997. The bulk of\nthe administrative costs will fall in the financial year 1997/98. Some\nfunding would be necessary in 1996197 to set up the compensation scheme.\nThis would be absorbed within the Home Office Vote.\nThe Home Secretary's statement of 16 October did not, however, suggest that any\ncompensation would be payable to gun clubs unable to comply with new requirements:81\nFew, if any, existing gun clubs will be able to meet\nthose requirements. When the powers become law, we\nshall therefore require any owner of a .22 rimfire handgun\nto hand his gun to the police for safekeeping until he is\nable to find a licensed club that he can join. We shall\nthen provide a period for clubs to improve their security,\nand to be inspected and licensed. Some handgun clubs\nmay never be able to achieve an adequate level of\nsecurity. If so, they will have to close.\nIt remains to be seen whether and to what extent the Sports Council will be able to make\nNational Lottery funding available in these circumstances. The Bill's business compliance\ncost assessment states that the level of costs involved for clubs which choose to become\nlicensed pistol clubs will depend on existing security arrangements and how far they can\ncomply with new requirements: \"These costs cannot currently be quantified\". \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights\nArticle 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights provides that:\nEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his\npossessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public\ninterest and subject to the conditions provided by law and by the general\nprinciples of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of\na State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of\nproperty in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of\ntaxes or other contibutions or penalties. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n81 HC Deb. 282, c.833 \n68\n\n\nThis article is frequently invoked in proceedings brought under the European Convention, but\nthe European Court of Human Rights rarely finds that a violation has taken place. This is not,\nperhaps, surprising in view of the wide range of permissible restrictions set out in the article.\nLuke Clements has suggested that:82\nWhilst the first paragraph [of article 1] delimits the situations in which\ndeprivation of possessions is permitted, the second paragraph almost\namounts to a presumption that some form of control over the enjoyment of\npossessions is inevitable.\nJ.E.S Fawcett has noted that:83\nWhat is surprising is that the Article does not clearly enunciate a right to\ncompensation for the taking of property, a principle which, though\nsometimes honoured in the breach, is recognized in the greater part of the\nworld, including those countries that seek to apply Communist doctrines of\nproperty ownership. It is left to extract, if it is possible, a right to\ncompensation out of the words 'no one shall be deprived of his possessions';\nbut the preparatory work is not helpful here.\nThe issue of the relationship between measures to control firearms and the Bill of Rights 1689\nis considered elsewhere in this Paper.\nAmnesties\nSince the beginning of controls on firearms in 1920, there have been nine amnesties: in 1933,\n1935, 1937, 1946, 1961, 1965, 1968, 1988 and 1996. The authority for the 1988 amnesty was\nexplained by Mr Douglas Hogg on 19 December 1988, and this is a typical arrangement:84\nMr. William Ross: To ask the Secretary of\nState for the Home Department under what powers\nhe acted in offering the recent firearms amnesty.\n Mr. Douglas Hogg: The amnesty had no\nstatutory basis. It amounted to an agreement by\nchief officers of police, with the consent of my\nright hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General,\nnot to bring criminal proceedings for unlawful\npossession against those who surrendered illegally\nheld firearms to the police during the period of the\namnesty.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n82 European Human Rights: Taking a Case under the Convention - Luke Clements 1994 p201\n83 The Application of the European Convention on Human Rights - J.E.S Fawcett 1987 p405-6. The interpretation\nof Article 1 by the European Court is discussed in this book (p405-411) in Luke Clements' book set out above\n(p201-205) and in Francis G. Jacobs and Robin C.A White's book The European Convention on Human Rights\n(2nd edition p246-259) amongst others\n84 HC Deb vol 144, c.138W\n69\n\n\nThe Consultation Paper of 1973 indicated that previous amnesties had been conducted on the\nsame basis, and warned against the dangers of too frequent amnesties:85\n124. This Green Paper has set out the Government's proposals for\ntightening the law on firearms. Legislation is not, however, the only means\nby which the availability of firearms to criminals can be reduced. On seven\noccasions since 1933 there have been firearms amnesties (that is, appeals for\nthe surrender of firearms coupled with assurances that those surrendering\nthem would not be prosecuted for possessing them without a certificate). An\namnesty provides those in illegal possession of firearms with an opportunity\nto dispose of them without fear of prosecution, so reducing the number of\nillegally held firearms in circulation. The practice has been for the Home\nSecretary to consult chief officers of police about the desirability of an\namnesty, and then to ask them not to prosecute for illegal possession persons\nhanding in firearms during the amnesty. Corresponding action is taken in\nScotland. The last amnesty was held in 1968. immediately before the\nprovisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 about shot gun certificates came\ninto operation; over one-third of the firearms handed in then were unwanted\nshot guns.\n125. The figures of firearms handed in during previous amnesties\nsuggest that there are considerable numbers of illegally held firearms which\nwill be handed in when their possessors are given the opportunity to do this\nwithout fear of prosecution. If amnesties were too frequent, the impression\nmight be given that the illegal possession of firearms was not a serious\noffence, and those holding firearms without certificates might be encouraged\nto retain them in the belief that there would always be an opportunity to\nhand them in next time there was an amnesty.\nThe last amnesty ran from 3 to 30 June 1996 and on 23 July 1996 the Home Secretary\nannounced in a written answer that nearly 23,000 firearms, 700,000 rounds of ammunition and\n3,000 other weapons were surrendered to police forces in Great Britain.86 A Home Office\npress notice of the same date revealed that the final figures for different types of weapons\nwere:\nRifles 1,859\nSmooth-bore guns 8,649\nHand guns 4,442\nOther firearms 7,989\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n85 Cmnd 5297, 1973\n86 HC Deb 282, c.172W\n70\n\n\nThe 1988 amnesty lasted for the month of September 1988, and its promotion was to cost\n£500,000.87 A total of 42,725 firearms and 1,511,000 rounds of ammunition were surrendered\nin England and Wales.88 This was considered to compare most favourably with the 1968\nappeal which extended over three months when 25,088 firearms and 795,163 rounds of\nammunition were handed in. Notes to the press notice includes the fact that the substantial\nmajority of guns surrendered were of military origin, dating back to the Great War or World\nWar II. This had produced a high proportion of pistols and revolvers in the total and there\nwas a decline in the proportion of shotguns compared with 1968. In Scotland, 5,177 firearms\nand 221,703 rounds of ammunition were surrendered in 1988 (ibid).\nWeapons surrendered under ammesties are destroyed, except for those of historical\nsignificance which were acquired by museums under special arrangements. None is offered\nfor sale.89\nOn 15 May 1996 Alex Carlile MP asked the Home Secretary what procedures other than a\nnational amnesty exist for members of the public to dispose of firearms that have been owned\nor discovered without a licence. The answer read as follows:90\nWhether to prosecute offences of unlawful possession\nof firearms is a matter for the prosecuting authorities on a\ncase by case basis. But Home Office guidance to the\npolice is that no obstacle should be placed in the way of\nindividuals who wish to hand in unlicensed or unwanted\nguns, even when an amnesty is not running. Our current\nguidance, publicly available from Her Majesty's Stationery\nOffice since 1989 in \"Firearms Law: Guidance to the\npolice\", underlines this advice.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n87 Home Office Press Notice, 31.8.88\n88 24.1.1989; HC Deb. 145, cc.508-514W and Home Office Press Notice, 3.11.88\n89 15.5.96 HC Deb. 277 c.455W\n90 HC Deb. 477, c.455W\n71\n\n\nF. Firearms control and the Bill of Rights 1689\nFrom time to time there have been assertions that the Bill of Rights 168991 may affect\nstatutory attempts at gun control, as contemplated in the present bill.92 This Section seeks\nto explore, in general terms, some of the relevant constitutional issues. The detailed law of\npossession of firearms is dealt with elsewhere in this paper.\nArticle 7\nWhat is commonly described as article 7 of the Bill of Rights is as follows:\n\"Subject's arms -- That the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their\ndefence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law\"\nSchwoerer has neatly summarised the background and legislative history of this provision.93\nIn particular, she noted that the two qualifiers -- \"suitable to their conditions\" and \"as allowed\nby law\" -- were amendments introduced by the House of Lords: \"their effect was to limit the\nright to bear arms to the Protestant upper classes, according to the laws already passed,\" and\nshe concluded that \"in its final form, with the qualifying clauses, the article both reaffirmed\nancient laws in giving men the right to possess arms according to their social and economic\nstanding and declared new law in limiting the right to Protestants.\"94\nBlackstone referred to the article in the general context of civil liberties in English law:95\n5. The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I at present\nmention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition\nand degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the\nsame statute 1 W. & M. st. 2, c. 2, and it is indeed a public allowance under\ndue restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when\nthe sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the\nviolence of oppression.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n91 Sometimes dated 1688. There is a similar provision, although not in the positive terms of the English provision,\nin the Scottish Claim of Right 1689: Stair Encyclopaedia, vol 10 para 1502. Doubt has been expressed as to the\napplication of the Bill of Rights to Northern Ireland; see G Lock, \"The 1689 Bill of Rights\", (1989) XXXVII\nPolitical Studies 540, 557-8. The application of international law, such as the European Convention on Human\nRights, is not considered here (on which see, for example, Baroness Chalker's written answer, HL Deb vol 571\nc.WA1, 1.4.96) \n92 For example, Mr Richard Munday, who submitted evidence to the Cullen Tribunal and the recent Home Affairs\nCommittee inquiry on hand guns, has analysed the relevant provisions in their historical and contemporary context.\nThis has apparently formed the basis of some of the arguments currently being put to Ministers and Members \n93 L Schwoerer, The declaration of rights 1689, 1981, pp74-8\n94 p.78\n95 W Blackstone, Commentaries, 21st ed, 1844 (by J Hargrave), pp143-4\n72\n\n\n  In these several articles consist the rights, or, as they are frequently termed,\nthe liberties of Englishmen: liberties, more generally talked of than\nthoroughly understood; and yet highly necessary to be perfectly known and\nconsidered by every man of rank or property, lest his ignorance of the points\nwhereon they are founded should hurry him into faction and licentiousness\non the one hand, or a pusillanimous indifference and criminal submission on\nthe other. And we have seen that these rights consist, primarily, in the free\nenjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property.\nSo long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every\nspecies of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one\nor other of these rights, having no other object upon which it can possibly\nbe employed. To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the\nconstitution of parliament be supported its full vigour; and limits, certainly\nknown, be set to the royal prerogative. And lastly, to vindicate these rights,\nwhen actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in\nthe first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the\ncourts of law; next, to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for\nredress of grievances; and, lastly, to the right of having and using arms for\nself-preservation and defence. And all these rights and liberties it is our\nbirthright to enjoy entire; unless where the laws of our country have laid\nthem under necessary restraints-restraints in themselves so gentle and\nmoderate, as will appear upon farther inquiry, that no man of sense or\nprobity would wish to see them slackened. For all of us have it in our\nchoice to do everything that a good man would desire to do; and are\nrestrained from nothing, but what would be pernicious either to ourselves or\nour fellow-citizens.\nThe 1689 article has been cited inside and outwith Parliament at various times. For example,\nduring debates on what became the Seizure of Arms Act 181996, it was considered in some\ndetail. A protest against the bill in the Lords Journal cited both article 7 and Blackstone in\ndefence of British subjects' rights to bear arms for their defence.97 During the Commons\ncommittee stage, Canning, for the government, accepted the relevance of article 7, but\nemphasised the qualifications in the provision:98\nIt was most true, as had been laid down, that\nall subjects were entitled by the Bill of Rights to\nhave arms, but with one small qualification, which\nhe mentioned not in praise of, or with a view to\nestablish the qualifications, but as showing that at\nthe very time when our ancestors laid down the\nprinciple they contemplated the exception. Those\nwho had cited the Bill of Rights had uniformly\nomitted the important words- \"All subjects being\nProtestants have a right so to be armed.\" How had\nit happened that in all the discussions for the last\nthree weeks, in all the public addresses for the last\nthree months, that clause had been carefully\nexcluded? What was to be inferred from those\nwords? - That the Papists ought now to be\ndisarmed? Certainly not: he only brought them\nforward to illustrate the position, that this general\nright, like every other, was subject to qualification;\nand nothing could more satisfactorily prove its\nsubjectness to qualification than the fact, that at the\nvery moment the right was conferred it was actually\nqualified. Though the current of opinion was at\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n96 Some sources cite this as 1820\n97 Parl Deb vol 41 c754, 6.12.1819 (HL)\n98 cc. 1142-3, 14.12.1819\n73\n\n\npresent against such an exception of the Catholics\nhe was not sure whether, by any subsequent law, it\nhad been repealed; but supposing it remained on\nthe Statute-book, that clause would exclude from\nthe possession of arms no small portion of the\ninhabitants in some of the disturbed districts.\nWould he then exempt the professors of the\nCatholic religion from the right of having arms for\nself-defence? No; he had always argued in a\ncontrary direction; but the Bill of Rights, correctly\nquoted and properly construed, brought him to the\nprovision of the bill on the table, which, in fact,\nrecognised the general right of the subject to have\narms, but qualified that right in such a manner as\nthe necessity of the case required. As the Papists\nat the Revolution, were armed against the existing\ngovernment, and were excepted in the Bill of\nRights, so the act before the House excepted the\ndisaffected in the disturbed districts who were in\narms against the law and authorities of the land. \nHe appealed, therefore, to the Bill of Rights in\ndefence of the step he now called upon the House\nto take; and he contended that it would only be to\ncarry into effect the very doctrines our forefathers\nhad shown that they admitted. In the spirit of the\nBill of Rights, he called upon the legislature to\ninterpose to suspend a right, and take away arms\nthat could not be held without danger to the\ntranquillity of the state. \nGreenwood's 1972 study, Firearms control, analysed the application of the 1689 provision as\npart of a general history of firearms regulation.99 He noted that \"the bill did not seek to\ndisarm Catholics, but merely to ensure that discrimination against Protestants in the matter\nof keeping arms for their defence should cease\", and considered the legal context of the\nprovision: \"As with most of the great constitutional milestones, the Bill of Rights must be\ncarefully considered against the conditions of the times.\"100 He cited the extract from\nBlackstone, and concluded:101\nBlackstone's Commentaries were then, and indeed still are, regarded as the\ndefinitive statement of the Common Law. In matters relating to Common\nLaw they are still quoted with authority in the highest courts. His study of\nthe Common Law and the Constitution as it relates to the right to have arms\nmust, therefore, be accepted as indeed it was by later English governments-\nas an accurate assessment of the state of the law at the time of writing. The\nright to keep arms appears to have persisted until the twentieth century and\nthe effect of the Constitution on twentieth-century laws and practice is a\nmatter for discussion under that heading. Certainly the right was jealously\npreserved by parliament during the nineteenth century.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n99 C Greenwood, Firearms control: a study of armed crime and firearms control in England and Wales, 1972, pp11-\n5. The author is a firearms consultant and was a special adviser to the Home Affairs Committee in its recent\ninquiry on the possession of handguns: see his memorandum (esp paras 1-9), 5th report, vol II, HC 393-II, 1995-\n96, pp107ff\n100 p.11\n101 pp13-4\n74\n\n\nIn his evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, he summarised his argument in the following\nterms:102\n12. Early English legislation relating to firearms was concerned only with the duty of the\ncitizen to arm himself for the defence of the realm and for the maintenance of order. Early\nlegislation restricting the use of it was concerned only with the maintenance of compulsory\npractice with the longbow or with the preservation of game. There was a clear and recognised\nright, as well as a duty for the subject to have arms for his own protection and to discharge\nhis duty to the state, though those arms would not necessarily have been firearms.\n13. The Bill of Rights of 1688 made it perfectly clear that Parliament considered that\nthere was a right for citizens to have arms (page 11) and by the mid 18th century the Common\nLaw was very clear in recognising a Constitutional right to have arms which Parliament had\nno authority to breach in general terms (page 12). In the early 19th century, perceived dangers\nof major disorder resulted in the \"Six Acts\" amongst which was the Seizure of Arms Act 1820\nwhich appeared to abrogate the right to keep arms. Debates in Parliament (pages 14 and 15)\nmade it clear that the Government accepted that there was indeed a right to keep arms but\ntheir view was that the Constitution allowed for qualification of that right for a limited period\nand in specified area. The Seizure of Arms Act automatically lapsed after two years and was\napplied only to specified areas of the country. Until the start of the 20th century, therefore,\nthe right to keep arms was vigorously upheld by Parliament and all attempts at legislation to\nrestrict arms generally or firearms in particular failed completely.\nIn R v Dewhurst (1820) 1St Tr NS 529 (a criminal case of unlawful assembly etc), Bayley\nJ, summing up, said, inter alia:103 \nOn the subject of carrying arms the learned\njudge said: Gentlemen, I forgot to observe to you\non the subject of carrying arms that I do not agree\nwith the counsel on the part of the defendants that\npersons have a right to carry arms in the way in\nwhich those arms are described to have been\ncarried. Mr. Justice Blackstone lays down the right\nof the subject to carry arms as\n\"having arms for their defence, suitable to their\ncondition and degree, and such as are allowed by\nlaw. Which is also declared by the same statute 1\nWilliam and Mary, sess. 2. c.2; and it is indeed a\npublic allowance under due restrictions of the\nnatural right of resistance and self-preservation,\nwhen the sanctions of society and laws are found\ninsufficient to restrain the violence of\noppression.\"(a)\nGentlemen, he refers to the Bill of Rights.\nYou will see what the Bill of Rights says upon that\nsubject. It provides that,\n\"The subjects which are Protestants may have arms\nfor their defence suitable to their conditions, and as\nallowed by law.\"(b)\nBut are arms suitable to the condition of people\nin the ordinary class of life, and are they allowed\nby law? A man has a clear right to arms to protect\nhimself when he is going singly or in a small party\nupon the road where he is travelling or going for\nthe ordinary purposes of business, But I have no\ndifficulty in saying you have no right to carry arms\nto a public meeting, if the number of arms which\nare so carried are calculated to produce terror and\nalarm; and if you could be at liberty to carry arms\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n102 op cit, p108. A memorandum by Mr Michael Yardley makes a similar claim for the 1689 provision: \"The Bill\nof Rights of 1689 confirmed a constitutional right to keep and bear arms .... The interesting point is that the right\nto keep arms without impediment -- which was enshrined in common law until the late Victorian era -- is not a\nColonial invention\" (p143). The last point is a reference to the \"right to bear arms\" provision of the Second\nAmendment to the US Constitution \n103 601-2. See also, for example, R v Smith [1914] II IR 190, and cases cited therein\n75\n\n\nupon an expectation that by possibility there might\nbe an attack at the place, that would be an excuse\nfor carrying arms in every instance when you went\nto a public meeting.(a) Therefore, I have no\ndifficulty in saying persons are not warranted in\ncarrying arms to a public meeting, if they are\ncalculated to create terror and alarm. You have no\nright to suspect there will be an illegal attack on\nyou. Therefore, you are not at liberty to carry arms\nwith you.\nArticle 12\nIt has also been suggested that the Bill of Rights is relevant to any scheme of surrender of\nfirearms, including compensation arrangements, as in clauses 10 and 11 of the current bill.\nThe relevant provision which proponents of this argument may have in mind may be article\n12:\n\"Grants of forfeitures -- That all grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of\nparticular persons before conviction are illegal and void.\"\nLock has described the historical context of this provision:104\nThis Article related to a system which worked as follows: if somebody was being tried for\ntreason (for example), it was the law that his possessions would be forfeit to the Crown if he\nwere convicted. Courtiers, or other well-placed individuals, would secure a promise from the\nCrown that, in the event of a conviction, they would be given the traitor's property.\nHalsbury's Laws sets out the general position of the right to property in English law:105\n833. Right to property. The right not to be deprived of property without due\nprocess of law(1) originated in Magna Carta(2) and has been restated and\namplified subsequently.(3) The right does not exclude expropriation for\npublic purposes such as by nationalisation or compulsory purchase order(4),\nbut an intention on the part of the legislature to deprive a person of his\nproperty without compensation is not to be imputed unless it is stated in\nexpress terms.(5) The right to property is protected by remedies in equity\nand tort. The right includes a right to peaceful enjoyment of property(6),\nwhich is similarly protected, but is subjected to compliance with legal\nrequirements as to user(7) and avoidance of injury to others and their\nproperty.(8)\nThe right may be regarded as embracing the principle of no taxation\nwithout representation(9); this principle, however, in view of the application\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n104 op cit p.560 fn 102\n105 vol 8, para 833.

This is considered further below.\nThe 'constitutional' status of the Bill of Rights 1689\nWhile, in the unwritten/uncodified UK constitution, there are no unambiguously constitutional\n'higher' laws as such107, statutes such as the Bill of Rights 1689108 are generally regarded as\nbeing 'core' constitutional laws which deserve and receive particular respect and scrutiny by\nthe three branches of government. For example it is argued that legislators should take care\nwhen passing laws which do or could conflict with such 'constitutional' provisions, and the\ncourts will generally be unwilling to accept that the provisions of such legislation has been\noverridden by later statutes except in clear language. See, for example, Lord Wilberforce,\nextra-judicially:109\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n106 E.g. A-G v De Keyser's Royal Hotel [1920] AC 508, HL; Burmah Oil v LA 1964 SC (HL) 117, [1965] AC 75\n107 On which see Research Paper 96/82, 18.7.96, The constitution: principles and development, esp chaps III, V\nand VI\n108 or the Union legislation of 1707 and 1800, the Parliaments Acts 1911 and 1949 and the European Communities\nAct 1972 for example\n109 Privileges Committee, report on the petition of the Irish peers, HL 53, 1966-67, p73. See also Re Parliamentary\nPrivilege Act 1770 [1958] 2 All ER 329, PC, esp Viscount Simonds at 333: \"The conclusion that this privilege,\nsolemnly reasserted in the Bill of Rights, was within a few years abrogated or at least vitally impaired cannot\n77\n\n\nIn strict law there may be no difference in status... as between one Act of Parliament and\nanother, but I confess to some reluctance in holding that an Act of such constitutional\nsignificance as the Union with Ireland Act is subject to the doctrine of implied repeal or of\nobsolescence.\nThis has not prevented later express or implied repeal or amendment of supposed\n'untouchable' constitutional statutory provisions, such as that in the Bill of Rights itself\nconcerning the succession to the throne, declared to be a provision which \"shall stand remain\nand be the law of this realm for ever..\", which was altered a dozen years later by the Act of\nSettlement 1700.\nIn the civil liberties context Feldman has related the provisions of the Bill of Rights to modern\ncircumstances:\nOver time, others have benefited from the ethos of government produced by\nMagna Carta and the Bill of Rights. However, to say that they offer\neffective protection to rights ignores the reality of modern and perhaps pre-\nmodern, legislation and administration. The doctrine of parliamentary\nsupremacy, which Dicey advanced as a way of ensuring continuing\ndemocratic accountability for legislation, left Parliament with the more or\nless untrammelled power to restrict or abrogate rights and freedoms, as well\nprotect them. Magna Carta and the 1689 Bill of Rights can be repealed or\namended by implication by statutes, without even the need for express\nwords. Except in relation to the protection of property against unauthorized\ntaxation(94), the Bill of Rights has been restrictively interpreted, for example\ndenying a remedy to prisoners under the clause forbidding cruel and unusual\npunishment unless the punishment could be shown to be both cruel and\nunusual.(95)\n94 Congreve v. Home Office [1976] QB 629\n95 Williams v. Home Office (No.2) [1981] 1 All ER 1211, below, ch. 6, s. 3(4)\nNevertheless the Bill of Rights remains an operative statute, as the history of the\nParliamentary privilege of free speech demonstrates.110 In Bowles v Bank of England [1913]\n1 Ch 57 at 84-5, (no taxation other than by Act of Parliament, ie not by prerogative or\nresolution of a House of Parliament), Parker J said that \"the Bill of Rights still remains\nunrepealed, and no practice or custom, however prolonged, or however acquiesced in on the\npart of the subject, can be relied on by the Crown as justifying any infringement of its\nprovisions.\"111 Some of the articles are more 'loosely' phrased than others, a factor in their\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \nlightly be reached\"\n110 See Research Paper 96/61, 16.5.96, Defamation Bill [HL], Bill 127 of 1995-96: Parliamentary privilege. It is\nunderstood, that shooters have cited Madam Speaker's statement on 21 July 1993 (on the privilege aspects of Lord\nRees-Moggs legal challenge to the Maastricht legislation) in support: HC Deb vol 229 cc 353-4\n111 See also Congreve v Home Office [1976] 1 All ER at 710 (Lord Denning MR)\n78\n\n\npotential justiciability.112 Lock claimed that the set of articles \" was in effect a programme\nf o r f u t u r e\nlegislation\":113\nIt was never intended that the Articles should stand on their own as substantive law but rather\nthat Parliament should return to these topics, elaborate on the summary texts and work them\nup into full-scale statutes. This is made clear in the Commons Journal:\nAnd towards the making a more firm and perfect Settlement of the said Religion, Laws and Liberties;\nand for Remedy of several Defects and Inconveniences; it is proposed and advised by the said\nCommons, that there be Provision, by new Laws, made in such manner, and with such Limitations,\nas, by the wisdom and Justice of Parliament, shall be considered and ordained in the Particulars, and\nto the Purposes, following...\nAt this point in the Journal a list is given of the headings to be covered by the programme.\nThe Declaration of Rights was drawn up in a hurry and was confined to topics on which the\nCommons and Lords could agree. The original draft produced by the Commons' Committee\nincluded 28 heads but of these only 11 were included among the 13 appearing in the final\nversion. The remainder had to be sacrificed in the interests of speed and compromise. The\nidea of dealing with new rights, as opposed to stating existing rights, had to go by the board\nso that, for example, the granting of security of tenure to the higher judiciary had to be left\nfor a later occasion.\nHe believed that \"whatever William's intentions may have been, [i.e. in the situation which\narose in 1689] the basic text of the Articles has been regarded as having statutory force, but\nthere can be a difficulty in the application to modern conditions of provisions enacted in very\nbrief terms three centuries ago.\"114\nIf the question of the application of the provision in the Bill of Rights to proposed or actual\nmeasures of firearms control ever arose before the courts, doubtless the answer could hinge,\nto some extent, on the construction of the qualifying phrases in article 7 \"for their defence\",\n\"suitable to their conditions\" and \"as allowed by law\"; the applicability, if any, of the prima\nfacie religious discrimination provision in modern circumstances,115 and the historical-legal\ncontext of the relevant legislation and caselaw, such as the existence, if at all, of some legal\n'right' to possess firearms in light of the regulatory legislation of this century. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n112 It may be noted that Wade & Bradley's standard constitutional law text cites every article -- \"principal provisions\n(known as 'articles'), many of which are still in force as part of English law\" -- except article 7: Constitutional\nand administrative law, 11th ed (by Bradley and Ewing), 1993 , pp14-5. Lock lists article 7 as one of those\ndealing with \"issues that are no longer a problem\", op cit, p560\n113 Lock, op cit, pp541-2\n114 p.542\n115 For example, would it be regarded in the same light as the religious (dis)qualifications for the succession?\n79\n\n\nG. Northern Ireland\nFirearm control in Northern Ireland is governed by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order\n1981, as amended.116 A review of the legislation announced on 23.11.95 is in progress to take\naccount of developments in firearms technology and design and the growth in recreational and\nsporting use of firearms in the consideration of legislation \"largely unchanged since the\n1960's\".\nControls in Northern Ireland are broadly similar to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.\nOn 1 November 1996, Sir John Wheeler announced a PQ on the law on hand guns in\nNorthern Ireland:117\nMr. Worthington: To ask the Secretary of State\nfor Northern Ireland if he will list the difference in\nrespect of guidelines relating to the legal possession\nof handguns in (a) Northern Ireland and (b) Great\nBritain.\nSir John Wheeler: Under the Firearms (Northern\nIreland) Order, 1981, the Chief Constable is\nresponsible for the administration of firearms\nlicensing. His policy in relation to sporting\nhandguns which was agreed with the Secretary of\nState is that a person cannot acquire a handgun\nunless he is able to show good reason for acquiring\nsuch a firearm and he has been a member of a\nregistered firearms club for a minimum of 12\nmonths; the application is supported by the\nsecretary of the firearms club; and the police are\ncontent that he is a suitable person to hold such a\nweapon. In addition, the Chief Constable may\napprove the issue of a handgun where a person's\nlife is believed to be under a serious and specific\nterrorist threat. In these circumstances the Chief\nConstable must satisfy himself that the individual is\nin all regards suitable to hold such a firearm and\nthat his possession of the firearm does not pose a\nthreat to the wider public safety.\nThe main difference is perhaps that the stricter controls in Great Britain over rifles, pistols\nand short-barrelled shotguns etc. are applied in Northern Ireland to shotguns and air weapons.\nIn particular the onus is on the applicant to show that s/he has good reason to possess a\nfirearm, rather than on the police to show that s/he does not . The distinction has developed\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n116 SI 1981/155\n117 HC Deb 284, c.281W\n80\n\n\nRecent Research Papers on related subjects include:\n \n96/99 The Crime (Sentences) Bill [Bill 3 of 1996-97] 01.11.96 \n96/100 The Crime (Sentences) Bill and the Crime and 31.10.96\nPunishment (Scotland) Bill: provisions for mentally\ndisordered offenders\n96/15 Controls on Knives and other Offensive Weapons 25.01.96\n95/29 Investigating and reviewing possible miscarriages of 03.03.95\njustice - The Criminal Appeal Bill [Bill 57 of 1994/95] \n\n\n\n"

Landfill is by far the most common means of waste disposal in the UK, but the\nGovernment's recent sustainable waste management strategy Making Waste Work undertook\nto reduce the amount of waste being disposed of in this way. The Chancellor first announced\nplans for a landfill levy in his 1994 Budget speech, though legislation to introduce the tax was\nnot brought forward until 1996, following a long consultation process. The tax is set at two\nrates: £7 per tonne for active wastes and £2 per tonne for inert wastes. This paper outlines\nthe practice of landfilling waste, considers the justification for a tax and its likely effects, and\nmentions landfill practices abroad. \nPatsy Hughes Antony Seely\nScience & Environment Section Business & Transport Section\nGraham Vidler\nSocial & General Statistics Section \nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

For so-called 'controlled' wastes,\nthe same figures are over 70% landfilled and 20% reused or recycled. Controls on landfill\npractice are tighter today than in the past but environmental problems can still arise,\nparticularly in the generation of gas from landfill sites. In its sustainable development and\nwaste management strategies the Government has undertaken to swing the balance away from\nlandfill in favour of reuse, recycling and energy recovery from waste. The amount of waste\ngoing to incineration, with energy recovery, is set to rise for various reasons, and energy from\nlandfill gas has also been included in the Non Fossil Fuel Obligations. The packaging waste\nstream should start to decline as a result of the EU Packaging Directive which will soon be\nimplemented in the UK. \nOn 1 October 1996 a new tax on waste disposal in landfill sites came into effect, following\na two year consultation process. The tax is levied per tonne of waste at two rates: £2 per\ntonne for specified inactive wastes (such as glass); £7 per tonne for active wastes which are\ncapable of degrading (such as paper). Around 1,400 businesses will pay the tax, though\nlandfill site operators can mitigate its effects by contributing to an environmental trust. The\ntax is expected to raise about £450 million per year, and the Government proposes to use\nthese receipts to help fund a cut in the main rate of National Insurance Contributions for\nemployers (from 10.2% to 10% from 6 April 1997).\nThe decision to impose a landfill tax and for this to be weight-based has been welcomed by\nenvironmental organisations, although some have called for the levy to be set at a far higher\nrate, and to cover all aspects of waste disposal, including incineration. Nevertheless, the\ngeneral view is that the advantages of landfill over incineration are set to decline anyway and\nthat while the levy will not have a significant effect on the amount of waste going to landfill\nin the short term, it may in the longer term. Similarly, although even a higher levy would\nprobably do little to encourage recycling at present, again in the longer term this might\nchange. A system of environmental trusts has been established to fund research into\nrestoration of landfill sites, and clean-ups where liability is unclear. There have been fears\nthat the levy may cause an increase in the illegal dumping of waste, or fly-tipping, and also\nthat it may place burdens on local authority budgets; such issues are discussed in this paper. \nThe UK is not alone in introducing a landfill levy, nor in relying heavily on landfill as a\ndisposal route. The EU's proposed Landfill Directive has just been rejected by the European\nParliament, and the Commission is about to table new proposals. In general, other Member\nStates favour tighter controls on landfill than the UK, and are seeking pretreatment of wastes\ngoing to landfill, and restrictions on co-disposal sites (where different types of waste are\nlandfilled together). The UK's geology favours landfill to a greater extent than other countries,\nand we have long experience of operating co-disposal sites; the Government has undertaken\nto oppose any moves to require pretreatment for all wastes going to landfill.\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nII Landfill\nA. Waste management strategy in the UK\n1. The shifting scene\nLandfill has long been the mainstay of British waste management practice and far outstrips\nany other disposal method. For example, in the UK 90% of household waste is sent to\nlandfill, with only 5% of household waste being recycled and another 5% being incinerated.\nThe Government's recent sustainable waste management strategy Making Waste Work1\nmentions that \"landfill has served mankind for much longer than any alternative disposal\noption.\" \nIn the UK this is largely because our geology is more favourable towards landfill than that,\nfor instance, of other European countries. Generally, a clay rather than fissured or permeable\nbedrock means that less money needs to be spent on engineering a landfill site, because there\nis less danger of water carrying pollutants downwards or of liquid pollutants escaping and\nseeping into water resources including valuable groundwaters or surface waters.2 So landfill\nhas been a cheap waste disposal option in the UK. Since waste disposal is carried out largely\nby the private sector, such factors have favoured the continued use of landfill in the UK. Yet\nin Making Waste Work3 the Government states that its primary waste management targets are\nto:4\n• reduce the proportion of controlled waste going to landfill from 70%\nto 60% by 2005\n• recover [includes incinerating] value from 40% of municipal waste by\n2005\n• set a target for the reduction of waste by the end of 1998.\nThis is because while over the years the engineering standards of landfill practice have\nincreased markedly it can still be argued that the full environmental costs of landfilling waste\nare not reflected in the relatively cheap price of landfill as a disposal option. In the first of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 Department of the Environment (DoE)/Welsh Office, Making waste work: a strategy for sustainable waste\nmanagement in England and Wales, Cm 3040 December 1995 p.62\n2 DoE, UK National Environmental Health Action Plan, Cm 3323 July 1996\n3 Cm 3040 December 1995 pp 8-9\n4 Secondary targets include easily accessible recycling facilities for 80% of households by the year 2000; local\nauthorities have been set a target of recycling 25% of household waste by the year 2000.\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nits This Common Inheritance series of White Papers on the environment, the Government\nundertook to apply the 'precautionary principle' to environmental policy:5\n\"Where there are significant risks of damage to the environment, the Government will\nbe prepared to take precautionary action to limit the use of potentially dangerous\nmaterials, or the spread of potentially dangerous pollutants, even where scientific\nknowledge is not conclusive, if the balance of likely costs and benefits justifies it.\"\nThe discrepancy between the environmental costs and the price of landfill becomes more\nmarked when the principles of sustainable development are applied. Sustainable development\nentails conserving scarce resources, and minimising damage to the environment6. Void space\nfor landfill is a finite resource, and while technical standards of landfill sites have improved,\nthere is still always the possibility of environmental damage occurring (see page 11 onwards).\nThe Government Panel on Sustainable Development in its second report7 continued to\nadvocate a move towards the use of taxes on resources including energy rather than labour\nand income, and welcomed the (then proposed) landfill tax. In its 1994 sustainable\ndevelopment strategy produced in the wake of the Rio Earth Summit the Government\nhighlighted the unsustainability of current waste management practices:8\n\"Large quantities of waste arise as an undesirable by-product of modern production,\npackaging and consumption, with threats to soil, air and water quality if the waste is\nnot properly managed. The aim must be to minimise the amount of waste produced\nand to make best use of the waste which is produced. In this way, loss of valuable\nraw materials and the land which is required for disposal can both be minimised. \n...There is a hierarchy of waste management options:\n• REDUCTION\n• REUSE\n• RECOVERY (INCLUDING RECYCLING AND\nENERGY RECOVERY)\n• DISPOSAL WITHOUT ENERGY RECOVERY BY\nINCINERATION OR LANDFILL\nCurrent waste management practice is tilted too far towards the last option. However,\ntruly sustainable choices are complex...\"\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 DoE, This Common Inheritance - Britain's environmental strategy, Cm 1200 September 1990 p.11\n6 see Sustainable development: Agenda 21 and Earth Summit II, Library Research Paper 96/87, 16 August 1996\n7 DoE, British Government Panel on Sustainable Development Second Report, January 1996\n8 Cm 2426 January 1994 p.14\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nIn 1993 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) published its seventeenth\nreport - Incineration of Waste9 - which called for an increase in incineration, noting that the\n\"emissions from a well operated incineration plant complying with the new HMIP10 standards\nare most unlikely to cause any health effects.\" The RCEP lamented the UK's reliance on\nlandfill, particularly because of its contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. Energy from\nwaste has now been included in the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligations (see page 15) but bands\ninclude both incineration and the use of landfill gas so it is difficult to tell how this will affect\nthe balance between the two practices. \nFinally, it is worth noting that the packaging waste stream should start to decline as a result\nof EC Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, which should have been\nimplemented in Member States by 30 June 1996. By 30 June 2001, 50-65% by weight of\npackaging waste will have to be recovered (recovery includes incineration for energy) and 25-\n45% will have to be recycled, with at least 15% by weight of each packaging material being\nrecycled. In the UK, a comprehensive consultation with industry has resulted in the decision\nto apply a shared legal obligation to all large businesses (which manufacture, fill, sell or\nsupply packaging, and which use over 50 tonnes of packaging a year) no matter where they\nlie in the packaging chain. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste)\nRegulations: A Consultation Paper11 was open for consultation until 9 September; the\nenvironmental agencies will police the scheme, and final implementing Regulations should\nbe laid in November 1996. \n2. The UK waste management regime\nThe UK's waste management system operates under Part II of the Environmental Protection\nAct 1990 (EPA) as amended by the Environment Act 1995. The EPA had strengthened and\nlargely superseded the waste management licensing system which had been operating under\nthe Control of Pollution Act 1974 (CoPA) and introduced the concept of 'duty of care' of\nwaste, prohibiting its unauthorised or harmful deposit, treatment or disposal. \nAnyone in control of waste must prevent the escape of the waste from their control, and must\npass the waste on only to an authorised person. In addition, anyone wishing to operate\ndisposal, storage or treatment facilities for controlled waste, whether or not destined for\nrecycling or disposal, requires a waste disposal or management licence from a waste disposal\nor regulation authority, although exempted activities exist. Breaching any conditions attached\nto such a licence is an offence. Under the EPA, the waste regulation authorities (WRAs)\nwere generally the local authorities, who were thereby able to ensure that waste disposal\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n9 Cm 2181 May 1993\n10 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution, now part of the Environment Agency\n11 Department of the Environment 1996 dep/3 3683\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\ncompanies disposed of waste properly. The waste disposal companies were either private\nfirms to whom work was contracted out (particularly in the industrial and commercial waste\nfields) or were local authority waste disposal companies set up at arms length. \nThe Environment Act 1995 transferred waste regulation powers to the newly created\nenvironment agencies12 which are intended to provide a 'one stop shop' approach to\nenvironmental protection and regulation and incorporate the former National Rivers Authority\n(NRA) and HMIP, plus the waste regulation powers of local authorities. This should provide\na national integrated approach to pollution control. For example, consider a landfill site\noperating in England. The NRA, which used to grant consents to discharge pollution into\nwater courses, would have set licence conditions to prevent water carrying away contaminants\nfrom the landfill site. As well as this, the local authority, acting as the waste regulation\nauthority, would have issued a waste management licence for the site to be operated. The\nwaste regulation authority could also impose licence conditions to prevent landfill sites from\ncausing serious problems. Under the 1995 Act the environment agencies will issue\nenvironmental licences which will cover all environmental aspects of running a landfill site.\nOf course the duty of care concept means that the illegal dumping of waste, or fly-tipping,\nis an offence, and if any waste is deposited on land in contravention of the duty of care\nprovisions, the environment agencies may take steps necessary to remove or reduce the effect\nof the waste, if this is necessary to prevent pollution or damage to health. In addition, the\nControl of Pollution (Amendment) Act 1989 and Regulations made under it allow the\nregulatory authorities (now the environment agencies) to stop and investigate a vehicle\ncarrying waste, if they have reasonable grounds to believe that it has been used for the illegal\ndisposal of waste. \n3. Wastes arising and disposal routes\n \n'Controlled waste' (the term arises because the waste is in effect 'controlled' by the provisions\nof the 1990 EPA and duty of care) includes household, industrial and commercial waste,\nsewage sludge and dredged spoils. The main exemptions from the definition of controlled\nwaste are agricultural, mine and quarry wastes, and most radioactive waste13. \nControlled waste also includes 'special waste', which is the most dangerous controlled waste\nand thus subject to extra controls. These now include the need for prior notification to the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12 The Environment Agency in England and Wales and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. See\nThe Environment Bill (HL) (Bill 85 1994/95), Library Research Paper 95/50, 12 April 1995\n13 Controlled Waste Regulations SI 1992/588\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nEnvironmental Agency of all consignments, which are then registered on a national database.\nThe mixing of different categories of special waste, and of special and non-special wastes is\nprohibited. 'Special waste' is defined by Regulations which implemented EC Directive 91/689\non hazardous waste, and household waste is exempted from being special waste14. \nData on the amount of wastes produced and their management are scarce in the UK, as in\nmuch of the rest of Europe. The sole regular source of waste data for England and Wales is\nthe annual survey of former waste disposal authorities undertaken by the Chartered Institute\nof Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). In recent years, however, the response rates\nfrom authorities have been so low that its figures cannot be used to produce national\nestimates15.\nThe Department of the Environment has published details of its proposals for improving the\nquality of waste management data in future years16, but for the moment is reliant on data\nestimated from a number of surveys undertaken in 1990 and in the latter part of the 1980s.\nThese surveys suggest that over 400 million tonnes of waste are produced in the UK each\nyear, of which around 250 million tonnes is controlled waste. \nTable 1 (overleaf) summarises the DoE's estimates of wastes arising and their disposal routes.\nThese figures suggest that, in 1990, some 125 million tonnes of controlled waste went to\nlandfill in the UK. Around 90% of household waste and 72% of all controlled waste goes\nto landfill. Only 5% of household waste and 20% of all controlled waste is recycled or re-\nused.\nEvidence from Scotland, where reliable surveys of local authority waste management are\ncarried out annually, suggests that the predominance of landfilling has not declined\nsignificantly since 1990. In 1990, Scottish local authorities disposed of around 9.7 million\ntonnes of controlled waste to landfill, which represented 95% of total controlled waste\nretained for disposal. In 1992, they landfilled some 12.2 million tonnes, around 90% of the\ntotal.17\nSomewhat more reliable figures are available on the generation and disposal of special wastes,\nprincipally because the regulation of such waste has required waste regulation authorities\n(now the environment agencies), to monitor its movement. In 1993/94, special waste arisings\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 Special Waste Regulations SI 1996/972\n15 For example, only 57% of authorities responded in 1994-95: CIPFA Waste Disposal Statistics 1994-95\nActuals p.2\n16 DoE, Environment information strategy review - report of the review of waste management information 1995\n17 Scottish Office, Statistical Bulletin Environment Series ENV/1995/2 Waste Collection, Disposal and\nRegulation Statistics 1992\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nin the UK totalled slightly over 2 million tonnes. Of the 1.9 million tonnes retained for\ndisposal by WRAs in England and Wales, slightly less than half, 0.9 million tonnes, went to\nco-disposal (see page 17) landfill sites.

It is inexpensive;\nsuitable for a wide range of wastes; there is a large capacity remaining in some areas; landfill\ngas is a clean source of fuel for heat and power generation; restored land provides valuable\nspace for wildlife and leisure activities; and well designed landfills can be unobtrusive.\nHowever, it noted that all landfills need careful management to ensure that their potential for\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n18 DoE, Digest of Environmental Statistics (18) 1996 Table 7.4(b)\n19 Cm 3040 December 1995 p.62\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\npollution is minimised, and pointed out the potential disadvantages of landfill:\n• versatility and convenience of landfill make it less attractive for waste\nproducers to be innovative in the way in which they deal with their\nwastes\n• however well engineered, there is a finite risk of contamination from\noperational landfill sites;\n• landfill gas can pose significant risks including release of methane,\nan important greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere;\n• after landfilling, the land may retain some contamination and so be\nunsuitable for some uses;\n• noise, odour and unsightliness, and vehicle movements, may cause\nnuisance, in common with all waste disposal and recovery activities,\nand;\n• energy recovery from landfill is less efficient than some other\ndisposal options such as incineration.\n1. Landfill gas\nAccording to 1991 DoE guidance:20\n\"An increasing number of incidents and growing public concern have focused\nattention on the fate of the end-products of waste degradation in landfill sites and their\neffects on the environment. One major area of concern is the evolution of landfill gas\nwhich, when inadequately controlled, has led to explosions, fires, dangerous gas\nconcentrations in and around houses, odour nuisance and vegetation dieback.\" \nLandfill gas arises through the breakdown of biodegradable wastes inside a landfill.\nBiodegradable wastes include paper, wood and animal and vegetable matter, and as microbes\nbreak these materials down, usually in conditions of little oxygen, they produce a mixture of\ngases comprising mostly carbon dioxide (around 35%) and methane (around 65%). The gas\ngiven off, or evolved, through microbial activity may mix with other gases in the landfill,\nperhaps giving rise to odours. It also comes out of the site moist and warm21 so it needs to\nbe treated before it can be burnt, for instance, and it is more likely to act as a corrosive. It\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n20 DoE, Landfill Gas 2nd edition, Waste management paper No.27 1991 p.13\n21 DoE/Welsh Office, Renewable Energy:Planning Policy Guidance Note 22: Annex on using landfill gas,\nOctober 1994\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\ncan travel through and away from the site along pathways such as sewers, cavities or natural\nfissures if these exist, or it may dissolve into leachates (liquids that have seeped through a\nlandfill extracting substances from the wastes en route) or groundwater and be transported in\nthat way. If not properly managed, landfill gas can give rise to flammability, toxicity and\nasphyxiation hazards, and bare patches, brown foliage and dieback in vegetation. \nIt may take from 3 months to a year before methane is evolved in significant amounts from\na site, and the process may continue for well over 15 years22, or even for 'many decades' after\nfilling with wastes has finished23. \nMethane (CH4) is one of gases which has contributed most to the enhanced greenhouse effect\nwhich may be leading to global warming24. The amounts of methane in the atmosphere have\nbeen increasing since the start of the 19th century and current levels are the highest ever\nobserved, including records from ice cores which go back 160,000 years. While the rate of\nincrease in the 1980s was lower than that of the 1970s, atmospheric methane is still\nincreasing. It is estimated that, globally, 20-40% of current methane emissions come from\nnatural sources (including the digestive systems of animals, rotting vegetation, anaerobic bogs\nand so on), 20% from fossil fuel related sources (such as the burning of coal and leakage\nfrom gas mains), and 40-60% from other man-made sources, including landfill25. \nIn the UK landfill is the single greatest source of methane, with around 46% of the UK's total\nemissions probably coming from landfill in 1994. The next largest contributions came from\ncattle at 21%; other sources (such as deep-mined coal, gas leakage and sheep) contributed\nunder 10% each26. In its report on the Incineration of Waste the Royal Commission on\nEnvironmental Pollution noted:27\n\"Nearly all of [the UK's municipal waste] goes to landfill where it produces both\ncarbon dioxide and methane and contributes substantially to the greenhouse effect.\nMethane has a particularly strong effect ... by incinerating municipal waste rather than\nlandfilling it a significant and worthwhile contribution could be made to reducing\nemissions of greenhouse gases.\" \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n22 DoE, Landfill Gas 2nd edition, 1991\n23 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution, Landfill gas: a report on the findings of surveys carried out by\n[HMIP] to assess the scale of the problem and provide recommendations for further action, DEP 6963 April\n1991\n24 see Global warming: environmental and economic effects, Library Research Paper 95/85, 7 July 1995 and\nGlobal warming: policy responses, Library Research Paper 95/86, 14 July 1995\n25 IPCC, Climate Change 1995 The Science of Climate Change.

The rate of methane production will also depend on\nthe composition, density and input rate of the landfilled waste, the moisture, temperature and\nacidity/alkalinity of the site, and the site's physical characteristics, which will affect the ease\nwith which the gas can escape. \nOf course the amount of methane evolved from a site will also depend on the control\nmeasures in place or the amount being harnessed. A particular problem in the past has been\nold sites, often closed local authority landfills, which had been neither designed nor operated\nwith gas control in mind. In 1987 HMIP wrote to all waste disposal authorities drawing to\ntheir attention the need to ensure that all landfill licences contained appropriate conditions for\nlandfill gas management, and a 1991 report from HMIP estimated that just over 1,000 sites\n(both active and closed, and private and local authority run) might need gas controls\ninstalled28. Following the 1990 EPA, the DoE issued guidance stating that all sites should be\nconsidered as having the potential to generate landfill gas, and that:29 \n\"No [landfill] licence should be issued until the [waste regulation authority] is\nsatisfied with the gas monitoring, and where necessary, gas control arrangements, as\ndetailed in the working plan.\" \nMonitoring measures comprise boreholes sunk around the perimeter of the site which can be\nused to check the performance of the gas extraction system and to ensure that gas is not\nmigrating sideways and out; they will end in a small cap or box above ground, and can be\nchecked using either installed or portable dataloggers30. Control measures may involve the\nuse of barriers with vent trenches or pipes used in conjunction with an active pumping system\nwhen passive venting is inadequate. When a gas is not combustible it can be directly vented\nto the atmosphere, or else support fuel can be added to burn it in a flarestack; this reduces\nassociated odour problems31. Gas flaring also reduces the amount of methane emitted to the\natmosphere, by converting it to carbon dioxide, a less powerful greenhouse gas32. \nRather than simply venting or flaring off landfill gas, it can be harnessed for energy. One\nstep up the waste hierarchy from disposal is recovery, and energy recovery from waste\nprojects are provided specifically for in the Non Fossil Fuel Obligations (NFFO). NFFO\nOrders require electricity companies to buy electricity at a premium rate from designated\nproducers who are not using fossil fuels; while they were originally aimed at nuclear power\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n28 HMIP, Landfill gas, DEP 6963 April 1991\n29 DoE, Landfill Gas 2nd edition, 1991 p.10\n30 Environment Agency, Landfill restoration and post closure management:consultation draft, Waste\nmanagement paper 26E, August 1996 p.233\n31 ibid\n32 DoE Climate Change; The UK Programme Cm 2427 January 1994 p.40\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nthey now cover renewables.

Prospective new landfill gas generating\nstations have to be from licensed sites where tipping was being carried out prior to 22 July\n199335. \nFriends of the Earth have said that \"only in a tiny fraction of possible cases is [landfill] gas\ncollected and used for fuel,\"36 although this statement was based on the results of a 1989\nsurvey. In the UK in 1994 around 163,000 tonnes of methane from landfills was being used\nto generate electricity37 and this was well over twice the amount harnessed in 199038.\nNevertheless, an estimated 1,790,000 tonnes of methane in total was emitted from landfills\nin 199439. The government has set a target of 300MW of electricity being generated from\nlandfill gas by the year 2000, which is one fifth of its overall target from renewable sources,\nand would mean using 520,000 tonnes of methane each year40. \nGenerally, electricity generation plants are situated at the landfill site, and the generation\nequipment, such as large spark ignition engines or gas turbines, are integrated with the gas\nextraction plant. Alternatively the gas can be pumped to a nearby end user, to provide heat\nin industrial processes such as firing and drying in brick and cement manufacturers, or raising\nsteam for the drying and bleaching of textiles or paper, heating commercial greenhouses or\nfood processing. Flarestacks are still needed to regulate the gas at a site whether or not\nenergy is extracted, and the gas may need a range of pre-treatments, particularly de-watering,\nbefore it can be used as a fuel41. \nHowever, Friends of the Earth make the point that being able to make use of some landfill\ngas is not a justification for continuing the practice of extensive landfill and their views\nreflect the waste hierarchy:42\n\"Landfilling waste is associated with a wide range of environmental problems. Using\nlandfill gas to generate energy only recovers a small fraction of the energy that is lost\nwhen the waste is landfilled- far greater energy savings are made if the waste is not\nproduced in the first place or if it is reused or recycled. Therefore the use of landfill\ngas as an energy source should not been seen as a justification for the continuing\nlandfilling of the vast majority of our waste.\" \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n35 DTI Press Release P/95/769 Richard Page sets up next renewable electricity round (NFFO) 2.11.95\n36 FoE Briefing Sheet Landfill gas and climate change, May 1992\n37 Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, Nineteenth Report - Sustainable Use of Soil, Cm 3165\nFebruary 1996 p.113\n38 ibid\n39 DoE Digest of Environmental Statistics No. 18, 1996 Table 1.3\n40 Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution Nineteenth Report Sustainable Use of Soil Cm 3165, February\n1996 p.113\n41 DoE/Welsh Office, Renewable Energy:Planning Policy Guidance Note 22: Annex on using landfill gas,\nOctober 1994\n42 FoE Briefing Sheet,Landfill gas and climate change, May 1992\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\n2. Co-disposal sites and inert material\nWhile landfill gas arises through biological degradation of waste, leachates form through both\nbiological and purely chemical reactions. Landfilled waste releases inorganic and organic\nmaterials, and also as reactions take place the products may become dissolved into solution.\nWith regard to co-disposal sites and sites accepting special waste, the DoE note that43:\n\"Although most landfills are chemical reactors, the reactions are particularly\nsignificant at a special waste or co-disposal landfill\"\nWhen the waste regulation authority/environment agency licence a landfill site, the DoE suggests44\nthat it may be useful to classify the site in two ways: firstly according to the types of waste it will\naccept, and secondly by the extent to which it is designed to contain pollutants; this will help\ndecide how complex and difficult the proposed site will be to operate.\nA suggested scheme is, according to waste accepted;\nSites which accept inert waste only\nSites which accept industrial waste that does not consist of and does not include\nspecial waste\nSites which accept other non-inert controlled waste that does not consist of and does\nnot include special waste; a combination of a special waste and some other controlled\nwaste if they can be disposed of together\nSites which accept special waste only\nAnd according to the principles of operation and containment;\nSites which include containment sites which are designed to allow no significant\nrelease of leachate, or migration of landfill gas\nSites that need few such measures, because the waste types/environmental setting pose\nno significant threat to the environment\nWhile many sites were licensed under CoPA 1974 to accept 'inert' wastes, the definition used\nat that time was not adequate, because it included materials that in fact degraded very slowly,\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n43 DoE, Licensing of waste management facilities 3rd edition, Waste management paper No.4 1994 p.43\n44 ibid p.41\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nsuch as wood from demolition sites. The practice of setting arbitrary limits to allow some\nsmall contamination of non-inert waste such as 5 or 10% for paper and cardboard was also\nconsidered ineffective and unenforceable by 1994; only genuinely inert waste should be\npermitted at sites licensed for inert waste. The DoE recommended that licence conditions\nspecify acceptable wastes such as soil, sand, clay, stone, concrete, bricks, slate, glass and\nceramics45. \nIn stark contrast to the complex reactions that may take place in a co-disposal site or a site\naccepting special wastes, \"landfill sites taking truly inert material will not produce significant\nconcentrations of pollutants. No important chemical or biological processes will take place\nin the site.\"46 It is unlikely that landfill gas or leachates will ever be generated in a truly inert\nsite which has never taken non-inert wastes, so the costs of running the site, of post-closure\nremediation and possible costs to the environment will be far lower.\nAt special waste or co-disposal sites, extra measures are needed. For instance, the location\nof any special waste deposit should be notified to the Environment Agency, and on-site\nlaboratory facilities may be needed for the analysis of waste accepted. \nThe acceptance of unauthorised waste at a landfill is an offence. For example, a waste\nproducer, carrier and landfill operator were recently fined £8000 plus costs following a\nprosecution brought by the Environment Agency after a consignment of special waste was\nbrought to a site and deposited, although it was later found to contain wastes not permitted\nby the site licence. The case was brought under CoPA 1974 and the EPA 1990 and came\nto light when a drum containing hydrochloric acid burst open during tipping; hydrofluoric\nacid was also included in the consignment. An Environment Agency spokesman stressed that\nsimilar cases involving breaches of the duty of care and legislation designed to protect the\nenvironment would be prosecuted by the Agency, and commented that 'It is vital that only\nwaste permitted by the site licence is accepted by landfill operators'.47,48 \nSimilarly, the Environment Agency has successfully prosecuted a Cambridgeshire landfill\noperator who held a landfill licence for chalk, soil and subsoil but had accepted concrete,\nasphalt, wood and green plastic piping. The operator was fined £10,000 plus costs49. \nIn one of the series of Industry Profiles sponsored by its Contaminated Land and Liabilities\nDivision, the DoE describes briefly the poor landfill practices which existed before regulation\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n45 ibid\n46 DoE Landfill Completion Waste management paper No.26A, 1993 p.4\n47 Croner Waste Management Briefing No. 47, 1 August 1996 p.4\n48\n\"Dicing with death at the landfill face\", ENDS Report 258, July 1996 pp 21-23\n49\n\"Landfill operator fined\" Croner Environment Briefing No.53, 19 June 1996 p.1\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nand the increased awareness of the potential hazards of landfill50:\n\"Landfill sites were originally small informal and uncontrolled tips used by local\nauthorities or industry for the disposal of waste to land ... Prior to the 1970s the\nmajority had little or no engineering control of wastes beyond that provided by the\nlocal topography and geology.\"\nIn 1994 a company called UK Waste, which had been auditing 158 landfill sites with a view\nto acquiring these, released the results of its survey which showed, it said, poor engineering\nstandards at many sites. While UK Waste reportedly has a policy of operating only\ncontainment sites with at least a single containment liner, plus leachate and gas management\nand monitoring systems, it found that of all sites surveyed (68 of which were closed and 90\noperational) 54% had no leachate collection systems and half had no gas control systems.\nOf the operational sites, 22% were on in situ clay, 17% had a single liner and 12% composite\nliners; the rest, around half, had no liners but were so called 'dilute and disperse' sites. UK\nWaste alleged that this meant its costs for landfilling were in the mid-teens per tonne while\nother operators could undercut them at £5-10 per tonne. The company criticised the practice\nof allowing old landfill sites to continue operating 'indefinitely until they were full', and also\ncalled on the DoE to make it clear that co-disposal should not be carried out in anything but\nengineered containment sites.51 \n3. Completion and restoration \nA landfill licence cannot be surrendered unless the Environment Agency accepts this\nsurrender; the Agency must inspect the land and be satisfied that the site is unlikely to cause\npollution of the environment or harm to human health (and thereby meets the so-called\n'completion condition' under the 1990 EPA). It can then issue a 'completion certificate'. \nTo check whether a site meets the 'completion condition' the quantity and quality of leachate\npresent, the flow and concentration of gas, the future potential for leachate and gas to be\nformed, any physical instability and the presence of particular problem wastes all need to be\nconsidered. Each site needs a case by case assessment. \nRestoration is the process through which a landfill site is returned to a condition suitable for\nafter-use. Draft Waste Management Paper (WMP) 26E on Landfill restoration and post\nclosure management52 has just been issued and the consultation period ends on 18 November\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n50 DoE, Waste recycling, treatment and disposal sites landfills and other waste treatment or disposal sites, 1996\n51\n\"UK Waste hits out at landfill standards\", ENDS Report, December 1994 pp 10-11\n52 Environment Agency, August 1996\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\n199653. The Environment Agency emphasises the need for a holistic approach\nto landfill, to integrate the process \"from initial concept to final capping, restoration and\naftercare.\" \nSeveral after-use options exist and include agriculture, woodland, amenity or nature\nconservation, or 'hard end' uses (such as a car park). In the past agricultural uses (particularly\nas pasture) have been the most common after-use for landfill sites, but this could be attributed\nto the importance attached to agricultural production and concerns about the feasibility of\nother uses; for example, planting trees on a capped site has in the past been discouraged, but\nthis advice is now being reviewed. \nProblems in the past have often resulted from a lack or loss of suitable restoration materials\nin the form of suitable topsoils, the availability of which are critical in the choice of afteruse\n(although on-site soil substitutes such as dredgings, sediment, spoils or waste limestone may\nbe used as subsoils to reduce the amount of soil that needs to be imported to a site). The\ntype of waste which a site has accepted is another important influence in the choice of\nafteruse; a site that has taken largely inert wastes will be suitable for a range of afteruses\nincluding hard development. Conversely a site containing biodegradable wastes, particularly\na deep site, will probably not be suitable for a hard end use because it will experience\nproblems of unstable and contaminated ground and of landfill gas generation. \nThe pollution control systems needed on a closed landfill may include a capping layer,\nleachate and landfill gas systems, and monitoring points for settlement, groundwater quality,\nleachate and gas. While many old landfills are not capped, and inert sites may not need a\ncapping system, where one is used it may be constructed of clay, a synthetic material, a\npurpose-designed geotextile or a combination of these. Detailed advice is given by the\nEnvironment Agency in draft WMP 26E as to the design of capping and gas and leachate\nsystems. \n4. Planning and other controls\nAs well as the usual planning system which operates through the Town and Country Planning\nAct 1990 in England and Wales and through the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act\n1972 as amended, landfills are subject to extra controls. The Government's planning policy\nguidance notes, particularly PPG 2354, give advice on how the planning system relates to\nlandfill sites, and the Environment Agency's draft Waste Management Paper 26E55 gives a\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n53 HC Deb 16.10.96 c.1059W\n54 DoE, Planning and Pollution Control, July 1994\n55 Landfill restoration and post closure management, August 1996\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nuseful summary of the planning framework. \nThe Planning and Compensation Act 1991 allows local authorities to impose five year\n'aftercare periods' to follow the completion of any restoration conditions at any site where\nrefuse or waste has been deposited. Under the 1990 EPA landfill licences may also have\nconditions attached relating to aftercare (ie, to the period after landfill operations have\nfinished). In addition, the waste regulation authority often requires a restoration plan to be\nsubmitted with the application for a waste management licence. Applicants must show that\nthey have arranged funding for long term obligations, such as monitoring water and landfill\ngas56. \nThe Environment Agency is thought to be currently reviewing its policy regarding the\nprovision of financial guarantees for landfill sites. There has been speculation that it favours\nthe use of escrow accounts (an independent fund into which the operator pays a fixed sum\nper tonne of waste landfilled). The money is not tax deductible until spent and is not under\nthe operator's control. The Environmental Services Association, the trade association which\nrepresents much of the waste disposal industry, has commented that 'Locking away millions\nof pounds at low interest won't help anyone' and favours companies being able to simply\nmake provision in their accounts. Several companies have called on the Agency not to make\nescrow accounts a normal condition of a landfill licence, and to reduce the sums involved57.\nDirective 85/337/EEC on Environmental Impact Assessment58 requires Member States to\nensure that projects likely to have a significant effect on the environment by virtue of their\nnature, size or location are subject to environmental assessment (EA). The assessment can\nthen be used by the planning authority when deciding whether to grant planning permission.\nEA is required for projects listed in two Annexes to the Directive, roughly equivalent to the\nSchedules of the UK implementing regulations. Landfill sites for special waste will always\nrequire EA and other landfill sites probably will if they have a capacity of over 75,000 tonnes\na year59. (The Directive is presently being tightened.) Sites accepting inert waste only are\nunlikely to need EA60. The developer has to submit a plan along with the planning\napplication describing the site's nature and size, to let the local planning authority decide\nwhether the development is likely to require full EA.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n56 Environment Agency, Landfill restoration and post closure management: consultation draft, Waste\nManagement Paper 26E August 1996 p.19\n57\n\"Landfill operators battle to limit burden of financial guarantees\", ENDS Report 260, September 1996 p.13\n58 implemented in England and Wales primarily through the Town and Country Planning (Assessment of\nEnvironmental Effects) Regulations SI 1199/1988 and in Scotland by the Environmental Assessment\n(Scotland) Regulations SI 1988/1221, both as amended\n59 DoE Circular 15/88 (Welsh Office 23/88), Environmental Assessment, 12 July 1988\n60 Environment Agency,  Landfill restoration and post closure management: consultation draft, August 1996\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nIII Landfill tax \nA. First proposals for a tax on waste\nThe idea that new taxes can be used to tackle environmental problems was given serious\nconsideration in the White Paper This Common Inheritance - a review of all aspects of UK\nenvironmental policy published in 1990. \"Taxes can be the most effective means of tackling\nenvironmental problems, and so merit serious examination\", it was suggested, though this\nstatement was qualified by the observation that, \"their use raises wider economic, social and\nindustrial consequences which need to be weighed in the balance.\"61 Nonetheless, the White\nPaper made a strong case that governments could not rely solely on regulation in any\neffective environmental strategy:62\n1.25 If Governments want to stop something happening, or make something happen\nin a different way, they have broadly two choices: they can by law lay down rules\nand regulations on standards to be met or equipment to be installed; or they can use\nthe market to influence the behaviour of producers and their customers. Whichever\ncourse they choose, the objective is to make those who cause environmental damage\nface the costs of control in full, without subsidy. That is called the \"polluter pays\"\nprinciple which the Government, in common with many other Governments, adopts.\nIf we impose higher standards centrally, this puts extra costs on producers and on\ntheir customers in turn; if we use price signals, for example by imposing charges or\ntaxes on certain activities, extra costs again fall on the manufacturers, and then on\ntheir customers. This \"polluter pays\" principle is an important means of influencing\npotential polluters.\n1.26 In the past, governments in Britain and elsewhere have mostly used regulation\nto control pollution. \"Fog everywhere\", wrote Dickens about Victorian London.\nEventually, the British Government used the law to impose regulations to clean up\nLondon's air. And there are large numbers of laws and regulations to protect the\nquality of our water and air and to control disposal of wastes on land. This regulatory\napproach has served Britain and other countries well, and it will remain an important\npart of future environmental controls. For example, our new system of integrated\npollution control will regulate industrial processes of all types to ensure the best\noutcome for the environment as a whole.\n1.27 Regulation, however, does have limitations. It can be expensive to monitor and\ndifficult to up-date quickly in response to scientific and technical advance. It cannot\nalways pitch controls at the level which strikes the most cost-effective balance\nbetween environmental benefits and compliance costs. Compliance costs can fall\nwidely - on business, on Government, and on consumers - and are easy to\nunderestimate in advance. And so long as it remains the responsibility of the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n61 DoE, This Common Inheritance - Britain's environmental strategy, Cm 1200 September 1990 p.275\n62 op.cit. pp 13-14\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nregulator, usually central Government, to lay down the ways in which pollution targets\nshould be met, there will always be the danger that insufficiently flexible systems will\nbe created and some better options overlooked. In short, regulation has always been\nrequired and is still required, but it has its shortcomings.\n1.28 For these reasons the Government, along with other Governments throughout the\nworld, has begun to look for ways to control pollution which avoid some of these\nproblems by working with the grain of the market. The ideas include various forms\nof pollution charges, as well as taxes and other economic instruments, all designed to\nencourage consumers and producers to behave in ways which benefit the environment\n...\n1.29 These new approaches have been described loosely as the market-based approach\nto the environment, since they involve integrating economic and environmental\nconcerns and applying market economics more broadly. In the Government's view,\nmarket mechanisms offer the prospect of a more efficient and flexible response to\nenvironmental issues, both old and new.\nIndeed, the \"polluter pays\" principle - that the cost of preventing pollution or minimising\nenvironmental damage due to pollution should be borne by those responsible for the pollution\n- is one of the foundations of the EC's environmental policy.63 Though the White Paper\nargued that those responsible for waste discharges should pay for the social cost of disposing\nof that waste, it did not propose a landfill levy, instead referring to recycling credits and to\nmarket forces pushing the costs of disposal generally:64\nThe Government's policy is to harness market forces more effectively to encourage\nwaste minimisation. The Environmental Protection Bill establishes a strict\nenvironmental regime for the disposal of waste, whether it is burned (incineration) or\nput in the ground (landfill). One effect of this will be to make waste disposal much\nmore expensive. Increasing disposal costs will in turn provide a strong incentive for\nindustry to cut down the volume of waste it produces and to make more use of\ncleaner technologies.\nIn 1993 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution published a report - Incineration\nof Waste65 - which made the case that the methods of waste disposal posed a serious\nenvironmental problem, in part because the pricing of different methods did not accurately\nreflect their true costs. The report included an analysis by Aspinwall & Co of the relative\ncosts of waste disposal by landfill and incineration. The Commission pointed out that both\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n63 In fact the principle is included in the Treaty of Rome: National Society for Clean Air Pollution Handbook\n1996, p.5 \n64 op.cit. p.187\n65 Cm 2181 May 1993. The Commission's views on the competing claims of incineration and landfill were\ndiscussed above, in section I A of this paper.\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nthis report, and a second one on landfill costs produced by Coopers & Lybrand66, excluded\nthe environmental costs associated with incineration and landfill:67\nThese environmental costs do not have to be met by the operators of a waste disposal\nfacility, and in consequence are unlikely to be taken into account in their investment\nand operational decisions. In other words, the private costs to the operator are not\nlikely to reflect fully the overall cost of waste disposal to the community. If disposal\ncharges are as a result lower than the full economic costs of disposal (including the\nenvironmental costs), the quantities of waste sent for disposal may be larger, and the\nproportion recycled smaller, than would be the case if the charges reflected the full\neconomic costs. Moreover the methods of disposal chosen may not correspond with\nthe best practicable environmental option.\nFor its part, the Coopers & Lybrand report on a landfill levy68 estimated that the costs of\nlandfill could rise by between 37 and 135% by the year 2000 in some scenarios (eg, inner\ncities where land is expensive), approaching or exceeding the cost of incineration even\nwithout a levy. Even so, it went on to conclude that if a levy were to be introduced its\nprimary effect would be an increase in the amount of waste being incinerated, especially in\nhigh landfill cost urban areas, where incineration was expected to become progressively more\nattractive than landfill.\nThe Royal Commission noted pretreatment of landfill waste by incineration could reduce the\nlong term risks from pollution, the production of greenhouse gases, and the incidence of\nleaching from landfill sites (since incinerated waste in the form of slag and ash is biologically\ninactive by comparison with raw municipal waste), as well as cut the volume of waste\ndeposited in landfill by up to 90%. However, those using landfill sites had to see incineration\nas financially desirable, something that the current pricing structure could not deliver. As a\nconsequence, the Commission recommended that a levy be applied to all waste deposited in\nlandfill sites:69\nWe are convinced that a levy on waste disposal is justifiable in order to reflect the\ncost to the community of the environmental effects of waste disposal and the benefit\nfrom the reduced use of raw materials and energy made possible by recycling. We\nwould expect the cost of a levy to be passed on in charges to waste disposal\nauthorities, and in turn passed on by them to households through higher council tax\npayments and to firms through charges for the disposal of commercial waste. Both\nhouseholds and (more directly) firms would then have an incentive to produce less\nwaste and recycle waste materials, so reducing levels of pollution.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n66 DoE, Landfill costs and prices: correcting possible market distortions, NS 8852 February 1993\n67 Cm 2181 May 1993 para 9.30\n68 DoE, Landfill costs and prices: correcting possible market distortions, NS 8852 February 1993\n69 Cm 2181 May 1993 para 9.34\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nOne other reason for a levy, mentioned in the Coopers and Lybrand report, was that it could\nprovide a clean up fund for managing later environmental difficulties which might arise.\nEnvironmental Trusts were first mentioned in a consultation paper - issued by Customs &\nExcise in March 1995:70 non-profit making distributing bodies, in the private sector, making\ngrants to restore closed landfill sites, and financing research into more sustainable waste\nmanagement practices. Their introduction is discussed in detail in section IV C of this paper.\nB. Government consultation on the tax\n1. Basis of the tax\nWhen he first proposed a new tax on landfill in his 1994 Budget speech, the Chancellor,\nKenneth Clarke, argued that the tax would achieve the twin objectives of raising money and\nprotecting the environment, without adding to the burdens of business:71\nTaxes can play an important role in protecting the environment. One major\nproblem is the disposal of waste. I would like to make an announcement\ntoday to help tackle the problem. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of\nState for the Environment and I will issue shortly a consultation paper\nsetting out details of a new tax to be collected by Customs and Excise on\nwaste disposed in landfill. We propose that a new landfill tax should come\ninto effect in 1996. It should raise several hundred million pounds a year.\nBut I am determined not to impose additional costs on business overall. I\nshall therefore be looking at ways to offset the impact of the new tax by\nmaking further compensatory reductions in the level of employer national\ninsurance contributions when the new tax is introduced. In brief, I want to\nraise tax on polluters to make further cuts in the tax on jobs.\nThe consultation paper issued in March 1995 proposed an ad valorem basis for the tax, with\nthe aim of striking \"the best balance between environmental justification and practical\nfeasibility.\"72 An ad valorem tax was preferred to a specific duty charged by reference to\nweight or volume of waste disposed. It was argued that this provided \"a straightforward\nproxy for the environmental impacts of landfill disposal\", and that an ad valorem tax would\nhave lower compliance costs and would be easier to police than other possible taxes.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n70 HM Customs & Excise, Landfill Tax - a consultation paper, March 1995 p.11. The paper was issued to\ngather views on the design of the tax, following the Chancellor's announcement the previous November.\n71 HC Deb 29.11.94 c.1098\n72 HM Customs & Excise, Landfill Tax - a consultation paper, March 1995 p.5\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nA number of respondents argued that the practical effects of an ad valorem tax might well\nconflict with the environmental objectives of the Government had in introducing it, in\nparticular by encouraging those disposing of waste to use the cheapest sites, sites which most\nlikely have lower environmental standards, and transporting their waste longer distances by\nroad to reach these sites. In addition, it was thought an ad valorem charge would result in\nmore illegal tipping of waste (\"fly-tipping\"; see below), and hit those local authorities in areas\nwhere land was relatively scarce for landfill sites. As a consequence in August the\nChancellor announced that landfill tax would be weight-based, charged per tonne of waste,\nand that inert waste would be subject to a reduced rate of tax.73 The announcement was\ngenerally welcomed, notably by the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors.74\n2. Local authorities\nAn important characteristic of the tax is that it is to be charged on all those who use landfill\n- local authorities just as much as private companies. Indeed, in the consultation process that\nhas followed the 1994 Budget announcement, the Government has consistently emphasised\nthat for the tax to achieve its purpose, it would have to affect the behaviour of all those who\nuse landfill sites. For example, in a long written answer in March 1996 the then Paymaster\nGeneral, David Heathcoat-Amory noted the following:75\n\"The underlying purpose of the tax is to make environmental costs [of waste\ndisposal] explicit and ensure that those contemplating activities with\nenvironmental impacts take account of those costs. The tax will also\nprovide an incentive for waste producers to look for new ways to reduce the\namount of waste they produce.\"\nIn the March 1995 consultation paper, the impact of the new charge on local authorities was\ndiscussed:76\nLocal authorities are responsible for the collection and disposal of household wastes,\nand the cost of tax in respect of such wastes would fall on them ... [the Government\nis to] look at ways to offset the impact of the new tax by making reductions in the\nlevel of employer national insurance contributions when the tax is introduced. This\nwill also benefit local authorities.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n73 HM Customs & Excise press notice, Chancellor strengthens landfill tax, 2 August 1995\n74\n\"Landfill tax to be based on weight\", Financial Times, 3 August 1995\n75 HC Deb 12.3.96 cc 550-552W\n76 HM Customs & Excise Landfill Tax - A Consultation Paper, March 1995 p.4\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nIn September 1995 HM Customs & Excise published a report on the responses it had received\nto the consultation paper. One issue raised by correspondents had been the impact of the new\ntax on local authorities:77\n6. Effect  of  the  tax  on  local  authorities\nAs indicated above, local authorities were particularly active in expressing their views\nand concerns, which included:\n• fly-tipping - cost of policing and removal;\n• cost of the tax and how it will be met, including the gap between the tax burden and\nbenefit of employers' national insurance contributions (NICS) reductions, although\nthere was a great deal of uncertainty about the net financial impact;\n• whether local authorities will be able to pass on the cost of the tax to householders\nvia the Council Tax; and\n• the lack of incentive that the tax offers to those ultimately producing waste to\nchange their behaviour, particularly householders.\nThe Government's response was included in Customs' report:78\nThe Government recognises taxes will never be universally popular but welcomes the\nsupport received for the tax which it believes will help curb damage to the\nenvironment. This will be introduced as planned on 1 October 1996 ...\nThe concerns of local authorities are also understood by the Government. Local\nauthorities are responsible for the collection and disposal of household waste, and it\nis recognised that the cost of the tax in respect of such waste that is landfilled will fall\non them. The proposed reductions in employers' NICs will affect local authorities\nand, over the coming months, the Government will address the issue of the financial\nimpact of the tax on local authorities in the context of the local government finance\nsettlement.\nWhen the tax was debated on the floor of the House in January 1996, David Heathcoat-\nAmory emphasised that some businesses and some local authorities would see an increase in\ntheir costs as a consequence of this new impost:79\n\"There are bound to be winners and losers. Not all businesses or types of\nbusiness will unequivocally be winners because they will incur landfill tax\ncharges that are greater than any benefit that they receive in national\ninsurance contributions. That is true for local authorities as a whole.\"\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n77 HM Customs & Excise, Landfill Tax - report on responses received to consultation paper, September 1995\npp 4-5\n78 op.cit. p.6\n79 HC Deb 23.1.96 c.170\n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nSome have argued that the \"losers\" from a landfill levy will include council taxpayers. The\nScottish Local Government Information Unit, funded by Scottish local authorities and trade\nunions, has claimed the tax will probably not increase recycling rates in the near future,\nbecause the cost of setting up recycling operations to reduce the amounts of landfill tax paid\nwill \"require additional resources which local authorities, in the light of the last budget\nsettlement, will be unable to meet.\"80 Indeed, the 1993 Coopers & Lybrand study on a\nlandfill levy estimated that in the short term a landfill tax of £10 per tonne would lead to a\n£5 per head increase in council tax in England and Wales, falling to £3 per head as local\nauthorities found alternatives to landfill.81\n3. Fly-tipping\nThe second issue that Customs found caused especial concern was the impact of the new tax\non fly-tipping:82 \n5. Effect  on  fly-tipping\nConcern over fly-tipping was one of the most common themes in responses received.\n273 respondents (38 per cent) believed that the tax could or would lead to an increase\nin fly-tipping. Of these, 187 were from local authorities (57 per cent of local\nauthorities who replied). Thirteen site operators also believed that the tax might\nincrease fly-tipping, as did a number of trade associations.\nThe following concerns/questions about the fly-tipping issue recurred within these\nreplies:\n• Fly-tipping will increase which will be detrimental to the environment and thus\ncounter to one of the main objectives of the tax.\n• Who will remove fly-tipped waste and who, if anyone, will pay the tax on it?\n• Both local authorities and Customs will find it difficult to detect and enforce any\npenalties given their lack of resources.\n• Greater policing and penalties must be introduced to deal with fly-tipping.\nAt the time, the Government conceded fly-tipping could be a problem, but that the existing\nregulatory regime would be sufficient deterrent against its growth:83\nOther countries which have a landfall tax in place appear not to have significant\nproblems with fly-tipping, although the Government is naturally concerned to see that\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n80\n\"A new rubbish tax\", Scottish Local Government No. 86, October 1996 \n81 DoE, Landfill costs and prices: correcting possible market distortions, NS 8852 February 1993 p.vi\n82 Landfill Tax - report on responses ..., September 1995 pp 4-5\n83 ibid p.6\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nwaste disposal methods are adequately policed after the introduction of the tax. The\nmain security against fly-tipping is the regulatory framework. Regulations\nimplemented on 1 May 1994 introduced a new waste management licensing system.\nThese controls, along with section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and\nthe associated duty of care for waste which came into force on 1 April 1992, are\nintended to address the problem of fly-tipping, amongst other matters. They should\nprovide a strong regulatory framework to support the new tax. Further thought will\nbe given to the policing of the landfall tax and of waste disposal methods over the\ncoming months.\nThe Government reiterated its position on fly-tipping at the time of the November 1995\nBudget:84 \nThe Government has also responded to concern expressed during the consultation\nexercise that fly-tipping may increase as a result of the tax. The current waste\nmanagement licensing system and duty of care for waste provide a strong regulatory\nframework to support the tax. Fly-tipping is already a criminal offence and the\nGovernment therefore sees no need to make it a revenue offence in tax law.\nHowever, it will take further steps to combat fly-tipping when the tax is implemented.\nIn particular, the Environment Agencies will be asked to give a high priority to the\nprevention of fly-tipping. The courts will be reminded about the environmental\nimpact of fly-tipping and the financial gains which are made by perpetrators.\nFurther details of the Government's policy to deal with fly-tipping were given by the\nSecretary of State:85\nSir David Steel: To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment if he\nwill make a statement outlining the respective roles of his Department and\nthe new Environment Agency in implementing the landfall tax, with special\nreference to what new steps will be taken to prevent illegal dumping and fly\ntipping in the countryside, and to relieve landowners on whose property such\nwaste is deposited from liability to pay the tax when they transport it to\ndesignated landfill sites.\nMr. Gummer: My Department is responsible for the overall regulatory\nframework for waste management in England and Wales. Regulations\nimplemented on 1 May 1994 introduced a new waste management licensing\nsystem. The associated duty of care for waste came into force on 1 April\n1992. The penalties that can be imposed for offences relating to waste are\nalready severe, and these controls provide a strong regulatory framework to\nsupport the introduction of the landfill tax.

The Government's guidance\nto the agency on its objectives and contribution to sustainable development,\nwhich will be laid before Parliament very shortly, will clarify its role in this\narea. Ministers will expect the agency to act upon its powers and to review\nprocedures for preventing and handling cases of fly tipping. The\nGovernment have no plans to relieve the occupiers of land on which waste\nis deposited illegally from liability to pay landfill tax where they dispose of\nthe waste to licensed landfill sites.\nMost recently, when asked what steps would be taken to increase the penalties for fly-tipping\nfollowing the introduction of the tax, the government pointed out that the penalties were\nalready severe, and summarised the existing maximum penalties for waste related offences\nin a written answer. For the unlawful deposit or disposal of non-special or special waste,\nthese are imprisonment for six months and/or a fine of £20,000 following prosecution in the\nMagistrates' court, or imprisonment for two years and/or an unlimited fine in the Crown\ncourt86. \nC. Introduction of the tax \nIn his 1995 Budget speech, the Chancellor confirmed that the new tax would come into\noperation on 1 October 1996:87\nLast year I proposed a new landfill tax, which is a charge on the disposal\nof waste in, for example, tips and old quarries. That will come into effect\non 1 October 1996. It will be charged at a standard rate of £7 a tonne and\na lower rate of £2 for inactive waste. That is a tax on waste in order to\nenable me to reduce the tax on jobs. The money raised by the landfill tax\nwill allow for a matching cut in the main rate of employers' national\ninsurance contributions by a further 0.2 per cent to 10 per cent from April\n1997. That will cut the cost of employment by half a billion pounds and\nwill make it cheaper for businesses to create new jobs.\nLegislation to bring in the tax was included in the Finance Bill, introduced in January 1996.88\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n86 HC Deb 5.11.96 cc 459-60W\n87 HC Deb 28.11.95 cc 1063-1064\n88 It is now contained in sections 39-71 of the Finance Act 1996.\n30\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nIn setting the rates of tax at £7 and £2 per tonne, the Government was keen to emphasize the\npurpose of the tax was not to severely curtail landfill use as such, let alone stop it. Rather,\nthe tax would help to align more closely the price charged for landfill, and the true costs of\nusing it. This point was illustrated well in an exchange during the proceedings of the Finance\nBill, between the then Paymaster General, David Heathcoat-Amory, and Dawn Primarolo\nMP:89\nI repeat the point that capturing those external costs, whether they be\npollution or a form of nuisance to residents and others, is an important\nconsideration. It will encourage the waste producers, whoever they may be,\nto look for ways to produce less waste and to reuse and recycle more waste\nif they cannot avoid producing it. We know that there is substantial scope\nfor businesses and others to adopt better waste management practices. The\ntax will give them a precise incentive to continue to do so.\nIn other words, what we are proposing will reinforce the existing policy of\nsustainable waste management, which was set out in considerable detail in\nthe White Paper published by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for\nthe Environment last month. The concept in the White Paper was of a waste\nhierarchy, headed by waste minimisation. The most desirable aim must be\nnot to produce so much waste. Lower down the hierarchy is reusing waste.\nFurther down again comes the recovery of waste, which can include\nrecycling, composting and energy recovery from incineration. The hon.\nMember for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson), who is no longer in her\nplace, was under the misapprehension that the landfill tax would somehow\nact as a disincentive or inhibition on composting. In fact, the reverse is the\ncase, as the hierarchy shows. If waste can be composted, it will avoid\nlandfill tax. At the bottom of the waste hierarchy is disposal, which includes\nlandfill.\nThe landfill tax will be an important means of moving waste up the\nhierarchy and away from landfill. The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms\nPrimarolo) said, bafflingly, that the tax would send a signal that landfill was\nthe most desirable means of disposal. That calls into question her\nunderstanding of the whole principle of the tax because the reverse is the\ncase. By taxing landfill, we are providing an incentive to move to other,\nmore environmentally benign means of dealing with waste.\nMs Primarolo: A study for the Department of the Environment undertaken\nby Coopers and Lybrand showed that with a levy on landfill even as high\nas £20 per tonne, recycling would still remain a relatively unattractive\nfinancial option and that the use of the tax alone would not be enough to\ndevelop alternatives. Therefore, essentially the Government are saying that\nlandfall is all right or that options that are worse than landfill but cheaper\nare also all right.\nMr. Heathcoat-Amory: The hon. Lady is now arguing for a much higher\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n89 HC Deb 23.1.96 c.167\n31\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nrate of tax, which can only double the anxiety expressed by some of my\nhon. Friends. If she is suggesting that the modest tax we are proposing will\nnot boost recycling in the way that we wish, that is an argument for a higher\ncharge. We do not accept that. Although the tax will not overnight create\nvast quantities of recycled waste, that might be a good thing. By flooding\nthe market with recycled products we might kill the very process that we are\ntrying to promote. We believe that the tax rates of £2 and £7 will at least\nnudge the market towards a greater use of recycled materials and therefore\nmove waste generally up the hierarchy that I described earlier.\nAt separate stages in the Finance Bill's progress, it was suggested that it was unfair to\npenalise landfill sites that were well run, and that dealt just with entirely safe and innocuous\nmaterials. In reply, the then Paymaster General, David Heathcoat-Amory, made an important\npoint:90\nBy taxing landfill, we will encourage the development of alternative ways\nof dealing with waste. Indeed, it will lead to less waste in the first place.\nThat justification for the tax is valid even if the landfill site is well\nengineered ...\nThe tax is designed not only to tax waste with the potential to pollute water\nor air, but to catch the external costs associated with the landfilling or rubble\nwaste and all categories of inactive waste. Such activities are not without\nenvironmental impact. I am sure that some letters from my hon. Friends'\nconstituents, who live near landfill sites, reflect the problems cause by noise,\ndust, smell, seagulls and lorry movements. Those represent an external cost\nof landfilling even inactive or inert waste. The tax is designed to capture\nthose costs and to attribute them to the producer of the waste. The proposed\nlower rate of tax at £2 per tonne reflects the lower impact on the\nenvironment caused by that category of waste.\nDuring the proceedings of the Finance Bill in spring 1996, a variety of industries argued that\ncertain types of waste be exempted completely from the new tax, or covered by the lower £2\ninert charge.91 As it turned out, three types of waste were specified as exempt from tax:\ndredgings from waterways, natural waste from mines and quarries and waste from the\nreclamation of historically contaminated land. In March details of the types of waste to be\ncharged the lower £2 per tonne rate of tax were given:92\nMr. Matthew Banks: To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what was the\noutcome of the Customs and Excise consultation exercise on the scope of\nthe lower rate of landfill tax.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n90 HC Deb 23.1.96 c.187; Standing Committee E 8.2.96 c.160\n91\n\"Arguments over the landfill tax get down to the nitty-gritty\", ENDS Report, January 1996 pp 20-23\n92 HC Deb 25.3.96 cc 439-440W\n32\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nMr. Heathcoat-Amory: Customs and Excise have now analyzed the replies\nwhich they received to the consultation exercise on the scope of the lower\nrate of landfill tax. On the basis of the information provided and\nrepresentation made, we have concluded that the lower rate of landfill tax\nshould apply to the wastes listed. Mixtures consisting only of listed wastes\nwill qualify for the lower rate, as will water with suspended solids consisted\nonly of listed wastes.\nIn order to be taxable at the lower rate, listed wastes   or mixtures of such\nwastes   must not contain or be contaminated with any material which is not\nlisted. If they are, the standard rate of tax will apply. But a de minimis level\nwill apply to enable wastes to qualify for the lower rate if they consist\nwholly of listed wastes, apart from a small quantity of material which is not\nlisted, provided that the material does not lead to any potential for pollution.\nWhere wastes appear on the lower rate list and are also covered by an\nexemption, the exemption will apply.\n \nNaturally occurring rocks and soils, including:\nclay, sand, gravel, sandstone, limestone, crushed stone, china clay, clean building\nor demolition stone such as sandstone, limestone or slate, topsoil, peat, coal, silt\nand dredgings.\nCeramic or cemented materials\nGlass.\nCeramics, including bricks (see below for bricks with plaster), tiles, clay ware,\npottery, china, bricks and mortar.\nConcrete, including reinforced concrete, concrete blocks, breeze blocks and\nthermalite blocks.\nProcessed or prepared mineral materials, which have not been used or\ncontaminated\nMoulding sands and clays.\nClay absorbents, including Fuller's earth and bentonite and other mineral\nabsorbents.\nMan-made mineral fibres, including glass fibre.\nSilica.\nMica.\nAbrasives.\nFurnace slags\nCertain ash:\nBottom ash and fly ash from wood or coal combustion (including pulverised fuel\nash from coal combustion).\nLow activity inorganic compounds:\nTitanium dioxide.\nCalcium carbonate.\nMagnesium carbonate.\nMagnesium oxide.\nMagnesium hydroxide.\nFerric oxide.\nFerric hydroxide.\nAluminium oxide.\n33\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nGypsum and plaster\nThese will be subject to the lower rate only if disposed of in landfall sites\nlicensed only to take inactive or inert waste.\nOther wastes\nThere are, in addition to the above, a few wastes on which Custom and Excise\nare seeking further information before a conclusion is reached as to whether the\nlower rate is appropriate.\nMixtures consisting of these wastes, it was explained, would qualify for the lower rate.\nMixtures that contained a small quantity of active waste - chargeable at the £7 rate - would\nstill qualify for the lower rate provided the mixture posed no risk of pollution.\nFor its part, the Institute of Wastes Management was sceptical of the value in charging the\ntax at an inert rate and an active rate:93\n[During the 1970s and 80s...] Inert waste as a term was suitably ambiguous for\noperators and regulators to use when disposing of builders rubble, construction waste,\nspoil, soil and other extraneous materials. Most of these materials were in fact\nanything but inert and contributed to leachate, landfill gas and settlement on old and\nnot so old landfill sites. The term became notorious, and quite rightly, went out of\nuse as the potential environmental harm from such wastes became more widely\nunderstood. \nFollowing details of the landfill tax announcement in November 1995, we now learn\nthat the lower rate of landfill tax will be levied on 'inactive' wastes which 'do not\nphysically or chemically react, biodegrade or adversely affect other matter with which\nit comes into contact in a way likely to give rise to environmental pollution'. Such\nwastes include naturally occurring rocks and subsoils, uncontaminated materials, glass,\nceramics and concrete.\nLeaving aside the relative 'inactivity' of these materials, a number of questions are\nraised by this. When in practice are these wastes delivered to a disposal facility\n(landfill) uncontaminated? Will a saving of £5 per tonne be a sufficient financial\nincentive for waste producers to ensure that their wastes are inactive and therefore\nqualify for the lower rate tax? Will the regulatory system be able to identify\nsatisfactorily that which is truly inactive and uncontaminated against the opposite?\nMore to the point, will the driving force behind such an inspection system be a\nfinancial one (higher or lower tax) or an environmental (inactive or active waste) one?\nDuring the Committee stage of the Finance Bill, the Labour Party suggested that a third tax\nrate of £15 could be levied on \"special waste\". The Government opposed this, on the grounds\nthat this category had not been defined, that hazardous waste was subject to tight controls as\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n93\n\"IWM Comment : Inert by any other name\", Wastes Management, February 1996 \n34\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nit was, and that the tax should be simple and easy to understand. In the event, the proposal\nwas rejected.94\nAt the time of the November 1995 Budget, Customs issued a compliance cost assessment on\nthe impact the new tax would have on business, focusing on those required to account for the\ntax to Customs (ie, those who run landfill sites). About 1,400 businesses will be required to\nregister with Customs, operating about 2,700 sites overall. The industry is dominated by\nsmall firms; the largest five companies in this sector, who each have a turnover in excess of\n£100 million, represent about 20 per cent of the market. For larger operators, it was thought\nstart up costs associated with the tax would be around £25,000 to £50,000; continuing\ncompliance costs might be around £4,000 per year. Estimates received from small firms put\nthe equivalent costs for this size of company at about £750 for initial costs. In relation to\ncompliance costs, Customs felt many small firms overestimated how much they would need\nto set aside (in reply, firms gave figures between £200 and £2,500+ per quarter, with an\naverage of £1,400). Firms were, it felt, giving large estimates for the costs of routine record\nkeeping and form filling, aggregating landfill costs with costs associated with Customs\ngenerally, and exaggerating the frequency of Customs' visits. \nAll told, Customs felt annual compliance costs for small firms would be toward the lower end\nof the estimates range (ie, in the region of £800 per year). The assessment concluded that\n\"given the extent to which the tax will fit in with existing practice\", implementing waste\nmanagement regulations and accounting for VAT to Customs, \"the cost of complying with\nthe tax should be very low.\" It went on to note that the two main policy alternatives to a tax\n- tighter regulation, or requiring the industry adopt alternative practices - \"would be against\nthe spirit of the Government's deregulation initiative and would be less economically efficient\nthan using a market-based approach.\"95\nConsultation has marked the history of the new tax. Initially it was proposed that company\ndirectors should be jointly and severally liable for any landfill tax due from their company.\nIn effect, directors would be personally liable for the tax. The use of this power - employed\nin the betting and gaming field - had been thought appropriate since landfill companies would\nhave few assets in cases of insolvency, and - certainly in relation to inactive waste - the tax\ncharge could represent a high percentage of the total value of any transaction.96 With a much\nhigher proportion of the tax at risk in such cases, the Government had thought making\ndirectors responsible would be a good solution, but following strong opposition, it withdrew\nthis provision.97 Moreover, in February, Customs emphasized that to begin with it would\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n94 Standing Committee E 8.2.96 c.171\n95 Compliance Cost Assessment - Landfill Tax CCA 6/95, November 1995 p.9, p.11\n96 In Committee David Heathcoat-Amory gave the example of a site charging £1 per tonne for inactive waste,\nso that the £2 tax charge represented 200% of the original charge: Standing Committee E 8.2.96 c.191\n97 ibid c.192\n35\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\napply penalty rules for tax collection sympathetically:98\nThe Department will take a sympathetic view of genuine errors made as a result of\nunfamiliarity with or misunderstanding of the tax provision during its first year.\nHowever, Customs reserve the right to assess the duty properly due, when considering\nwhether to impose penalties and interest. Similar arrangements were made during the\nintroduction of insurance premium tax and air passenger duty. This means operators\nwill not be penalised for a first default in the first year, unless it was thought that\ndeliberate evasion or manipulation was involved.\nIn a pamphlet on environmental taxes published by the Institute for Public Policy Research,\nthe authors praised the long consultation process that had shaped the final design of the tax:99\nThe new landfill tax is a good model of how a tax ought to be introduced. It was\nannounced in 1994, details were announced in 1995 and, following extensive\nconsultation, it is being implemented in 1996. The consultation was genuine, and the\ndesign of the tax has been totally altered as a result (it will be based on weight rather\nthan being ad valorem as the Government originally proposed). This is a new\ndeparture, not only for environmental policy, but for British tax policy generally.\nAgain all political parties have supported it, as have all environmental groups. Even\nbusiness has not complained too much, although there has been some lobbying on\nwhat should constitute inert waste and so be liable for a lower rate.\nThe Government's goals for the new tax were restated by the Environment Minister, James\nClappison, in a press notice issued on the eve of its introduction:100\nThe landfill tax represents a significant new policy. The shift from taxing\nemployment to taxing resources has rightly been an aim of the EU but it is the UK\nthat is setting the pace. It marks an important step in extending the use of economic\ninstruments to achieve environmental objectives. The central purpose of the tax is to\nensure that landfill costs reflect the full cost of the environmental impact of the\nactivity. By doing this business and consumers are encouraged, in a cost effective\nand non-regulatory manner, to produce less waste, and to reuse or recover value from\nmore waste.\nOf course, the purpose of the tax as a revenue raising device should not be ignored. A\nwritten answer in April 1996 gave estimates for the amount of money the Government\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n98 HM Customs & Excise press notice, Landfill tax - Government meets industry concerns, 13 February 1996\n99 Stephen Tindale & Gerald Holtham, Green tax reform - pollution payments and labour tax cuts, Institute for\nPublic Policy Research, 1996 p.25\n100 HM Customs & Excise press notice, Less waste - more jobs, 30 September 1996\n36\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nexpects to collect:101\nMr. Sheerman: To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what is the\ncurrent estimate of the revenue to be expected from the landfill tax;\n(2) what is his estimate of the revenue available for environmental trusts\nfrom the landfill tax;\nMr. Heathcoat-Amory: The estimated net revenue yield from landfill tax\nis £450 million in a full year. However, because precise figures about the\namount of waste sent to landfill are not available centrally, the revenue\nestimate for the tax is open to a greater than usual margin of error. The\nestimate assumes that credits of tax amounting to £50 million will be given\nto site operators in respect of voluntary contributions they make to\nenvironmental trusts, although, on the basis of the revenue projection for the\ntax and the maximum credit entitlement, as much as £100 million is\npotentially available for trusts in a full year.\nSome critics of the tax have suggested that the absence of precise figures on the amount of\nwaste going into landfill sites is telling, and that it is by no means certain that the new impost\nwill achieve any of the goals the Government has set for it.102 This question is examined in\nmore detail in the following section of this paper.\nIV What effects will the tax have?\nA. How much money will it raise?\nThe Government's position remains that the revenue from the tax will be around £450 million\nin a full year and around £110 million in the six months of its operation in 1996/97103. There\nhas never been any question, however, that these are extremely approximate figures. For two\nmajor reasons HM Customs & Excise will remain unsure of exactly how much will be\ncollected until the tax has been fully operative for a length of time.\nFirst, and of most significance, are the uncertainties concerning the amount of waste going\nto landfill. It was agreed in meetings between the Department of the Environment and HM\nCustoms & Excise that revenue forecasts would, of necessity, be based on the Department of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n101 HC Deb 30.4.96 cc 436-437W\n102 See, for example, \"First green tax is 'a shot in the dark'\", Independent on Sunday, 29 September 1996\n103 HC Deb 31.10.96 c.775\n37\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nEnvironment's estimates of the amounts of waste landfilled in around 1990104. These\nestimates, summarised in section II, suggest that around 125 million tonnes of wastes eligible\nfor the tax are landfilled annually. In translating estimates of landfilled waste into estimates\nof tax revenue the Government have assumed that much of the 44 million tonnes of landfilled\nconstruction and demolition waste will be inactive and therefore charged at the lower rate of\n£2 per tonne, as will some of the 50 million tonnes of landfilled industrial waste. The vast\nmajority of household and commercial wastes will be active and liable to the higher rate of\n£7 per tonne105. \nThe basis of the revenue estimates is itself somewhat doubtful; the Department of the\nEnvironment accepts that106:\n\"much of the needed information [on waste management] is not readily available at\npresent, or is available with insufficient precision to enable reliable estimates ... to be\nmade\".\nIndeed, until the Landfill Tax is fully operative, accurate data on the amounts of waste going\nto landfill will remain unavailable. Consequently, HM Customs & Excise describe their\nrevenue forecasts as best estimates within a range of possibilities107. This is true even in\nterms of the uncertainties surrounding estimates of landfilling in 1990. There is also the\nadded complication of changes in the level of landfill in the subsequent six years. \nThere have been suggestions that the Government's estimates of the amount of waste going\nto landfill are outdated and may overstate the actual annual amount of landfilled waste by as\nmuch as 30 million tonnes108. Some limited data in this area are available for waste\n(household and commercial) collected by waste disposal authorities. Figures for the 50\nWDAs (around half of all WDAs) who reported their landfilling activities to CIPFA in both\n1992/93 and 1994/95 show a collective fall of around 10% in the amounts sent to landfill,\nfrom around 15.7 million tonnes to just over 14 million tonnes109. While these WDAs may\nnot be representative of all WDAs, and certainly the figures are in contrast to those for\nScotland (see page 10) which show an increase of 25% in the landfilling of all controlled\nwaste over a two year period, the figures suggest the possibility of a declining tax base.\nSecond, there is the question of behavioural changes in response to the imposition of the tax.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n104 source: HM Customs & Excise, 7 November 1996\n105 HC Deb 19.12.95 cc 1100-1101W\n106 Department of the Environment (DoE)/Welsh Office, Making waste work : a strategy for sustainable waste\nmanagement in England and Wales, Cm 3040 December 1995 p.17\n107 source: HM Customs & Excise, 7 November 1996\n108\n\"First Green Tax...\", Independent on Sunday, 29 September 1996\n109 CIPFA, Waste Disposal Statistics 1992-93, 1994-95 Actuals\n38\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nBecause, again, of the uncertainties surrounding landfill data, HM Customs & Excise have\nnot been able to incorporate an accurate estimate of the reduction in landfilling consequent\non the introduction of the tax into their revenue estimates. In practice110:\n\"the price elasticity of demand for landfill [will] depend on the suitability and\navailability of alternative waste management practices. This will vary to some extent\nacross the country and between different types of waste. It will also vary over time\nas the practices of waste producers and handlers change to reflect policies contained\nin the [Government's] waste strategy.\"\nToo little is known about each of these factors for any reliable projection of behavioural\nchanges to be made. Given, moreover, the unreliability of their basic revenue projection, HM\nCustoms & Excise believe that the introduction of a further complicating variable would be\nfruitless. In any case, the views of a number of commentators111 suggest that the behavioural\neffects of the tax are likely to be minimal in the short term at existing rates.\nB. What effect will the tax have on local authorities?\nThe concerns raised by local authorities during the consultation on the tax (summarised in\nsection III above) focused on the additional costs they will have to pay to landfill household\nwaste. The tax will be levied on the operators of landfill sites who, in turn are expected to\npass it on to their customers including local authorities. While local authorities will be able\nto recover the cost of landfilling commercial waste directly from their customers, the cost of\nlandfilling domestic waste will have to be met from their own resources. The Government\nargue that they have made provision for additional local authority expenditure in 1996/97\nthrough the local government financial settlement for this year112 and that the cost in future\nyears will be offset by the reduction in national insurance contributions113. Nevertheless, they\naccept that local authorities as a whole will spend more on the tax than they save through the\nreduction in contributions114.\nOnce again, estimates of the impact of the tax on local authorities are beset by the lack of\nknowledge on how much waste they landfill. As a whole the local authorities of England and\nWales have budgeted for £74 million of expenditure on the tax in 1996/97, and in a full year\nare expected to spend around twice this amount, £143 million115. This is slightly higher than\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n110 HC Deb 19.12.95 cc 1100-1101W\n111 See, for example, the views of the Environmental Services Association and the Friends of the Earth,\nsummarised at page 43\n112 HC Deb 29.2.96 cc 1099-1106\n113 HC Deb 19.12.95 cc 100-101W\n114 HC Deb 23.1.96 c.170\n115 CIPFA, Finance and General Statistics 1996-97; \"A waste of a tax?\", The Independent, 9 October 1996\n39\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nthe Government's estimate, based on the assumption that local authorities are continuing to\nlandfill around 18 million tonnes annually, almost all of which is active waste liable for the\n£7 rate of tax, of £126 million for local authorities across the UK116. The Association of\nMetropolitan Authorities suggest a figure of around £154 million117.\nThe cost to individual local authorities will depend upon their existing use of landfill and the\navailability of alternative management methods. The non-metropolitan authorities who,\nbecause of the availability of land, have tended to make greater use of landfill than their\nmetropolitan counterparts are likely to face particularly large bills. If authorities continue to\nlandfill to 1994/95 levels, the average cost for a non-metropolitan authority could be as much\n£1.7 million in a full year, compared with around £0.9 million for a metropolitan authority118.\nKent County Council, for example, may face a bill in the region of £5 million if they\ncontinue to landfill at a similar level as in 1994/95, when they landfilled some three-quarters\nof a million tonnes of household waste119. Surrey County Council have already estimated\ntheir likely full year expenditure at around £3 million120. In most cases, however, the non-\nmetropolitan authorities have a larger taxbase from which to finance their expenditure. \nIt has been suggested that this year's expenditure of £74 million in England and Wales has\nbeen met through cuts in other areas of local authority budgets121:\n\"A similar figure, £73 million, has been cut this year from councils' highway and\ntransportation budgets ... Philip Ramsdale, executive director of the Institute of Public\nFinance (the commercial arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and\nAccountancy), who oversaw the research, says that though linking the cuts to new\nenvironmental spending commitments is simplistic, it does give a reasonable\noverview. 'It may well be that this is not a conscious approach in individual\nauthorities, but in overall terms that seems to be what is happening', he says.\" \nFor 1997/8 the concern is that, in the absence of any compensatory grants from the\nGovernment, the full cost of the landfill tax, net of the offsetting reductions in national\ninsurance contributions, will have to be met through a combination of service reductions and\ncouncil tax increases. While it is accepted that local authorities will pay more in tax than\nthey will gain through the reduction in contributions, the precise net impact is not known.\nOn the basis of the figures produced by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, however,\nthe £154 million cost of the tax would be offset by a £60 million reduction in national\ninsurance contributions, leaving local authorities to find more than £90 million in a full year.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n116\n HC Deb 19.12.95 cc 1100-1101W\n117\n\"Landfill levy will raise council tax\", Daily Telegraph, 16 September 1996\n118 CIPFA, Waste Disposal Statistics 1994-95 Actuals\n119 CIPFA, op.cit.\n120\n \"A waste of a tax?\" The Independent, 9 October 1996\n121 ibid\n40\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nAssuming that the full burden is passed on to council taxpayers, this would be equivalent to\nan increase of around £5 for a band D taxpayer122.\nBeyond 1997/98, the burden on local authorities and council taxpayers will, of course, depend\nlargely on the extent to which local authorities are able to find alternative methods of waste\nmanagement. A further factor is the possibility of increases in the rate of the tax, a scenario\nwhich some commentators believe to be inevitable so long as the tax rate is below the level\nat which landfill becomes more expensive than alternative methods. Paul Ekin, of the\nindustrial forecasters Cambridge Econometrics, believes that the Government will\nprogressively increase the rate of the tax once it is established123. Tony Hammond, chairman\nof the local authority recycling advisory committee goes further, suggesting that:124\n\"Everybody is expecting the Chancellor to increase the amount of the landfill tax in\nthis year's Budget. Realistically, I think we can expect a Landfill Tax of £20 a ton\nwithin two or three years, whichever party is in power\".\nIf tax rates are indeed increased there is no guarantee that there will be further compensatory\ncuts in rates of national insurance contributions. The link made between contributions and\nthe tax in this year does not signify a permanent hypothecation of tax revenues, but was a\npresentational link; a future chancellor would not be obliged to put any additional tax\nrevenues into reducing contribution rates125. Local authorities are therefore likely to have to\nmeet the cost of any future increases in tax rates in full.\nC. What impact will the tax have on waste disposal?\nThe imposition of a landfill tax has been generally welcomed by environmentalists; it has\nbeen one of the obvious candidates for green taxation126. The announcement that the tax\nwould be weight-based was also welcomed. The alternative was an ad valorem tax (see page\n25), but this was opposed by environmental groups who feared that it would encourage\ndisposers to drive further, to cheaper less well-run sites. There is debate, however, about\nwhether the tax will have the desired effect and significantly reduce the amount of waste\ngoing to landfill:127\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n122\n Association of Metropolitan Authorities, cited in \"Landfill levy will raise council tax\", Daily Telegraph, 16\nSeptember 1996\n123\n\"Landfill tax only the start...\", Construction News, 10 October 1996\n124\n\"Landfill levy will raise council tax\", Daily Telegraph, 16 September 1996\n125 Stephen Tindale & Gerald Holtham, Green Tax Reform ..., Institute for Public Policy Research, 1996 p.76\n126 for example Stephen Smith, \"Greening\" the tax system in Britain and Germany, Institute for Fiscal Studies\nan Anglo-German Foundation Report, 1995\n127 Stephen Tindale & Gerald Holtham, Green tax reform - pollution payments and labour tax cuts, Institute for\nPublic Policy Research, 1996 p.94\n41\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\n\"The landfill tax is an important and welcome innovation, the first new tax introduced\nfor genuine environmental reasons in the UK. But it is deficient in three respects.\nFirst, it is too low, and is unlikely to alter significantly the amount of waste going to\nlandfill. The Government should have announced that the £7 rate was a first\ninstalment, and that there would be annual increases until the tax had a more\nsubstantial incentive effect. This would have sent a clear signal to waste producers,\nwithout inducing a sudden jump in their costs.\" \nThe same commentators call for a higher rate tax band for special waste and for a tax to be\napplied to all waste disposal, with perhaps incineration attracting a lower levy. \nPrior to the announcement of the rates of duty to be charged on landfill, the Institute for\nFiscal Studies was not hopeful that the tax would affect the amount of landfill significantly:128\nCrucially, the success of the policy relies on the government choosing an appropriate\ntax rate that adequately reflects the costs of landfill. In general, the social costs of\nlandfill will depend upon the nature of the waste. Inert waste such as building rubble\nwill result in little environmental degradation relative to toxic substances.\nExternalities will also vary with location of the landfill site. Waste deposited in urban\nlandfill sites need not be transported as far as waste generated in rural areas and so\nthe social costs of rural landfill generally tend to be higher than those of urban\nlandfill. Externalities associated with landfill without energy recovery129 have been\nestimated by the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment\n(CSERGE) as being around £3.50 per tonne in urban areas and £4.00 in rural areas,\nalthough these figures should be interpreted with caution since they do not include\nother significant impacts on the community such as noise, odour, unsightliness, etc.\nAlthough it would be appropriate for tax rates to capture differences in externalities,\nthis is likely to increase both administration and compliance costs. In view of this,\nthe Chancellor is expected to announce two rates, a lower one for inert waste and a\nhigher one for more environmentally damaging waste. It is likely that the higher rate\nwill be at least £4 per tonne if it is to reflect the external effects of landfill ...\nIn addition to increasing the tax burden on industry, the proposed levy will also have\na significant impact upon local authorities that are responsible for the collection and\ndisposal of all household waste and some commercial waste. IFS estimates for\nEngland suggest that local authorities' total waste disposal costs will increase by\napproximately £87m. Of this, around £40m will be paid purely on the collection of\ndomestic waste. Assuming that there will be no corresponding increase in grants from\ncentral to local government to help ease the burden of the levy, and that increases in\ncosts occurring from the collection of domestic waste will be purely borne by\nhouseholds and not businesses, then a tax of £5 per tonne will, on average, lead to an\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n128 Institute for Fiscal Studies, Options for 1996 : the Green Budget, October 1995 pp 88-89\n129 Some landfill sites have the facilities to recover methane from deposited waste.\n42\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nincrease in B and D council taxes of around £3.80 per year.\nBy itself, the landfill levy is unlikely to have a significant impact upon the amount\nof waste generated. Whilst the current system of charging for domestic refuse\ndisposal is incorporated into council tax bills, there will be no incentive for\nhouseholds to reduce waste. Consequently, if the government is to reach its target of\nstabilising the production of household waste at its 1995 level, it will be necessary to\nintroduce further measures.\nNor do environmental groups and the waste management industry appear certain that the tax\nwill significantly affect the reliance on landfill by those disposing of rubbish:130\nThe Environmental Services Association, the trade body which represents waste\ncollection companies, said yesterday that the tax would add to costs and push up\ncouncil tax bills. Friends of the Earth, however, said the tax was not high enough to\nachieve its objective of reducing the amount of rubbish dumped in landfill sites. 'It's\na small green step in the right direction. But it won't really work,' said FoE\ncampaigner Mike Childs. On this point the two sides agree. ESA chairman and chief\nexecutive, Peter Neill, said: 'I am sceptical whether isolated economic instruments will\nbe enough to encourage sustainable waste management.'\n... FoE cites a study for the Government by consultants Coopers & Lybrand which\nestimated that the current level of tax will increase recycling by only 1 per cent. It\nwants the tax set at a minimum £30 per tonne and it wants that sum also levied on\nincineration, to avoid the levy diverting waste from landfill sites to incinerators, which\nit believes are dangerous and do not encourage sustainability. The industry is\nconcerned that now the tax is in place, the sum could easily be increased by a hard-up\nChancellor, just like tax on booze or cigarettes. And it argues that a hefty landfill bill\nwill increase illegal fly-tipping. There is not even agreement on the greenest part of\nthe plan - the creation of Environmental Trusts, financed by up to 20 per cent of the\ntax revenues. Everyone agrees they are a good thing, but FoE worries that they will\nbe supervised by a regulator largely controlled by the industry ...\nWhile one view is that the levy could or should be progressively raised, another is that its\nusefulness may eventually wane, as landfill regulation and controls tighten. In their report\nfor the DoE, Coopers & Lybrand said that one of the reasons for introducing a landfill levy\nwas:131 \n\"...to cover the external (environmental) costs associated with landfill that are not fully\nreflected in the existing pricing structure - for example, landfills generate methane\nwhich contributes, inter alia, to global warming, leakage from decomposing waste can\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n130\n\"Green tax fails to please anyone\", Guardian, 1 October 1996\n131 Landfill costs and prices... , NS 8852 February 1993 p.3\n43\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\ndamage water courses and there may be disturbance costs from waste delivery and\nodour - insofar as ever tightening regulation of landfill operations will internalise\nthese costs, the justification for a levy may also diminish.\"\nCoopers & Lybrand argued that a levy would be unlikely to have any significant effect on\nthe amount of waste being landfilled in the short term132 and that incineration would be likely\nto remain an attractive option throughout England and Wales; recycling was expected to be\nrelatively unattractive even with a levy set at £20 per tonne. \nThe 1993 DoE report Externalities from Landfill and Incineration133 - which examined the\nenvironmental case for a levy - pointed out that the externalities associated with incineration\nand landfilling were fairly obvious (disamenity, litter, noise, smell, local disturbance, local\nand global pollution and transport effects) but difficult to express in monetary terms.\nNevertheless the report indicated that a levy in the range of £5-8 per tonne of controlled\nwaste landfilled would reflect the international benefit of air pollution displacement from\nenergy recovery; and £3-6 would be appropriate if only the UK benefit were taken into\naccount. Importantly, the report was not intended to estimate the size of a levy as such:\n\"Government may wish to bring various considerations other than the size of the externality\ninto the setting of a levy.\" \nAs mentioned above, Friends of the Earth have called for the landfill tax to be set at £30 per\ntonne and for incineration and other forms of waste disposal to be covered as well134. FoE\nScotland has described the landfill tax as a 'missed opportunity' which will have some\nnegative effects in making incineration more attractive; a waste tax on the other hand would\nhave encouraged recycling. FoE Scotland has also pointed out that with the different costs\nof landfill around the country, the charge might be little noticed in the South-East or London\nwhere landfill costs are already high, but could double the cost of landfill in Scotland.135 The\nchairman of the Recycling Advisory Group Scotland has called the landfill tax \"correct in\nprinciple but flawed in practice.\"136\nThe managing director of 3C Waste, one of Britain's largest waste management companies,\nhas called the landfill tax a 'disaster' which will raise disposal costs for all businesses and\nhouseholds and \"worse still, encourage fly-tipping in our hedgerows and on remote land and\nroadside verges.\" The tax is, he feels, not aimed at the real polluters who use unlicensed\nlandfill sites, falsify licenses or already dump rubbish illegally, and nor can alternatives, such\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n132 op.cit.\n133 CSERG Warren Spring Laboratory and EFTEL for the DoE, Externalities from landfill & incineration,\nDep.9876 1993\n134\n\"New tax won't dump but fails to fill recycling gap\", Guardian, 5 October 1996 \n135\n\"Landfill tax 'will act as catalyst'\", Herald, 29 November 1995 p.2\n136\n\"New landfill levy seen as burden on councils\", Scotsman, 29 November 1995\n44\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nas recycling, be developed quickly enough without real markets.137 \nOn the other hand, the managing director of UK Waste, the company which released the\nresults of its survey of landfill sites in 1994 (see page 19) has said the landfill tax will act as\n\"an important catalyst for waste minimisation, recovery, and recycling in the UK\" by\ndramatically raising the cost of waste disposal by landfill and giving waste producers a\nfinancial as well as environmental incentive to seek ways to reduce the amount of waste\nwhich they send to landfill.138\nThe Institute of Wastes Management has suggested that the landfill tax will be 'not very'\nsignificant: \"the majority of waste will still go to landfill and life as we know it will go on.\"\nThe reasons for this include the fact that some large companies have told landfill operators\nthat they do not intend to pay the increased landfill rates and are expecting operators to\nabsorb the tax if they want their business. If operators decline to do this, 'cowboys' will be\nwaiting to offer their services. The IWM says that with regard to recycling, 'many leading\nfigures' have predicted that it will provide very little spur. The point is also made that many\nincinerators are having to close at the moment because they do not meet modern emission\ncontrol standards.139 Indeed, in their report,140 Coopers & Lybrand pointed out that\nincineration capacity would not be great enough until the end of the decade to realise the\npotential switch from landfill to incineration.\nD. What role will environmental trusts have?\nThe 1993 Coopers & Lybrand report141 on landfill suggested that one possible although not\nattractive reason for a landfill levy could be to provide a clean up fund for managing later\nenvironmental difficulties which might arise. A system of Environmental Trusts was first\nsuggested in the landfill tax consultation paper142 as a means of providing tax rebates for\nlandfill operators making payments to trusts for specified environmental improvements. This\nwould reflect the environmental impact of landfill and further encourage the development of\nalternatives. The payments made will be limited to restoration of closed landfill sites (or\ndamage caused by such sites) when liability is unclear, research into and development of new\nwaste technologies, or pilot projects for waste minimisation, recycling, composting and energy\nrecovery. At the time of the November 1995 Budget, it was announced that site operators\nwould be able to claim a rebate of 90 per cent of their annual contributions, up to a maximum\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n137\n\"Landfill tax will be a disaster in Cheshire\", Wastes Management, August 1996 p.23 \n138\n\"Landfill tax 'will act as catalyst'\", Herald, 29 November 1995 p.2\n139\n\"IWM Comment: Taxing times, but for who?\", Wastes Management, September 1996 p.4\n140 DoE, Landfill costs and prices ..., NS 8852 February 1993 p.vi\n141 op.cit. p.2\n142 HM Customs and Excise, Landfill Tax: consultation paper, Dep/3 1341 21 March 1995 pp 11-12\n45\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nof 20 per cent of their landfill tax bill in any given year.143 The Secretary of State for the\nEnvironment, John Gummer, has said that the trusts will \"strengthen the environmental\ncredentials of the landfill tax\" and have the potential to generate up to about £100 million of\nprivate sector expenditure for environmental improvement.144\nA working group chaired by the DoE and including the waste management industry, other\nindustries that landfill their own waste, the CBI, environmental groups involved in waste\nmanagement and land remediation and local authority associations was established to decide how\nthe trusts would operate. The activities in which trusts may be able to become involved, subject\nto approval by the Government, include:\n    • research into, and development of, more sustainable waste\nmanagement practices and the provision of education, information\nand support for innovative projects (examples here might include\nresearch into new technology, pilot projects or training schemes\naimed at waste minimisation, re-use, recycling, composting and\nenergy recovery);\n     • collection and dissemination of information about waste management\nand more sustainable waste management practices;\n     • remediation, restoration and amenity improvement of sites which are\nnot able to support economic or social use due to past waste\nmanagement or other industrial activities (providing that no benefit\naccrues to a person who caused or knowingly permitted the\nenvironmental damage or is anyway liable for its remediation); and\n    • provision of environmental, amenity and recreational facilities in the\nvicinity of landfill sites, eg creation of habitats, wildlife and\nconservation areas.\nThe trusts will be non-profit distributing bodies within the private sector and when they were\nannounced it was made clear that HM Customs & Excise would approve a regulatory body\nto monitor the scheme's operation and audit the trusts' expenditure. This body, the\nEnvironmental Trust Regulatory Body Ltd, or Entrust, was launched in October 1996.145\nEntrust is a private sector body which will enrol environmental organisations as approved\nbodies to receive funding from landfill operators. Entrust will have a ten-strong board of\nwhich five members have so far been announced; its chairman will be the Earl of\nCranbrook146.

But Lord Cranbrook said that the executive's experience of the landfill\nindustry would be advantageous. 'We have to regulate and decide priorities in the\nenvironmental field. Many of these landfill operators do see themselves as working\nfor the environment,' he said. 'I am chairman of Shanks & McEwan's advisory board.\nIt has given me quite wide experience of the sort of things that might arise from\nlandfill sites. But we are quite separate from Shanks & McEwan.' \nFor its part, the Institute for Fiscal Studies was unenthusiastic about the prospective impact\nof environmental trusts, in its discussion of landfill tax published in its Green Budget in\nOctober 1995:148\nA second feature of the government's proposals is that landfill businesses are to\nreceive tax rebates on money they pay into environmental trusts, approved by\ngovernment, involved in the restoration of closed landfill sites or research and\ndevelopment into sustainable waste management practices. It is envisaged that rebates\non payments would never be more than 90%. This should ensure that firms will have\nan incentive to check that their payments are being used carefully. Although the\nwaste disposal industry has broadly welcomed the idea of environmental trusts, the\nmeasure can be interpreted as a move towards hypothecation, albeit under a different\nname, and over the long term, these rebates may also be a somewhat unsustainable\npractice. From an environmental perspective, the main purpose of the tax is to reduce\nthe amount of waste going to landfill, but at the same time the rebates are to be used\nto promote long-term objectives such as research and development and restoration of\nold landfill sites. However, it is expected that revenues from the tax should dwindle\nover time as firms adopt alternative measures for waste disposal, and so this will\nundoubtedly constrain the government's ability to fund future rebate payments.\nFurthermore, since it is essentially the private sector rather than government that will\nbe responsible for the trusts' activities, these new environmental expenditures will not\nappear in the public finances.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n147\n\"Industry links taint green tax\", Observer, 29 September 1996\n148 Options for 1996 : the Green Budget, October 1995 p.89\n47\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nE. The cut in National Insurance Contributions (NICs)\nWhen he announced the introduction of landfill tax in his 1995 Budget speech, Kenneth\nClarke proposed that the money raised by the new tax would be used to cut National\nInsurance Contributions (NICs): \"The money raised by the landfill tax will allow for a\nmatching cut in the main rate of employers' national insurance contributions by a further 0.2\nper cent to 10 per cent from April 1997. That will cut the cost of employment by half a\nbillion pounds and will make it cheaper for businesses to create new jobs.\"149\nThe authors of a recent pamphlet on environmental taxes published by the Institute for Public\nPolicy Research applauded the principle at stake in cutting NICs:150\nThe concept of a green tax reform is not nearly as widely debated in the UK as in\nmany other European countries, but it has been gaining support gradually in recent\nyears. Conservative Chancellor Kenneth Clarke signed up to the principle when he\nlinked the new landfill tax to a reduction in employers' National Insurance\nContributions, saying: \"I want to increase the tax on polluters, and make further cuts\nin the tax on jobs\". (The Treasury subsequently pointed out that this was not\nhypothecation but a presentational link - a future Chancellor is not obliged to put any\nextra revenues from the landfill tax into reducing NICS). However, the landfill tax\nraises a comparatively small amount of money, around half a million pounds a year,\nso the shift cannot be said to be significant, and the 1995 Budget contained no new\ntaxes on polluters ...\nSome concern has been expressed by trade unionists about the weakening of the\ncontributory principle if employers' National Insurance Contributions are reduced\n(although it is perhaps worth remembering that radical trade unions opposed the\nintroduction of National Insurance when Lloyd George proposed it in 1911, arguing\nthat benefits should be paid out of general taxation). The contributory principle is a\nfiction    National Insurance Contributions are not nearly large enough to cover what\nthey are supposed to fund. The notion that employers should take responsibility for\nsome aspects of their employees' well-being is a noble sentiment, and in an age of full\nemployment or labour scarcity would be worthy of strong support. Sadly, in an age\nof mass unemployment when public policy makers need in effect to induce employers\nto take on more workers, it appears something of a luxury. What matters to\nindividuals, in this context, is that they have a job and that there is a decent welfare\nsystem. The way in which the revenue is raised to finance the welfare system is\nsurely a second order concern, and it must be sensible to organise the tax system in\na way which maximises employment.\nIn any case, opposition to reductions in employers' NICs should not be taken as\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n149 HC Deb 28.11.95 cc 1063-1064\n150 Stephen Tindale & Gerald Holtham,  Green tax reform ... Institute for Public Policy Research 1996 pp 76-78\n48\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nopposition to the concept of green tax reform, only as opposition to one variant of it.\nThe revenues could equally be used to cut income tax, business rates, corporation tax\nor VAT.\nHowever, in its Green Budget published in October 1995, the Institute for Fiscal Studies\nargued that the cut in employer NICs would be unlikely to have much of an effect:151\nThe tax, imposed at a rate of £3-5 per tonne, would raise in the region of £300-500m\nper annum, permitting a reduction in the main rate of employer NICs of 0.2\npercentage points or a larger cut in the lower rate of employer NICs. Presumably, the\nuse of revenues from the landfill levy to reduce employment taxes is an application\nof the 'double dividend' arguments discussed earlier. However, this initiative must\nlargely be seen as cosmetic. Piecemeal changes are likely to have little impact overall\n(particularly since in this case even a tax rate of £5 per tonne, approximately 50% of\ncurrent average landfill prices, will only lead to small reductions in NICs). Indeed,\nthis measure raises the question of why the Chancellor has decided to use revenues\nfrom the landfill levy in this way when there would be much more scope to reduce\ndirect taxes by using the revenues from other 'green' tax measures such as petrol taxes\nor VAT on domestic fuel and heating. Furthermore, although reductions in NICs are\nlikely to be welcomed by industry across the board, the measure will not, in many\ninstances, be particularly beneficial to those industries likely to bear the largest burden\nresulting from the tax since many of these (particularly steel-making and electricity\ngeneration) tend to be capital-rather than labour-intensive.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n151 Options for 1996 : the Green Budget, October 1995 pp 88-89\n49\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nV Landfill abroad\nA.

It already exists in Denmark,\nthe Netherlands, France and parts of Belgium and I understand that the\nItalians are proposing to introduce such a tax. In general, the rates of those\ntaxes are above what we are proposing ... This is not an environmental\nEuropean tax. We have no desire to harmonise such tax rates throughout\nthe European Community. We are introducing it in this country because it\nsuits British conditions and it is good for the environment. Also, we can\nrelieve taxation on employment [by cutting the rate of employer's NICs].\nEach of the countries with a landfill tax already in force (Belgium, Denmark, France and the\nNetherlands) disposes of less than half of their municipal waste to landfill. Denmark has had\na landfill tax since 1986, which has increased from approximately £5 per tonne to a planned\n£33 per tonne in 1997. The Netherlands has a landfill tax of around £12 per tonne, and\nFrance a waste storage and industrial waste tax of £5154.\nIn Denmark particularly the introduction of a landfill tax, together with progressive increases\nin its rate, has coincided with a marked decline in levels of waste sent to landfill. In 1985,\nprior to the introduction of a tax, around 1.4 million tonnes of municipal waste, around 63%\nof all municipal waste, was landfilled by Danish municipalities155. In 1993, only around 0.5\nmillion tonnes of municipal waste went to landfill, around 20% of the total.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n152 Waste collected by municipalities. The figures in the table showing total waste generated are not a reliable\nindicator of absolute levels of waste generation, since the waste responsibilities of municipalities will differ\nbetween countries. The table does, however, offer a broad comparison of disposal routes.\n153 HC Deb 23.1.96 c.165\n154 Green tax reform..., Institute for Public Policy Research, 1996 p.30\n155 Eurostat, Environment Statistics 1989, Tables 9.2 and 9.4\n51\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nB. European developments in landfill legislation\nA draft Landfill Directive - 93/7506/EEC - was first proposed by the European Commission\nin 1990. The UK's main objection concerned its proposed ban on co-disposal.156 The\nGovernment was also concerned by the suggestion that all landfills should be routinely\nmonitored.157 Germany, France, Belgium, Italy and Luxembourg stated that they expected the\nDirective's conditions to, in effect, bar landfill without pre-treatment to ensure that stable\nresidues only were landfilled for 'long-term safety'.158 (The Royal Commission on\nEnvironmental Pollution in its report Incineration of Waste159 recommended pretreatment of\nlandfill waste by incineration to reduce the long term risks of pollution, greenhouse gas\nproduction, risk of leaching, and volume of landfill by up to 90%.) \nIn their contribution to the Royal Commission's report, Aspinwall & Co commented on the\nlikely effect of the Landfill Directive:160\n\"The siting of a landfill site is already a complicated process but it is bound to\nbecome even more difficult in the future. The latest draft of the EC Landfill Directive\nproposes to include restrictions in terms of proximity (not less than 5000 metres) to\nroads, recreational areas, houses, waterways or agricultural sites. Clearly this doesn't\nleave much room for new development ... The UK tradition of refilling voidspace left\nby quarrying works may ease the impact of this new restriction, but in the long term\nthe consequence will be that landfills will become fewer, and subsequently more\nvaluable.\"\nIn May 1996 however, the European Parliament, on the recommendation of the Environment\nCommittee's rapporteur, rejected the common position on the draft Directive (445 votes to 18,\nwith 22 abstentions).161 MEPs felt that the Directive did not go far enough, in that it did not\nban an indefinite perpetuation of co-disposal. It also included the possibility of exempting\nsmall landfills in mountainous or sparsely populated areas from control. This had been\ninserted at the insistence of Ireland and Portugal and meant, said the rapporteur, that half the\nland area of the Community might possibly be excluded from the scope of the Directive.162\nBecause the Council of Ministers had adopted its common position by qualified majority\nrather than unanimity (France and Belgium wanted the Directive to go further) the\nParliament's vote effectively killed the Directive, as the rapporteur acknowledged, calling for\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n156 Europe Environment, 14 June 1994 p.1\n157 Landfill of waste; European standing committee A 2 February 1994, HMSO\n158 ENDS Report, September 1994 p.18\n159 Cm 2181 May 1993\n160 op.cit.

The Commission's communication suggests that all waste\ngoing to landfill should be pre-treated. There is no sound scientific basis to this\napproach. Landfill when properly engineered and controlled is a viable waste\nmanagement option for a range of wastes.\nThe United Kingdom favours the disposal of untreated biodegradable waste to landfill,\nand the use of the biochemical process engineering - bio-reactor - approach to manage\nlandfill sites. This approach is designed to prevent pollution caused by the\ndegradation process, and to provide conditions in the landfill in which stabilisation of\nthe waste in situ is as rapid as possible. The approach is based on research into\nlandfill practices that the [DoE] has sponsored for more than 20 years.\" \nThe Commission is expected to publish a new proposal for a Directive 'in the next few\nweeks'. The UK has undertaken to oppose any provisions requiring the pre-treatment of all\nwaste going to landfill.166\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n163 UNEP/Inter-Parliamentary Union, Environmental Notes for Parliamentarians, June/July 1996\n164\n\"EC waste policy up in the air as MEPs reject landfill Directive\" ENDS Report 256, May 1996 pp 38-39\n165 HC Deb 16.10.96 cc 1060-1061W\n166 HL Deb 31.10.96 c.28WA\n53\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nVI Further reading\nDepartment of the Environment, This Common Inheritance - Britain's environmental strategy,\nCm 1200 September 1990\nRoyal Commission on Environmental Pollution, Seventeenth report - Incineration of waste,\nCm 2181 May 1993\nDepartment of the Environment, Government response to the Seventeenth report..., July 1994\nDepartment of the Environment, Landfill costs and prices: correcting possible market\ndistortions, NS 8852 February 1993\nDepartment of the Environment, Externalities from landfill & incineration, Dep.9876 1993\nDepartment of the Environment, Economic instruments and recovery of resources from waste,\nDep.8701 1993\n\"Environmental taxes\" in Institute for Fiscal Studies, Options for 1996 : the Green Budget\nOctober 1995 pp 81-90\nDepartment of the Environment, Making waste work : a strategy for sustainable waste\nmanagement in England and Wales, Cm 3040 December 1995\nHM Customs & Excise, Landfill tax - a consultation paper, March 1995\nHM Customs & Excise, Landfill tax - report on responses received to consultation paper,\nSeptember 1995 \nHM Customs & Excise press notice, Budget 1995: Landfill tax - using market forces to help\nthe environment, 28 November 1995 \nHM Customs & Excise, Compliance cost assessment - Landfill tax CCA 6/95, November 1995\nRoyal Commission on Environmental Pollution, Nineteenth Report - Sustainable Use of Soil\nCm 3165 February 1996\nStephen Tindale & Gerald Holtham, Green tax reform - pollution payments and labour tax\ncuts, Institute for Public Policy Research, 1996\nEnvironment Agency, Landfill restoration and post-closure management - consultation draft,\nWaste management paper 26E August 1996\nHM Customs & Excise press notice, Less waste - more jobs, 30 September 1996\n54\n\n\n\n"

This paper presents up-to-date\nresidence-based unemployment rates not published elsewhere for all 651 constituencies in the\nUK, using figures for the number of unemployed claimants from the monthly count and data\nfor the economically active population from the 1991 Census of Population. \nIn May 1996 the Office for National Statistics moved to a 1991 ward base for the\nunemployment statistics. This means that for many constituencies it is no longer possible to\nmake direct comparisons with previously published data. As a result, this Paper no longer\nincludes a table on changes in the level of unemployment in recent years. Research Paper\n96/63 provides a guide to the methodology and to which constituencies are affected by the\nchange in the geographical base.\nJane Dyson\nEconomic Policy Alison Penman\n& Statistics Section Statistics Resource Unit\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n                                                                   \nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not published elsewhere. These use figures for the number of unemployed\nclaimants from the monthly count and figures for the number of people economically active\nderived from the 1991 Census of Population. \nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour, as they take no account of people's ability to seek work outside the constituency\nin which they live. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nthe Research Paper 96/63.\nThe data contained in this Paper are generally not comparable with figures published in this\nseries of Papers of this series prior to May 1996. This is because in May 1996 the ONS\nchanged the geographical basis of the monthly claimant count. Previously, the monthly\nfigures have related to parliamentary constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1981 wards.\nFrom the April 1996 figures onwards, data are based on constituencies defined in terms of\nfrozen 1991 wards. Whilst figures for January, February and March 1996 were re-released\non the new basis, back-runs of figures for dates prior to 1996 will not be published. For\nmany constituencies therefore, there will be a discontinuity in the figures at the end of 1995.\nFor this reason it is no longer possible to produce tables showing the change in the number\nof claimants 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ago. \nNotes to tables:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The\nfollowing abbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\nVAC Vacant seat\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/105\n2. The data from the 1991 Census of Population used for the denominators in calculating\nresidence-based unemployment rates were obtained from the dataset known as the\nLocal Base Statistics. In the case of the Censuses for England and Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland, the raw data relate to areas known as \"Enumeration Districts\".\nThese data are first aggregated into electoral wards and then wards are aggregated to\nform constituency totals. In Scotland the raw data relate to \"Output Areas\". These\nfigures are not available at a ward level but are aggregated directly into higher level\ngeographical areas such as constituencies and districts.\nThere is inevitably a time-lag between changes in electoral ward boundaries being\nincorporated into parliamentary constituencies. This means that wards are not always\ncoterminous with constituencies. Where this is the case, wards have been best-fitted\nto constituencies on the basis of the constituency where the majority of the population\nare thought to live.

The Social Security Administration\n(Fraud) Bill was presented on 15 November 1996 and is due to be debated on Second\nReading on 25 November 1996.\nBenefit fraud is currently estimated to cost the taxpayer £3 billion a year. Various initiatives\nhave been introduced to detect and prevent fraud; the in-year detection target for 1996/97 is\n£1.8 billion.1 The Government has stated that the first aim of this Bill is 'to ensure that fraud\ninvestigators have the tools they need to catch those who cheat the benefit system and to\nensure that fraudsters pay'.2 The Bill will:\n remove barriers to comparing information held on different databases for the purpose of\npreventing, detecting and investigating fraud;\n introduce a range of penalties for claimants who give false information to get benefit;\n ensure that those who conceal information, as well as those who make false statements, can\nbe effectively prosecuted;\n make it easier to prosecute people who make fraudulent attempts to get a National\nInsurance number.\nThe second stated aim of the Bill is to improve local authorities' performance in the\nadministration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. In this area the Bill will:\n enable the establishment of an inspectorate to monitor anti-fraud work in housing and\ncouncil tax benefits which are administered by local authorities;\n introduce powers to make directions to local authorities to improve their performance in\ntackling housing benefit fraud.\nParts II and III of this paper give general background on benefit fraud (housing benefit fraud\nis dealt with separately); part III sets out the Bill's provisions in detail and includes comment\nfrom interested organisations.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 DSS Fraud Bill - Background Briefing for Queens Speech, 23 October 1996\n2 ibid\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nII Social Security fraud in general\nA. The extent of fraud and anti-fraud initiatives\nThe extent of social security fraud is estimated to be around £4 billion in the current year, of\nwhich around £1 billion is detected.3\nResearch carried out by the Benefits Agency suggests fraudulent claims of income\nsupport/unemployment benefit, housing and council tax benefits account for the bulk of fraud\nactivity. Evidence from surveys suggests around £1.5 billion is being overpaid in income\nsupport and unemployment benefit (often associated with failure to declare income, capital\nor changes in status such as living together as husband and wife).4 A further £1 billion is\nreckoned to be being overpaid in housing benefit.5\nIn July 1995 the Secretary of State for Social Security announced a five-year strategy to give\nmore emphasis to the prevention and deterrence of fraud and error. This aims to increase the\nsecurity of the benefit process by:\n increasing control at the point of entry to the benefit system;\n improving control throughout the life of benefit claims;\n improving security and control at the point of benefit payment; and\n minimising weaknesses in the design of benefits.\nIn 1995/6 detected fraud savings amounted to £1.4 billion. £716 million in benefit fraud was\nstopped by over 400,000 investigations and £507 million was saved through initiatives such\nas data matching, bar-coding and scanning of order books, extra visits and checks on new and\nexisting claims. Benefit fraud stopped by local authorities accounts for the remaining\n£222 million.6\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 Financial memorandum to the Bill\n4 BA Security Benefit Review (Income Support & Unemployment Benefit) June 1995\n5 DSS press notice Jan 1996, \"Billion Pounds Housing Benefit Fraud Revealed\"\n6 DSS press notice, Fraud savings hit new high, 5 August 1996\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nThe categories and details of detected fraud savings are:\n1994/5\n£m\n1995/6\n£m\nIndividual benefit fraud 599 638\nMultiple identity fraud 6 11\nMethod of payment fraud* 68 55\nOrganised method of payment fraud*,\nsecurity control programme savings\n(eg new claims visits, data matching,\nbar-coding of order books) 24 507\nBenefit savings by local authorities 171 222\nTotal 889 1,444\nCriminal prosecutions 9,546 10,677\nArrest in Organised Fraud 1,336 1,207\n     * Savings from stopped method of payment fraud are now recorded under the\nSecurity and Control Programme savings.\nProjects implemented in the first year of the strategy to reduce weakness and risks in the\nbenefit system include:\n New claim visits. Since July 1995 benefit claimants have been visited prior to award to\nverify their circumstances.\n Targeted reviews. Verification of customer circumstances during the life of benefit\nclaims.\n Generalised matching.

Post Offices fitted with a scanner to read the bar code on benefit\norder books can check the status of books prior to encashment. This prevents encashment\nfrom reported lost or stolen books.\nOther security measures and anti-fraud activities implemented include:\n The fraud referral hotline. This was piloted in a number of areas and enables the public\nto pass on information about alleged benefit fraud; it was launched nationally in August\n1996.\n Post Office rewards scheme. This rewards Post Office staff who prevent encashment of\nfraudulent instruments of payment.\nMeasures to be implemented during the current financial year include:\n Further data matching (the current bill provides for more inter-departmental matching).\n More Benefit Reviews (to ascertain the nature and scale of fraud) so far research has been\npublished to estimate the scale of fraud in income support and unemployment benefit,\nhousing benefit and invalid care allowance.\n Increase in visits and reviews of claims.\n Introduction of benefit payment card (full implementation in 2-3 years).\n Action to tackle employers who collude with employees who work while continuing to\nclaim unemployment benefits.7\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n7 Social Security Departmental Report Cm 3213\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nB. Types of fraud\nBenefit fraud occurs in four main areas:\n Misrepresentation of household circumstances - either through incorrectly notifying the\nBA at the point of claim or failing to notify during the period of the claim.\n Misrepresentation of financial circumstances - either through incorrectly notifying the\nBA at the point of claim or failing to notify during the period of the claim.\n Identity - where claimants are not who they say they are and are not in fact entitled.\n Security of payments - When instruments of payment (order books and girocheques) are\nstolen, manipulated or counterfeited to obtain payments to which there is no entitlement.\nAccording to the Benefits Agency, fraud investigation work suggests the great majority of\nfraud occurs through misrepresentation of household or financial circumstances.8\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 Benefits Agency Security Strategy, Five Year Programme Against Fraud and Abuse \n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nIII Housing Benefit/Council Tax Benefit \nA. The extent of fraud\nExpenditure on Housing Benefit (HB) has doubled in real terms since 1988; projected\nexpenditure for 1996/97 is £11 billion.

The report11 estimated that the total annual\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n9 Social Security Departmental Report Cm 3213 March 1996 , Social Security Departmental Report Cm 2813 March\n1995, DSS The Growth of Social Security 1993\n10 Social Security Select Committee, Housing Benefit Fraud, 1 May 1996 HC 90-I 1995-96 para 20\n11 Housing Benefit Review - Main Stage Report\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nvalue of HB lost as a result of error or fraud could exceed £1 billion; of this total it was\nestimated that fraud would account for over £900 million. The Social Security Select\nCommittee's report, Housing Benefit Fraud, which was published in May 1996,12 is critical\nof this estimate because of the methodology employed by the DSS:13\n'Much more serious than the failure to detect these individual frauds is the Report's almost complete absence\nof evidence on organised or collusive frauds, particularly landlord fraud. This absence of evidence can be\npartly explained by the passive nature of the exercise, based on checking existing information rather than on\ninvestigation. The difference between checking information and investigating fraud is fundamental but the\nawareness of this difference is not widely understood, let alone acted upon. The Committee has been told that\nif investigative techniques are used a high level of fraud is detected in the private rented sector.'\nThe Committee concluded that the true total of HB fraud could possibly be as high as £2\nbillion14 but the Government has rejected this suggestion:15\n'The Housing Benefit Review was a carefully planned, statistically sound study which involved unannounced\nvisits to claimants in their homes by trained fraud investigators. Its design was endorsed by the National Audit\nOffice. The Review estimated the scale of Housing Benefit fraud to be of the order of £1 billion. No other\nstudy has ever been carried out in this country with a similarly rigorous methodology. The Government is\nsceptical, therefore, about the view of the Local Authority Investigation Officers Group expressed to the\nCommittee that Housing Benefit fraud could amount to £2 billion, and notes that no supporting evidence was\nprovided for it.'\nOn 14 November 1996 the Audit Commission published an update to its report Protecting the\nPublic Purse: Ensuring Probity in Local Government16 in which it states that '[housing]\nbenefit fraud continues to be the major probity issue facing local government.'17 It found that\nthere were 162,000 proven fraudulent cases in 1995/96 involving losses of £55 million; this\nrepresented over 5 times as many detections as there were five years before.\nFollowing the Government's announcement of its intention to bring forward a Bill to combat\nsocial security fraud during the Queen's Speech on 23 October 1996, the London Housing\nUnit (LHU) issued a Press Release in which it laid the blame for the increase in HB fraud at\nthe Government's feet:18\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12 HC 90-I 1995-96\n13 ibid para 49\n14 ibid para 6\n15 Housing Benefit Fraud: Reply by the Government to the Third Report from the Social Security Select Committee\nSession 1995-96 Cm 3299 June 1996 para 6\n16 The first Audit Commission report of this title was published in 1993.\n17 para 12\n18 LHU press notice, Government policy leads to benefit fraud, 25 October 1996\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n'The high level of rents has made fraud a much more lucrative proposition for unscrupulous private landlords.\nThey were able to make claims for housing benefit for tenants who did not exist and for dwellings that were\nunoccupied.\nLettings in the private sector were far more vulnerable to fraud than those in the public sector ... In the case\nof council housing, the local authority is able to check immediately from its other records who is occupying\na property. According to LHU research, the cost of housing benefit to the Exchequer is now running at four\ntimes the level it was in 1988, the last year before private sector rents were deregulated by the Government. \nLHU analysis shows that barely one pound in every four of this increase [in housing benefit expenditure] is\ndue to a rise in the number of privately rented properties for which housing benefit is paid. The great bulk\nof the increase comes purely from an increase in rents.'\nB. Types of fraud\nStudies into HB fraud have noted that it can be committed in a variety of different ways; the\nlist below, taken from the Social Security Select Committee's report,19 illustrates the many\nways in which HB fraud can be perpetrated:\nProperty based fraud:\nResidence:\n claimant not resident at given address\n failure to report change of address\n claimant only resident long enough to set up claim (this may involve redirection of mail)\n sub-letting and moving on\nRent/tenancy:\n overstating rent payable (either individually by the tenant or collusive inflation of rent so\nlandlord and tenant split the proceeds\n fictitious sub-tenancy\n landlord is fictitious\n home owner is purporting to be tenant (at own home or another address)\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n19 HC 90-I 1995-96 para 52\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n landlord is a close relative\nMultiple:\n claims for benefit by claimant using multiple identities\n claims for benefit by claimant using multiple addresses\nLandlord:\n fictitious tenancy (claim for benefit where no tenancy exists)\n confirmation by landlord that tenant still in residence even though he has moved out\n claims for empty properties\n abuse of right to buy scheme with the property being bought then setting up tenancies with\noriginal tenants as private tenants\nAgents:\n agents with no legal standing (ie not authorised by the owner) increaseing rent levels or\nnumber of tenants\nLarge scale organised fraud:\n of various types including where a business or family own a number of properties and\nmove 'tenants' in and out with such regularity that tracing becomes impossible. Properties\nmay be registered under false names to confuse investigators.

Anti-fraud initiatives\nHB has been administered by local authorities on behalf of the DSS since 1983. As with all\nbenefits, an important objective of the delivery system is to ensure that all those entitled to\na benefit receive the correct amount; local authorities have a statutory responsibility to ensure\nthat their systems do their best to meet this objective. The Social Security Select Committee's\n1996 report commented that: 'During the 1980s there appears to have been little coherent\nstrategy to prevent, deter or detect Housing Benefit fraud'.20 In practice, until 1993 the\nsubsidy system in operation penalised authorities for detecting fraud as these payments were\ntreated as overpayments which attracted a lower rate of subsidy. Recent years have seen\nconcerted efforts by central and local government to combat fraud.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n20 ibid para 30\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n1. Financial incentives\nBy way of an incentive to authorities to be vigilant in regard to potentially fraudulent claims\nthe DSS introduced a scheme in April 1993 whereby authorities could share in any savings\nachieved above and beyond their share of a national baseline (originally set at £100 million\nand increased to £150 million from April 1996).21 These incentives were strengthened in\nApril 199622 so that authorities can now receive 10 per cent additional subsidy on savings\nabove three quarters of their share of the national threshold and 25 per cent (previously 20\nper cent) on savings achieved in excess of their share of the national threshold. The threshold\nis distributed according to each local authority's share of national HB/Council Tax Benefit\n(CTB) expenditure.\nIn April 1994 subsidy reductions were introduced for authorities achieving less than 50 per\ncent of the £100 million threshold in order to encourage those who were perceived as doing\nlittle to combat fraud. In 1993/94 local authorities saved around £90 million; this increased\nto £171 million in 1994/95 and £222 million in 1995/96. In the last financial year around 90\nper cent of authorities (421) received bonus payments as a direct result of their efforts to curb\nfraud;23 a total of £28 million in extra subsidy was earned in 1995/96 as a result of the\nincentive scheme.24\nThe introduction of the incentive scheme was generally welcomed by local authorities. In\nJanuary 1995 the DSS published an analysis of the operation of the scheme25 the main\nfindings of which are summarised in the Social Security Committee's Report as follows:26\n the proportion of authorities with no fraud staff in place had decreased from 28 per cent\nto four per cent since the implementation of the scheme in April 1993;\n 80 per cent of local authorities expected to better their performance in the second year of\nthe scheme compared to the first year;\n the majority of authorities (77 per cent) agreed that in dividing up the national baseline,\nthe level of benefit expenditure should be used while a similar proportion (79 per cent)\nthought that such data should be weighted to reflect factors that varied between authorities;\n there was evidence of different methods being used to calculate benefit savings;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n21 This initiative was referred to as 'Action Against Fraud'.\n22 Following the publication of the Housing Benefit Review - Main Stage Report.\n23 DSS press notice, DSS cracks down on organised fraud by London landlords, 15 May 1996\n24 HC Deb 12 November 1996 c.195W\n25 Local Authority Anti-Fraud Incentives\n26 HC 90-1 1995-96 para 32\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n there was widespread agreement that the formula took no account of preventive or deterrent\nwork.\n2. National register\nFollowing publication of the Housing Benefit Review in January 1996 the Secretary of State\nfor Social Security, Peter Lilley, announced the creation of a national register of Housing\nBenefit and Council Tax Benefit (to be operational from July 1996) with a view to matching\ndata across local authorities against departmental fraud detection systems:27\n'There are currently 475 local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland. They administer Housing Benefit and\nCouncil Tax Benefit individually on different, unconnected IT systems with no interface with Benefits Agency\nIT systems. The Central Register will provide comparison of information, detection of inconsistencies and\nidentification of fraud. It will be able to match data within and across local authorities and against DSS systems\nto detect fraud and inconsistencies.'\n3. Challenge funding\nThis initiative, also announced in response to the Housing Benefit Review - Main Stage\nReport, has involved making up to £10 million available from April 1996 'to enable local\nauthorities to develop innovative ideas to tackle fraud'.28 Authorities may bid for funds with\nwhich to implement new schemes; successful schemes are to be publicised to encourage\nadoption by other authorities. The finance for this scheme has been re-directed from local\nauthorities' administration grants.\n4. Audit Commission\nIn January 1996 the Secretary of State announced that the Government intended to work\nclosely with the Audit Commission to tighten up local authority methods of preventing\nfraudulent claims getting into the system.29 \nThe Audit Commission's auditors have been working with local government in London to\ndevelop computer techniques for detecting fraud. Its 1996 report30 notes that the London\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n27 DSS press notice, Billion pound benefit fraud revealed, 19 January 1996\n28 ibid \n29 ibid\n30 Protecting the Public Purse: Ensuring Probity in Local Government, 14 November 1996 para 13\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nTeam Against Fraud detected fraud worth £3 million using these techniques in 1995/96; by\n1997 it aims to extend these techniques to all councils in England and Wales as part of the\nNational Fraud Initiative (NFI). \nThe Commission is carrying out a joint study into HB with the National Audit Office (NAO)\nwhich is designed to review the arrangements to deter, identify and investigate fraud. The\nNAO is to report to Parliament on the effectiveness of the DSS's measures to encourage local\nauthorities to combat fraud, including subsidy incentives and anti-fraud training. The\nCommission intends to publish a report and handbook describing best practice, aimed at those\nin local government who administer HB.31\nThe Audit Commission is also participating in a joint study with the Benefits Agency on co-\noperation between the Agency and local authorities in preventing and detecting fraud. The\nCommission is involved in the formation of the London Organised Fraud Investigation (see\nbelow).\n5. Fraud teams\nAs concern about HB fraud grew during the 1990s a number of local authorities developed\nsome local initiatives. In 1993 the Finance Directors of London Boroughs formed the London\nCommittee for Action Against Fraud which funds the London Team Against Fraud. In 1994\nthis Team set up a Housing Benefit Central Register to match HB data across 33 London\nBoroughs. In 1991 local authority fraud investigators formed a national group, the Local\nAuthority Investigation Officers Group. A separate group, the London Boroughs Fraud\nInvestigators Group was formed in London. The aim of these groups is to raise the profile\nof local authority fraud issues and provide training and support to their members.\nIn May 1996 the Social Security Fraud Minister, Oliver Heald, announced the creation of the\nLondon Fraud Investigation Team (LOFIT) comprising six specialist teams of up to 20 local\nauthority investigation officers. LOFIT is to focus on:32\n organised HB fraud conducted across more than one London borough;\n liaison with the Benefits Agency, Police, Crown Prosecution Service, London Team\nAgainst Fraud and other relevant organisations;\n landlord surveillance;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n31 ibid\n32 DSS press notice, DSS cracks down on organised fraud by London landlords, 15 May 1996\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n promotion of good practice in preventing and detecting fraud.\n6. Response to the Social Security Select Committee's Report\nIn response to the Committee's May 1996 report Peter Lilley announced three new anti-fraud\nmeasures including:33\n The setting up of a cross-governmental committee to formalise the co-ordination of\nmeasures to tackle fraud;\n The relaxation of restrictions on the sharing of information between the Inland Revenue\nand DSS officials for the purpose of identifying potential fraud;\n Discussions to take place with the Royal Mail over access to the database of redirected\nmail to assist in tackling multiple identity and other frauds involving false addresses.\nIII The Bill and detailed comment\nA. Supply and use of information (Clauses 1-4)\nThe general aim of these clauses (1-4) is to improve the detection of certain types of benefit\nfraud by allowing data provided to certain government departments to be compared with data\nheld by the DSS in order to identify inconsistencies. Local authorities will be allowed to\nexchange and pass on data to assist in the prevention and detection of fraud and to promote\nthe efficient administration of HB and council tax benefit (CTB).\nProvisions for the exchange of information between government departments for social\nsecurity purposes are currently covered by section 122 of the Social Security Administration\nAct 1992 and section 116 of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992.\nThese relate solely to information held by the Inland Revenue. They state that any obligation\nof secrecy on the part of the Inland Revenue cannot prevent the disclosure of information held\nin connection with the assessment or collection of income tax to officials of the DSS. The\ninformation must be in connection with the collection and assessment of national insurance\ncontributions. Once information is disclosed to the DSS, the department is as bound as the\nInland Revenue not to disclose that information further, unless it is to be made available for\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n33 DSS press notice, New Ministerial anti-fraud group announced in response to Social Security Select Committee\nReport, 5 June 1996\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nthe purposes of civil or criminal proceedings in relation to contribution law, the Jobseekers\nAct 1995 or the determination of a question by the Secretary of State.\nThere is currently no provision to enable information held by Customs and Excise to be\ndisclosed to the DSS. However, as the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise are\nauthorised to disclose to each other information which is relevant to the other's duties it has\nbeen suggested that some information which is passed to the DSS by the Inland Revenue\ncould have originated from Customs and Excise34.\nFor self employed people paying schedule D tax, the information that can be disclosed to the\nDSS is restricted to that which is sufficient to identify the person undertaking the work,\ndetails of when that person commences or ceases self employed work and to certain\ncircumstances when the responsibility for the assessment of Class 4 contributions has passed\nfrom the Inland Revenue to the DSS.\nThe department has been developing its investigative methods for detecting fraud with an\nincreased use of information technology. The Generalised Matching Service (GMS) has been\nin operation since April 1995. It takes benefit data from internal Benefit Agency computers\nand matches that information against specific rules to identify inconsistencies. In this way\nthe system generates referrals for fraud officers to investigate and according to department\nfigures has led to £29m in savings in 1995/635. There have also been attempts to extend the\nworking cooperation between government departments with regard to the disclosure of\ninformation36.\nClause 1 of the Bill will replace section 122 of the 1992 Act and proposes to extend the\nprovision for the disclosure of information. The Bill stipulates that information held by the\nInland Revenue and Customs and Excise may be passed to the DSS:\n'for use in the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of offences relating to\nsocial security;\nor\nfor use in checking the accuracy of information.'\nThis is more directive than the 1992 Act which merely states that the passing of certain\ninformation cannot be prevented. Under the Bill's proposals as long as it can be used for the\nabove, there are no restrictions on the information which can be disclosed. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n34 Tolley's, National Insurance Contributions, 1996-7 p.348\n35 DSS press notice, Fraud savings hit new high, 5 August 1996\n36 Inland Revenue press notice 94/137, 1 September 1994, DSS press notice 95/118, 19 September 1995\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nThe new Section 122(3)(c) will allow for information passed on from the Inland Revenue and\nCustoms and Excise to be disclosed further to local authorities for the purpose of detecting\nand preventing council tax benefit or housing benefit fraud. The calculation of CTB and HB\nis partly dependent on the level of social security benefits to which a claimant is entitled.\nThe new Section 122A will allow information held by the Inland Revenue to be disclosed to\nthe Contributions Agency and re-enacts existing provisions. The Contributions Agency is the\narm of the DSS which maintains and checks people's National Insurance contribution records.\nHowever, unlike information passed from the Inland Revenue to the DSS, it was not thought\nnecessary to allow for this to be disclosed further to local authorities and this is not provided\nfor.\nClause 2 extends the provisions to include information held by people working for other\nGovernment departments. Subsection (1)(a) covers information which relates to \"passports,\nimmigration and emigration, nationality or prisoners\" and would allow for this to be given to\nthe DSS for the same purposes as outlined for Inland Revenue information above. A\nclaimant's immigration status and nationality can affect their entitlement to benefits as this can\nbe dependent on residence or immigration-status. The Bill would allow DSS officials to\ncheck the information received from a claimant with that held about them by the immigration\nauthorities.\nConcern about prisoners stems largely from people failing to inform the authorities when they\nhave gone into custody and their claim for benefits has fraudulently continued. This issue\nwas raised in a parliamentary question in 1994 and Alistair Burt, then Parliamentary Under\nSecretary of State for Social Security, outlined the measures that were being newly undertaken\nat that time to combat this type of fraud:37\nIn response to the continuing problem of benefit fraud amongst prisoners new controls were introduced on 4\nMarch. The Prison Service now provides the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service with a weekly\nlist of all newly convicted prisoners in England and Wales. This will ensure that all benefit recipients have\ntheir case reviewed on entry to prison.\nThe provisions in the Bill would extend these controls to cover all prisoners including those\non remand.\nSubsection (b) covers information which relates to \"any other matter prescribed\". This\neffectively means regulations could be laid which would allow for any Government\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n37 HC Deb 16 March 1994 c.709W\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\ndepartment to be covered by these provisions. The definition of Government departments for\nthe purposes of this Bill is:\n'a person providing services to a Minister of the Crown or a government department\n(including a Northern Ireland department)'\nThus, anyone who comes under this definition could in the future come under the terms of\nthe Bill and be required to pass information to the DSS which could assist in preventing or\ndetecting benefit fraud. This information could then be disclosed further to local authorities\nto help with the detection of CTB or HB. Similar provisions are included in the Bill to cover\nthe use of other government information in Northern Ireland to be made available to the DSS.\nThe Government believes the new rules will remove unnecessary barriers to the effective\ndetection and prevention of social security fraud.\nWhilst recognising the need to ensure benefit fraud is tackled effectively some respondents\nto the Bill feel that the increased powers it would provide need to be balanced by safeguards\nto protect people's privacy. Justice, a campaign group for human rights and legal reform,\nbelieve the Data Protection Act would provide inadequate protection and advocates a\nstatutory code of practice relating to data matching between government departments.\nClause 3 adds a new section (122C) to the Social Security Administration Act 1992 to allow\nthe Secretary of State or the Northern Ireland (NI) Department to supply information relating\nto HB or CTB to local authorities for use in the administration of those benefits and requires\nauthorities to have regard to this information when administering them. \nAs clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill provide for the supply of information held by tax authorities\nand other government departments to the Secretary of State or the NI Department, the effect\nof clause 3 is to enable this information to be supplied to local authorities for use in the\nprevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of offences relating to HB or CTB, or to\ncheck the accuracy of information relating to HB/CTB claims. \nThe clause allows the Secretary of State or NI Department to impose conditions on the use\nof such information and to charge a fee for supplying it. Further disclosure of the information\nis to be prevented except in certain limited circumstances.\nAdditionally, clause 3 inserts a new section (122D) into the 1992 Act to enable the Secretary\nof State or NI Department to require local authorities, and other bodies authorised to exercise\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nthe HB/CTB functions of an authority, to supply information relating to benefit administration\nor policy to the Secretary of State or NI Department. The manner and form of information\nsupplied under this section may be prescribed.\nClause 3 also inserts a new section (122E) into the 1992 Act to enable the Secretary of State\nand NI Department to authorise local authorities to supply information relating to benefit\nadministration to other authorities for use in the prevention, detection, investigation or\nprosecution of offences relating to HB/CTB or for maintaining and improving the accuracy\nof information relating to those benefits.\nClause 4 extends the provisions in Schedule 4 to the 1992 Act that set out who may commit\nthe offence of unauthorised disclosure of social security information to cover local authority\nmembers, officers and employees, local authority contractors and their employees, local\nauthority inspectors and local government ombudsmen and auditors.\nB. Administration of HB and CTB (Clauses 5-10)\nClause 5 inserts a new section (139A) in the 1992 Act to enable the Secretary of State to\nauthorise persons to consider and report to him on the administration of HB and CTB by local\nauthorities with particular reference to the prevention and detection of fraud. These\n'authorised persons' will have rights of access, at any reasonable time, to any documents and\ninformation relating to the administration of benefits. They will also be entitled to an\nexplanation from any person accountable for documents, or involved in benefits\nadministration, and to require it to be given in person. Any person who fails, without\nreasonable excuse, to comply with such a requirement imposed by an authorised person will\nbe guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on\nthe standard scale(£1,000).\nA report to the Secretary of State made under this section by an authorised person may\ninclude recommendations about improvements that could be made by an authority in terms\nof benefit administration, with particular regard to the prevention and detection of fraud.\nLocal authorities will receive copies of these reports as and when they are sent to the\nSecretary of State.\nThe effect of clause 5 will be to give power to a national inspectorate to monitor anti-fraud\nwork by local authorities. An inspectorate could be set up under existing social security\nlegislation but it would lack the powers that the Bill is seeking to introduce. \n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nThe local authority associations have questioned the need for such an inspectorate on the\ngrounds that only 27 out of 400 authorities were below their fraud targets in 1995/96; Paul\nLautman of the Association of District Councils (ADC) has been reported as stating:38\n'It's using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, the DSS has already got sufficient means to penalise poor\nperformance. We would have thought there were better ways to invest than in a costly inspectorate.'\nThe associations are concerned about what they perceive as the 'big brother' approach of\ndeveloping an inspectorate with extensive powers; Paul Lautman has commented that local\nauthorities are responsible bodies and that the rationale for a fraud inspectorate is none too\nclear.39 Speaking on behalf of the joint associations Paul Jenks, Chair of the ADC Housing\nCommittee, stated:40\n'Local authorities share the Government's concern about benefit fraud and have made great efforts to tackle\nit. But we are concerned that the powers of this new fraud inspectorate are excessive and unnecessary - the\nmoney would be better spent recruiting local authority fraud investigators to work at the sharp end to combat\nfraud and to ensure that benefit reaches those who are entitled to receive it.'\nClause 6 inserts a new section into the Local Government and Finance Act 1982 to enable\nthe Audit Commission to assist the Secretary of State, on request, in any study designed to\nimprove the administration of HB/CTB by local authorities. Under this provision authorities\nand their officers will be obliged to provide information needed for the conduct of such a\nstudy. The clause also provides for the exchange of information between the Secretary of\nState and the Audit Commission.\nClause 7 makes similar provision in relation to the Commission for Local Authority Accounts\nin Scotland.\nClause 8 inserts a new section into the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (139D) to\nenable the Secretary of State to invite a local authority to consider a report made about its\nadministration of HB or CTB and to remedy any failing identified in it. The clause allows\nthe Secretary of State to make directions about the standards which an authority is expected\nto attain and the time within which they are to be attained. The Secretary of State will have\nthe power to make recommendations about the courses of action that the authority might take\nto achieve these standards.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n38\n\"Government hit squads set to raid LA benefit departments\", Housing Today, 31 October 1996 \n39 ibid\n40 ADC press notice, Local authorities need more resources to tackle fraudsters, say associations, 15 November 1996\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nClause 9 amends section 140B of the 1992 Act, which provides for the calculation of\nsubsidy in respect of HB and CTB, to strengthen the Secretary of State's powers to increase\nor decrease the subsidy paid to local authorities on the basis of their success or failure in\npreventing and detecting fraud. The manner in which these deductions/increases are to be\ncalculated will be specified by Order. The Secretary of State will also be able to deduct\nsubsidy if an authority fails to reach the standards that he has directed them to attain under\nsection 139D (see clause 8).\nThe local authority associations argued against the introduction of an increased detection\ntarget for HB/CTB fraud and associated subsidy cuts from April 1 1996.41 There was concern\nthat many councils would find it difficult to achieve the fraud savings targets set; Paul\nLautman of the ADC has made the following response:42\n'The DSS needs to recognise the need to invest to save. That means up front investment in investigating\nofficers. Councils have already expressed concern that the harsher incentive regime will throw their budgets\ninto turmoil.'\nThe local authority associations are, therefore, opposed to this provision in the Bill which\nimplies further adjustments in subsidy entitlement. They have called for councils to be given\n'a period of stability', and have said that the government is 'tinkering' without waiting to see\nhow far this year's targets are working.43\nClause 10 inserts a new section 110 into the 1992 Act to allow local authorities administering\nHB/CTB to appoint inspectors from among their employees or, with the consent of the\nSecretary of State, the employees of another authority or, from among employees of a\ncontractor acting on its behalf. An appointed inspector will be able to enter business premises\nto make enquiries about any person believed to be a benefit claimant or recipient. Private\ndwelling houses will not be liable to inspection unless there are reasonable grounds for\nbelieving that a trade or business is being carried on from there which is not also being\ncarried on from premises other than the dwelling house in question. The clause places a duty\non the following classes of person to supply information or produce documents if required by\nan appointed inspector:\n(a) persons who occupy premises liable to inspection or persons found by an inspector in\nany such premises;\n(b) persons believed by an inspector to be benefit claimants or benefit recipients;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n41 See page 16\n42\n\"Incentives to tackle fraud come under fire\", Inside Housing, 26 January 1996 \n43\n\"Councils fear moving fraud targets will hit cash incentives\", Inside Housing, 1 November 1996\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n(c) persons believed by an inspector to hold or have access to information or documents\nrelating to a person in (b) above; or\n(d) persons who are employees or agents of a person within any of the paragraphs (a) to\n(c) above.\nIn regard to clauses 8, 9 and 10 CHAR, the housing campaign for single people, has made\nthe following response:44\n If increasing amounts of time and resources are directed towards tackling fraud then the\nefficiency of of other aspects of the HB system, eg calculation and payment of HB, are\nlikely to suffer. We fear that late payments could result, causing problems for claimants\nand landlords.\n If financial penalties and incentives are to be used to encourage local authorities to tackle\nfraud then we feel similar arrangements should be made to make them tackle the problem\nof late payments of benefit.\n We are concerned that the subsidy penalties could also cause over-zealous and cash-\nstrapped local authorities to victimise innocent people.\n If local authorities are constantly on the look out for fraud the culture of suspicion that\ncould arise in benefit offices could lead to large delays in the processing of HB claims and\nclaimants being subjected to excessive scrutiny prior to their being paid their HB.\nC. Offences, penalties and overpayments (Clauses 11-14)\nCurrently, a person attempting to obtain benefit45 is guilty of an offence if he:\n makes a statement or representation which he knows to be false;\n provides documents or information which he knows to be false;\n knowingly causes or allows another person to provide documents or information which he\nknows to be false.46\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n44 CHAR's response to the government's Fraud Bill, 15 November 1996\n45 Benefits covered by S.110 of the SSAA 1992\n46 Section 112 Social Security Administration Act 1992\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nSuch an offence carries a maximum fine of £5,000 (level 5 on the standard scale), or\nimprisonment for up to 3 months, or both. In addition, a person may have to repay any\nbenefit overpaid as a result. This offence is liable for summary conviction only - this means\nit can be tried only in a magistrates  court (in Scotland, a Sheriffs  court).\nClause 11 creates a new, more serious, offence, where a person dishonestly makes a false\nstatement or provides false information or causes another person to do this to gain benefit or\nother advantage under social security legislation. It also makes an offence of failure to notify,\nor causing another person to fail to notify, certain changes of circumstances. These changes\nwill be prescribed in regulations.\nSuch an offence will be triable either summarily (in a magistrates  court) or on indictment\n(in a higher court). A summary conviction can have a fine of up to the statutory maximum,\n(currently £5,000) or imprisonment up to six months, or both. On conviction on indictment,\nthe maximum term of imprisonment is seven years, or a fine, or both.\nThis offence is intended to cover more serious fraudulent offences than the existing section\n112. In England and Wales it will require a person to have acted “dishonestly”, not just\n“knowingly”. In Scotland it will be sufficient for a person to have knowingly made\nrepresentations to obtain benefit for an offence under the new section to have been committed.\nThe reason for the different wording in England and Wales compared with Scotland is\napparently to allow for differences in the two jurisdictions and the DSS intention is that they\nshould have the same effect.\nClause 12 extends the summary offence of obtaining benefit by false representation. A\nperson who makes a statement or representation which he knows to be false is guilty of an\noffence. The clause strengthens this provision and a person who without \"reasonable excuse\"\nfails to report a change of circumstances or causes or allows another person to do so will be\nguilty of an offence. This means that it will be an offence to fail to notify a change in\ncircumstances or knowingly cause or allow another person to do so. The changes in\ncircumstances covered by this provision will be contained in regulations. \nWhere overpayment of benefit has occurred, generally, a person has to have misrepresented\nor failed to disclose a material fact for repayment to be required.47 Failure to disclose a fact\nwould include not telling the Benefits Agency of relevant changes in circumstances. There\nis currently no specific offence of failing to notify a change in circumstances - generally the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n47 Section 71(1) SSAA 1992 \n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nBenefits Agency relies on the wider failure to disclose and sometimes on the\nmisrepresentation provisions to encompass such individuals. Prosecutions of those suspected\nof benefit fraud are used in a very small proportion of cases. While court action is rare, in\nmany cases action the Benefits Agency attempts to recover money overpaid as benefits. This\ncan be done by stopping payment of the same or most other benefits or by enforcement\nproceedings in the county courts. Where recovery is through stopping Income Support, the\nmaximum which can be deducted from weekly benefit is £9.60 if a person has admitted fraud\nor been found guilty of fraud or £7.20 in any other case.\nClause 13 provides for a 30% penalty payment to be made in addition to an overpayment as\nan alternative to court action. This will apply to overpayments of centrally administered\nbenefits and housing and council tax benefit. The imposition of a penalty payment will only\nbe allowed where it appears that the overpayment is attributable to an act or omission on the\npart of an individual and there are grounds for instituting proceedings for an offence in\nrelation to the overpayment. Following written notice by the Secretary of State a person can\nagree to pay the penalty in the same way as overpayments are recouped. No proceedings\nrelating to the overpayment will be instituted against a person agreeing to pay the 30%\npenalty.\nAccording to the DSS, the rate of penalty needs to reflect a level that is high enough to be\nseen as punitive without being set too high so as to provide a disincentive to accepting the\npenalty. The level chosen is comparable to fines imposed by other government departments\nwhen the differing client groups are taken into consideration.\nEstimates accompanying the Bill reckon there will be around 25,000 overpayment penalty\ncases each year of which 5,000 will involve local authorities. For the DSS extra costs are\nestimated at around £3 million per year with anticipated savings of £3.9 million. For local\nauthorities the extra costs will be around £800,000 with up to £1 million collected in\npenalties.\nClause 14 amends section 75 of the 1992 Act, which provides for the recovery of\noverpayments of HB, to allow local authorities to recover HB overpayments from payments\nmade directly to a landlord or his agent in respect of other tenants where, for example, the\noriginal tenant, in respect of whom the overpayment arose, has vacated the landlord's property.\nPayments subject to a deduction in this way will still discharge the liability of the other tenant\nto the landlord. \nWhere overpayments are not recovered by deductions from benefits the clause provides for\ntheir recovery by action in the county court in England and Wales and in the sheriff's court\nin Scotland. This measure will align HB with other social security benefits by allowing a HB\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\noverpayment determination to be treated as a proof of debt which can then be registered as\na court order.\nThe local authority associations have welcomed this extension to their powers to recover\nbenefit overpayments but are disappointed that the Bill will not go further to require the\nregistration of landlords owning more than 20 homes in respect of which HB is payable, and\nto allow the refusal of HB payments where they are not allowed to inspect properties.48\nSpecific measures that the associations would like to see introduced include:49\n a requirement on letting agents to give local councils the name of an owner of a property;\n a power to cease a claim if refused entry to a property;\n a requirement for a register of all landlords who own more than 20 properties.\nThe London Housing Unit, which believes that the main cause of the growth in HB fraud is\nthe ability of private landlords to make uncontrolled rent increases,50 has urged the\nGovernment to put more emphasis on the targeting of these landlords.51\nThe Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA) is concerned that landlords will have\nno automatic right of appeal over the recovery of benefit in this manner and has issued the\nfollowing response to clause 14:52\n'Such arbitrary, tribunal-style justice will cause respectable landlords and their agents to turn away all Housing\nBenefit tenants and leave the housing of such tenants to the unscrupulous who often offer the poorest quality\naccommodation.\nThis will help to defeat the government's avowed intention of enlisting the private rented sector to make up\nthe shortfall in housing association and local authority housing.'\nCHAR, the housing campaign for single people, is of the view that clause 14 could exacerbate\nproblems which already occur where overpayments of benefit are recovered from landlords\nwho cannot recover the money from the tenants concerned because they have moved on.\nCHAR's response to the Bill makes the following points:53\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n48 ibid\n49 ADC press notice, Local authorities need more resources to tackle fraudsters, 15 November 1996\n50 See pages 11-12\n51\n\"Government told to re-route fraud investigations\", Housing Today, 31 October 1996\n52 ARLA press notice, ARLA reaction to DSS Fraud Bill, 18 November 1996\n53 CHAR's response to the Government's Fraud Bill\n29\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n Many accommodation providers could find themselves with cash-flow problems if their\nrental income was reduced. Those most likely to suffer are small housing associations, the\nmany hostels with few resources, and private sector landlords who rely on rent to pay the\nmortgage on the property they rent out.\n Other tenants whose HB is being used to make up the overpayment could be affected.\nAlthough this is not the government's intention, it is possible that landlords will still expect\nother tenants to cover their rents - failure to do so could result in harassment or the\neventual loss of their deposit when they leave the property.\n The widespread discrimination against claimants in the private rented sector will be\nexacerbated by this part of the Bill. One of the major reasons for the current bias is that\nHB problems, ie shortfalls and delayed payments, lead the majority of landlords to seek\nto let to those in work. This change will provide another deterrent to letting to people on\nbenefits. It is particularly worrying as it will have the greatest effect on those landlords\nwho have more than one tenant on benefit.\nD. Reviews and medical examinations (Clauses 15-16)\nDisability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance are benefits available to severely\ndisabled people. The present benefit structure dates back to April 1992 when mobility and\nattendance allowances for people under 65 were replaced by DLA. This is one benefit with\nseparate components for care and mobility. Attendance allowance remains to meet the care\nneeds of those 65 and over. Currently, awards of DLA and attendance allowance can be\nmade for a limited period (with a minimum of 6 months) or for life. Recipients of\nDLA/attendance allowance can apply for their awards to be reviewed and it could be\nadvantageous for them to do so if, for example, their condition has worsened to the extent\nthey would be entitled to a higher rate. An adjudication officer can initiate a review of a case\nwhere there has been ignorance of a material fact, or a mistake, or a change in circumstances.\nDisability working allowance is a tax-free benefit to top-up the earnings of low-paid workers\nwith a disability. Like family credit, it is paid for 26 weeks, usually regardless of changes\nin circumstances.\nClause 15 enables the Secretary of State to initiate a review of these benefits and carry out\ninvestigations to obtain information for that review. It confirms that the Secretary of State\nmay initiate a review of benefit during the course of the current benefit award. The need to\nclarify the law on this point arises because existing provisions allow benefit reviews to be\n30\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\ninitiated \"on an application\". It has been questioned who can make such an application.54\nThis clause makes it clear that, in addition to the claimant, the Secretary of State can review\nbenefit entitlement during the course of an award and that he can undertake investigations to\nobtain evidence to support such a review.\nThese provisions are estimated to cost about £1 million annually, but lead to savings of\naround £3 million.55\nClause 16 gives regulatory powers to the Secretary of State to require existing recipients of\ndisability living allowance and attendance allowance to undergo a medical examination. It\nalso provides for payment of benefit to be withheld if a person fails to attend a medical\nexamination. If benefit entitlement is subsequently confirmed, the clause further allows for\nany withheld benefit to be paid.\nCurrently such powers only exist when an initial claim is being determined.56 Where an\naward has already been made and it is alleged that the person should not or no longer be\nentitled to benefit there is no power to require a person to undergo a medical examination.\nThe clause enables regulations to provide such powers.\nSchedule 1 para 2 amends the Social Security Administration Act so that a referral for a\nmedical examination is no longer for the person who applied for review, but for the person\nin respect of whom the review is being made. If the amendment were not made the\nimplication is that applications for review made by the Secretary of State would require him,\nrather than the benefit claimant, to attend a medical examination.\nThe Disability Alliance have expressed concern that these changes are being made in the\nabsence of any hard evidence of the existence of widespread fraud of either DLA or\nAttendance Allowance. They also believe that existing powers are sufficient to deal with\ncases of fraud and the extension of the powers proposed in the bill could lead to \"fishing\"\nexercises where there is no existing evidence of fraud. The Alliance also believes that the\nregulatory powers given to the Secretary of State in respect of medical examinations should\nbe more clearly defined, particularly they should only be applied where there is evidence of\na change in circumstances.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n54 For example, in Disability Rights Bulletin Summer 1996 \"Disability Living Allowance and Benefits Agency\nInvestigations\"\n55 Financial Memorandum to the Bill\n56 S.54 SSAA 1992\n31\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nE. National insurance numbers (Clause 17)\nA national insurance (NI) number is generally allocated to a person in the year preceding their\n16th birthday and marks the registration of that person within the state social security system.\nPeople who have never been given a number can apply to their local social security office\nwith documentary evidence of their identity such as a passport, EC identity card or Home\nOffice standard acknowledgement letter.\nNI numbers are also used as reference numbers in the national computerised PAYE system\nand the Inland Revenue has transferred names, addresses, dates of birth and titles of\ncontributors from the DSS computer.\n \nThe original purpose of the NI number was to record an individual's contributions but with\nthe increased computerisation of the benefits system, they have become more important in\nmaking claims for social security benefit. However, it is not currently essential to have a NI\nnumber to claim benefits. Legally claimants can receive benefit if they fulfil the conditions\nof entitlement. These vary from benefit to benefit, but possession of a NI number is not one\nof them. However, the Secretary of State (or the officer acting in this capacity) will need\ninformation and evidence in order to ensure that the claimant does satisfy the conditions. In\nparticular he or she will need to be satisfied that the claimant is who they say they are. For\nmost benefits, including income support, the computer systems have a field for the NI\nnumber, so that the claim could not be processed on the computer without this information.\nHowever, provided the officer is satisfied about the claimant's identity, the claim can be\nprocessed clerically. For example, where a claimant needed to apply for a NI number, the\nBenefits Agency office could assist them with this, and also process their income support\nclaim.\nThere has been concern expressed over the past few years about the number of NI numbers\nin circulation and the use of false numbers to perpetuate benefit fraud57. In response to this,\nthe Contributions Agency (the executive agency of the DSS which deals with NI numbers and\nrecords of contributions) is preparing for the introduction of a new recording system which\nis due to be operational by 1997. Staff who allocate NI numbers have also been receiving\nextra training to combat fraudulent applications for NI numbers.58\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n57 Social Security Select Committee Fifth Report, The Work of the Department of Social Security and its Agencies,\n1 November 1995 para 16\n58 Department of Social Security Press Notice, Fraud Savings Hit New High, 5 August 1996\n32\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nGeneral conditions for entitlement to benefit (as opposed to specific conditions for individual\nbenefits) are covered by the Social Security Administration Act 1992, Section 1, and the Bill\ncontains provisions to supplement these.\nClause 17 of the Bill proposes adding to the general conditions for entitlement to benefit by\nmaking it a condition that a claimant, and anybody on whose behalf a claim is being made,\neither has a national insurance number or has the evidence to enable him/her to be allocated\nwith one.\nSection (1B) will require that in order to become entitled to any benefit a claim must be\naccompanied either by:\n a national insurance number and evidence that the number has been allocated to that\nperson; or\n information which will enable the claimant's number to be ascertained.\nIf a claimant does not have a national insurance number they will need to apply for one with\nthe necessary evidence before they can become entitled to benefit. Those without national\ninsurance numbers will usually be those from abroad but people whose parents did not claim\nchild benefit and who have not worked may also come into this category.\nThe evidence required to prove a NI number belongs to the claimant currently depends on the\ncircumstances of the case and will vary according to the DSS officer's view of each case.\nItems which may be required to confirm a NI number, according to the DSS, include wage\nslips, medical certificates and passports. There is a form to apply for a new NI number and\nofficers may ask for a passport to confirm a person's identity. Providing false information for\nthese purposes will be an offence. These procedures will not be altered by the proposals in\nthe Bill but they will become a condition of entitlement to benefit. Concern has been\nexpressed that this amounts to a method of immigration control and this combined with the\nprovisions for exchange of information between Government departments contained in the Bill\nis likely to fuel this concern.59\nSection (1C) allows for regulations to be made which can exempt these provisions from\ncertain benefits, people or \"in other prescribed circumstances.\"\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n59 Child Poverty Action Group, Ethnic Minorities Handbook, 1st Edition, p.104\n33\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nAccording to the Financial memorandum to the Bill, the estimated annual cost of these\nprovisions is £50, 000 but the savings they will produce are \"difficult to quantify\".\nF. Redirection of post and Data Matching (Clauses 18-19)\nThe issue of claimants arranging for their mail to be redirected to enable them to perpetuate\na fraudulent claim was raised by the Social Security Select Committee.60 The Committee was\ninformed that requests from local authorities that mail be returned if it was marked 'Please do\nnot redirect' were ignored by the Post Office. A Post Office memorandum to the committee\nexplained that they were resisting such requests because there were a number of operational\nand commercial implications.61\nIn order to obtain information from the Post Office's address database, DSS and local\nauthority staff must currently apply on a case by case basis showing they have good cause\nto suspect an individual of fraudulent activity.\nClause 18 inserts new sections 182A to the 1992 Act, and 158A to the 1992 Northern Ireland\nAct. These would require social security and local authority mail which would otherwise be\nredirected, to be returned to the sender. Section 182A(2) will allow reasonable payments to\nbe made to the distributor of mail for this service.\nSection 182A(6) makes an exemption for mail which is under a court order to be redirected\nto the trustees of somebody who has been declared bankrupt. Payments issued are redirected\nto trustees to enable them to use the money to repay debtors. \nClause 19 inserts new sections 182(B) to the 1992 Act and 158(B) to the 1992 Northern\nIreland Act. It would enable staff of the DSS and local authorities to have access to the Post\nOffice database which details information of people who have paid for their mail to be\nredirected. This would remove the need to apply on a case by case basis and would enable\nofficers to cross reference people who appear both on their own databases and the Post\nOffice's. They will then be able to investigate why these people are having their mail\nforwarded and if it is being done as part of fraudulent activity. Section 182(B)(4) will allow\nreasonable payments to be made to the Post Office for this service.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n60 Social Security Select Committee Third Report, Housing Benefit Fraud, 1 May 1996 HC90-1 1995-6 para 80\n61 ibid para 82\n34\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nSections 182(B)(5) would prevent the further disclosure of this information to non\nGovernment departments unless it is to be supplied for the purposes of any civil or criminal\nproceedings relating to the Social Security Administration Act 1992, the Contributions and\nBenefit Act or the Jobseekers Act 1995 (or corresponding Northern Ireland legislation). \nSection 182(B)(6) would allow the further disclosure of information to other Government\ndepartments, such as the Inland Revenue and the Home Office, if it has been used to alter\ndetails which may affect that department's dealings with the individual concerned.\nJonathan Bamford, assistant registrar to the Data Protection Registrar, has recently expressed\nconcern that unless data matching techniques are supported by skilled human intervention and\nadequate safeguards, they may result in \"unwanted consequences for innocent individuals\n[which] may undermine the value of such activities\".62\nIn their response to the Bill, the Post Office have highlighted concerns about how both the\nmeasures will affect them as the major distributor of social security and local authority mail.\nWhile they are committed to the fight against benefit fraud, they feel the bill has been\nprepared too hastily and the lack of consultation with the postal service may result in\nproblems with the practical implementation of the measures. They argue these problems\ncould damage the reputation of the Royal Mail. The issues raised by the Post Office are:\n The fact that mail is marked 'do not redirect' will highlight the fact that it may include a\npayment and this has implications for the secure return of such mail. \n it will be practically difficult to distinguish mail redirected to trustees of people who are\nbankrupt and this could result in the Royal Mail failing to comply with a court order.\n innocent individuals who have paid for their mail to be redirected may suffer as a result\nof both measures.\n the reputation of the Royal Mail could be tarnished if they are seen as part of mechanisms\nto disclose personal information to other Government departments.\n the cost implications for the postal service to change operational procedures and how the\ndepartment will evaluate the level of \"reasonable costs\" to finance these changes.\nThe DSS and the Post Office are currently in the early stages of discussions on how these\nmeasures will work in practice and the costs involved. In the financial memorandum to the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n62\n\"A match made in data\", Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation Supplement, 4 October 1996\n35\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nBill, the DSS have estimated the cost of preventing redirection of mail at £250,000 which\nwould result in savings in the region of £1 million. The annual running costs for accessing\nthe postal redirection database are estimated at £400,000 per year leading to annual savings\nin the region of £2.2 million.\nG.

Consequently sterling's trade-\nweighted index has reached its highest level since Jan 1995.\nIt is thought that expectations of lower interest rates in\nEurope as well as a correction on previous valuations on\nsterling may have fuelled the rise. Brokers generally see the\ntrend continuing for some time. \nSource: ONS Database Series AJFH, AJFA, AJHX; Financial Times\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/108\nD 3.

In\nthe three months ended August 1996, the main growth in exports (in value terms) has come from exports\nto EU, with the largest rise being in exports to Germany. This was partially offset by a fall in exports\nto Belgium. Outside the EU, rises in exports to Oil Exporting Countries and the Rest of the World\ncontrasted with falls in exports to other Western Europe, North America and Other OECD Countries.\nIn value terms the main growth in imports has come from North America and Germany. In 1995 the\nenlarged European Union (EU 15) received 58.3% of UK exports and supplied 56.6% of all UK imports.\n* Volume of Trade  (excluding oil and erratics) - In the three months to August 1996, the volume of\nexports and imports both rose 2 per cent compared with the previous three months. Latest estimates of\ntrends show both export and import volumes rising slightly. \n  \n* Trade in oil - The surplus on trade in oil in the three months ended August 1996 was £1.2 billion\ncompared with £1.1 billion in the previous three months. \n* Non-EC countries - The non-EU visible trade deficit in September was provisionally estimated at\n£0.9 billion. Provisional estimates of value (excluding oil and erratics) show exports fell by 1½ per cent\nto £5.9 bn. while imports rose 2½ per cent to £6.8 bn.

          "Personal Tax Allowances & Reliefs\n1997-98\nResearch Paper 96/109\n27 November 1996\nThis paper sets out the main changes to the personal income tax allowances and reliefs\nannounced in the Budget of 26 November 1996. It lists the principal personal allowances\nwhich will be available against tax in the tax year 1997-98, and it outlines the conditions\nnecessary for eligibility for these allowances. As such, the paper provides a summary of the\ngeneral tax position in straightforward cases only. It should be stressed that this paper deals\nonly with tax allowances. No reference is made to cash benefits provided under the social\nsecurity system or to national insurance contributions.\nAntony Seely\nBusiness & Transport Section\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

Rates and Thresholds\nIncome tax is charged at three rates - the lower rate, the basic rate, and the higher rate - on\nthree bands of taxable income. Taxable income excludes personal allowances, which\nrepresent the amount of money someone may receive free of tax. The basic rate of income\ntax will be cut by 1% to 23% for 1997-98. The lower and higher rates of income tax are to\nbe unchanged, and remain at 20% and 40% respectively.\nThe first £4,100 of an individual's taxable income is charged the lower rate for 1997-98. The\nlower rate band has been increased by £200 from £3,900; this is £100 above the increase in\nline with statutory indexation. Taxable income in excess of the lower rate threshold is\ncharged the basic rate of 23%. The upper limit of the basic rate band is increased by £600\nto £26,100 - which is line with indexation - for 1997-98. Taxable income in excess of this\nthreshold is charged the higher rate of 40%. The three tax rates and thresholds for 1997-98\nare summarised below:\nTaxable Income £ Tax Rate\nFirst £4,100 20%\n£4,101 - £26,100 23%\nOver £26,100 40%\nB. Personal Allowances\nThe statutory requirement to uprate personal allowances in line with inflation - the so-called\n\"Rooker-Wise\" amendment - was introduced under section 22 of the Finance Act 1977, and\nis consolidated in section 257C of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act (ICTA) 1988. The\namendment was successfully made through the cross-party co-operation of Jeff Rooker and\nAudrey Wise with Nigel Lawson. All three argued that without indexation, inflation acted\nas an unauthorised, unintended and an unknown increase in taxation; in other words, taxation\n'by stealth'. By ensuring that any real changes in allowances would have to be voted on, the\namendment would ensure changes in the tax structure would be 'out in the open'. At the time\nMr Lawson noted, \"this does not hamstring the Chancellor in any way except to remove a\nbias which is there at present. It alters the political context and it will therefore have real\nconsequences.\"1\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n     \n1 HC Deb 25 July 1977 cc 94-95\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nPersonal allowances should be increased by a percentage equivalent to the rise in the retail\nprice index (RPI), rounded up to the nearest £10; the income limit for age allowances should\nbe increased by a similar proportion but rounded up to the nearest £100. A similar statutory\nrequirement to uprate the lower and the basic thresholds in line with inflation, unless\nParliament determines otherwise, is provided under section 1 of ICTA 1988. In the case of\nthresholds, changes must be rounded up to the nearest multiple of £100.\nWhen uprating the main allowances and thresholds, the relevant inflation rate taken is the\nincrease in the RPI in the year to September. For the year to September 1996, the inflation\nrate was 2.1%.\nThe ordinary personal allowance is to be increased by £280 for 1997-98, £200 more than the\nincrease under statutory indexation. The age-related personal allowances are to be increased\nby £200 in excess of statutory indexation as well. The married couple's allowance, and those\nallowances linked to it, are all to be increased by £40 in line with inflation.\n1. Personal Allowance\nEvery taxpayer resident in the United Kingdom is entitled to a personal allowance to be set\nagainst any type of income including investment income. There are three different levels for\n1997-98:\nUnder 65 £4,045\n65 - 74 £5,220\n75 and over £5,400\nAll three allowances are to be increased by an additional £200 on top of the increase under\nstatutory indexation. The basic personal allowance rises by £280; both age related personal\nallowances rise by £310. The entitlement to age allowance is determined separately for each\nspouse based on their own age. The extra age allowance is reduced above a certain income\nlimit by £1 for every £2 by which income exceeds the limit (see section B3). However no\naged taxpayer receives less than the basic personal allowance available to those under 65.\nThe personal allowance is not transferable between spouses.\n2. Married Couple's Allowance\nA married couple's allowance (MCA) is given to all married couples. It can be claimed by\neither spouse, or divided between them. If no preference is expressed, the allowance is given\nto the husband. The wife has the right to claim half the MCA; couples must make a joint\nelection if she is to claim the entire allowance. A higher allowance is given to couples in\nwhich at least one partner is over 65 years old. A second higher rate is given if one partner\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nis over 75. Only the basic MCA is transferable between husband and wife; not the higher\nrates.\nThe ordinary MCA and the age-related allowances for 1997-98 are set out below:\nBoth aged\nunder 65\n£1,830\nOne or both\naged 65 - 74\n£3,185\nOne or both\naged 75+\n£3,225\nThe MCA is reduced by one twelfth for each complete tax month pre-marriage. The higher\nallowances for those over 65 are reduced above a certain income limit by £1 for every £2 of\nexcess income (see section B3).\nIn the March 1993 Budget the then Chancellor (Norman Lamont) announced that the MCA\nwould be restricted to 20 per cent from 6 April 1994, so that its money value would be the\nsame for all taxpayers whatever their marginal rate of tax. Personal allowances are worth\nmore to higher rate taxpayers, since they represent a fixed sum which is exempted from tax\nat an individual's highest marginal tax rate. At that time the basic MCA was set at £1,720,\nand was worth £688 for those whose marginal rate was 40 per cent; whereas it was worth\nonly £344 for 20 per cent taxpayers. Restricting the allowance to 20 per cent meant that all\ntaxpayers received £344 as a deduction from their final tax bill. In effect the allowance has\nbecome more like a tax credit. In the November 1993 Budget the current Chancellor,\nKenneth Clarke, announced that all three MCAs were to be further restricted to 15 per cent\nwith effect from 1995-96. The 15 per cent restriction will continue to apply to these\nallowances for 1997-98. As a result, the ordinary MCA will be worth £274.50 to all\ntaxpayers. The same restriction applies to the additional personal allowance, and to the\nwidow's bereavement allowance (these allowances are discussed below).\nAs a result of the introduction of independent taxation in April 1990, transitional allowances\nwere introduced to minimise the loss faced by those couples where the wife was the\nbreadwinner, and those couples where the wife was in a higher age allowance band than her\nhusband. These arrangements will affect fewer people as the years go by. Details are given\nin Independent Taxation, Library Research Note 90/9, 5 February 1990.\n3. Income Limit for Age Allowance\nTaxpayers claiming an age-related allowance whose income exceeds £15,600 for 1997-98 will\nhave their allowance reduced by £1 for every £2 that their income exceeds this limit. This\nprogressive reduction continues until the allowance is equal in value to that of the ordinary\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\npersonal allowance or the basic MCA. The income limit has been increased in line with\ninflation, from the limit of £15,200 for 1996-97. For individual taxpayers qualifying for an\nage-related personal allowance the benefit of the allowance will not fall out until the\nfollowing levels:\n65 - 74 £17,950\n75 and over £18,310\nFor the MCA, the figures will depend on the age of the husband and of the older spouse. The\nage-related personal allowance is reduced before the age-related MCA, when any individual's\ntax bill is calculated.2\n4. Additional Personal Allowance\nAn additional personal allowance (APA) is available in respect of individuals caring for\nchildren, and for husbands caring for an incapacitated wife. The allowance is equal in value\nto the ordinary married couple's allowance: £1,830 for 1997-98, restricted to 15 per cent. The\nchild may be the claimant's natural or adopted child, or simply a child maintained at the\nclaimant's expense (eg, fostered). The child has to be under 18, unless he or she is in full-\ntime education or in an apprenticeship of at least two years' duration. Those eligible for the\nAPA are:\n• a woman who is not, throughout the tax year in question, married and living with\nher husband.\n• a man who is not, for all or part of the tax year in question, married and living with\nhis wife.3\n• a man who is, for all or part of the tax year in question, living with his wife, if she\nis totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity throughout the tax year (of\ncourse, in this case, the allowance would be given in addition to the MCA). Married\nwomen caring for their incapacitated spouse are not eligible for the allowance.\nSingle or divorced women, as well as widows, widowers, and single men, may claim the\nAPA, provided they are taking care of at least one child (only one allowance is paid,\nirrespective of the number of children cared for by the claimant). If both parents, living apart,\nclaim the allowance in respect of the same child, then they may elect to have it split between\nthem. If they cannot agree, the allowance is split in proportion to the amount of time each\nparent spends with the child.4\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n     \n2 Under section 257A(5)(b) of ICTA 1988\n     \n3 Provided he is not entitled to the transitional tax relief given to couples who separated before 6 April 1990.\n     \n4 Under section 260 of ICTA 1988\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\n5. Spouse's Transitional Exemption\nThe tax treatment of maintenance was changed substantially by provisions in the Finance Act\n1988. Previously, those providing maintenance could apply for tax relief at their marginal\nrate of tax on their payments. The person receiving maintenance - ex-spouse or child - would\nbe taxed on this income. The 1988 reform removed these transactions from the tax system.\nThose who make payments cannot claim them against tax, and those who receive them are\nnot taxed on them. This applies to all maintenance payments made under a court order, a\nChild Support Agency assessment, or other type of legally binding agreement, made after 15\nMarch 1988.\nSeparated or divorced individuals who pay maintenance direct to their ex-spouse qualify for\na limited form of tax relief, sometimes called a 'maintenance allowance', equivalent to the\nMCA (ie, an allowance of no more than £1,830). This relief is not extended to those making\nmaintenance payments to an ex-partner, rather than to an ex-spouse, and it does not cover\nmaintenance paid to children. Individuals may claim relief for payments made to more than\none ex-spouse, but however many people they make payments to, the total amount of relief\ngiven in any one tax year is the same. Tax relief is withdrawn if the ex-spouse who receives\nmaintenance remarries. Relief has been restricted in the same way as the MCA: to 20 per\ncent for 1994-95, and to 15 per cent for 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98.\nUnder agreements made before 15 March 1988, the taxpayer will continue to receive tax relief\nat the level he or she was allowed in 1988-89, through the PAYE system. Tax relief on the\nfirst £1,830 of maintenance paid is restricted to 15 per cent for 1997-98. Those who receive\nmaintenance under the old system receive it gross. Where payments are made direct to an\nex-spouse, the first £1,830 may be received tax free (this relief has not been restricted).\n6. Widows Bereavement Allowance\nThe widows bereavement allowance (WBA) is intended to relieve some of the financial\ndistress of bereavement. It is set equal to the basic MCA (ie, £1,830 restricted to 15 per cent\nfor 1997-98). The allowance may be claimed as well as the additional personal allowance,\nand, of course, the personal allowance. It is available from the date of the death to the end\nof the following tax year, and applies against the widow's own income in this period. There\nis no corresponding allowance for widowers.\n7. Blind Person's Allowance\nAny person registered as blind is entitled to the blind person's allowance (BPA). The\nallowance is worth £1,280 for 1997-98, having been increased in line with inflation on the\nprevious year. Unlike the married couple's allowance, and those allowances linked to it, the\nBPA is not restricted in value. If someone has insufficient income to make use of the\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nallowance, it can be transferred to a spouse. In his 1996 Budget, the Chancellor proposed that\nthe WBA would become subject to the same statutory requirement for indexation as the other\nincome tax allowances.\nSummary Table of the Allowances\n£ 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95 1995-96 1996-97 1997-98\nPersonal \nAllowance\n 3,445  3,445  3,445  3,525  3,765  4,045\n    \" (65 - 74)  4,200  4,200  4,200  4,630  4,910  5,220\n    \" (75 & +)  4,370  4,370  4,370  4,800  5,090  5,400\nMCA (basic)  1,720  1,720  1,720*  1,720*  1,790*  1,830*\nMCA (65 - 74)  2,465  2,465  2,465*  2,995*  3,115*  3,185*\nMCA (75 & +)  2,505  2,505  2,505*  3,035*  3,155*  3,225*\nAPA  1,720  1,720  1,720*  1,720*  1,790*  1,830*\nWBA  1,720  1,720  1,720*  1,720*  1,790*  1,830*\nIncome Limit 14,200 14,200 14,200 14,600 15,200 15,600\nBPA  1,080  1,080  1,080  1,200  1,250  1,280\n* Relief restricted to 20 per cent in 1994-95 and 15 per cent in the three tax years: 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98.\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nC. Benefits - Company Cars & Free Fuel\nIn April 1994 the system of car benefit charges - based on the size of a car's engine - was\nreplaced by a new system, based on the car's list price. A charge of 35 per cent of the price\nof a car is made, with discounts for business mileage and older cars.\nThe tax charge on the benefit of free fuel used in company cars for 1997-98 will increase by\n13 per cent for petrol cars, and 15 per cent for diesel cars. The intention is to increase the\ntax charge on the benefit of free fuel in line with the prices other drivers pay for their fuel.\nThe scale charges for 1997-98 are:\nPETROL CARS DIESEL CARS\nEngine size cc Scale charge £ Engine size cc Scale charge £\n0 - 1,400 800 0 - 2,000 740\n1,400 - 2,000 1,010 2,001 + 940\n2,001 + 1,490\nD. Pensions\nThe pension scheme earnings cap will be increased in line with inflation, from £82,200 to\n£84,000 for 1997-98. This is the maximum earnings from which contributions to a personal\nor occupational pension scheme can attract tax relief.\nE. Charities\nThere is no general tax exemption or relief granted to taxpayers who make gifts to charities,\nthough there are specific reliefs covering regular donations made out of one's salary (payroll\ngiving), and one-off cash gifts of a minimum size (Gift Aid), as well as to covenanted\ndonations.\nThe payroll giving scheme is designed to encourage employees to make contributions to\ncharity. The maximum amount which an employee can give remains £1,200 per year, set by\nthe Finance Act 1996. The annual amount paid in this way is wholly deductible for income\ntax purposes, the relief being given through the PAYE system. The employer deducts the\nappropriate sum from a participating employee's pay, and passes it to an agency who\ndistributes it to the charity or charities of the employee's choice. Gift Aid allows income tax\nrelief for single donations by individuals. When this relief was introduced, the minimum limit\nwas £600; the current minimum is £250, set by the Finance Act 1993.\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nF. Mortgages\nThere is no change to the £30,000 limit on loans qualifying for interest relief for the purchase\nof a main residence. Tax relief on mortgage interest (MIRAS) was limited to the basic rate\nof income tax from 6 April 1991. Relief was restricted to 20 per cent from 6 April 1994, and\nto 15 per cent from 6 April 1995. MIRAS remains restricted to 15 per cent for 1997-98.\nG. Capital Gains Tax\nThe annual exempt amount has been increased in line with statutory indexation, to £6,500 for\nindividuals, in accordance with the indexation of thresholds for capital taxes incorporated in\nsections 80 and 91 of the Finance Act 1982. Gains are then taxed at one's marginal rate of\nincome.\nH. Inheritance Tax\nInheritance tax is levied on the value of a person's estate at the time of their death. Generally,\npersonal gift giving is free from tax. However most gifts made out of someone's estate within\nseven years of their death are assessed as part of that person's estate, and are liable to tax as\nwell. The tax is charged at 40 per cent above the tax-free threshold. This is increased from\n£200,000 to £215,000 for 1997-98, £10,000 in excess of indexation. This follows a\nsubstantial increase of £46,000 last year. Taken together, the threshold has increased by\nnearly 40 per cent in two years (ie, from £154,000 to £215,000).\nI. Profit Related Pay\nProfit Related Pay (PRP) is that part of an employee's pay which rises, and falls, in line with\nthe profits of the business in which they work. Provided PRP is paid under a scheme\nregistered with the Inland Revenue, the employee may receive it free of income tax, up to a\ngiven limit: either 20% of their salary, or £4,000, whichever is the lower, in the profit period\nto which the PRP relates. A 'profit period' is the employer's accounting period, normally 12\nmonths. Currently, basic-rate taxpayers receiving PRP will pay up to £960 less income tax\n(24 per cent of £4,000) than an equivalent employee not receiving PRP. Higher-rate\ntaxpayers pay up to £1,600 per year less income tax.\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nThe Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, has proposed in his November 1996 Budget that tax relief\nfor PRP be phased out over a three to four year period; so that for profit periods beginning\n • before 1 January 1998, there will be no change in the £4,000 ceiling on relief;\n • between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1998, the ceiling will be reduced to £2,000;\n • between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 1999, the ceiling will be reduced to £1,000;\n • on or after 1 January 2000, no relief will be available.\n13\n\n\nEconomic Policy & Taxation\nRecent research papers on related subjects have been:\n96/108 Economic indicators 25.11.96\n96/105 Unemployment by constituency 13.11.96\n96/103 Landfill 8.11.96\n96/33 Economic and monetary union 1.3.96\n96/18 The value of the £ since 1750 1.2.96\n95/129 Financial services : regulators and ombudsmen 13.12.95\n95/122 Overseas aid and the 1995 Budget 4.12.95\n\n\n\n"

Introduction\nUnder the former rules this benefit was generally not affected by a hospital stay. Regulations\ncame into force on 31 July 1996 so that the allowance generally ceases after 4 weeks as an\nin-patient (12 weeks in the case of a child). They are due for debate on 5 December 1996.\nSome transitional protection for existing recipients is provided as described in the note.\nFurther discussion of the regulations and more detailed summary of responses to the\nconsultation exercise can be found in the Report by the Social Security Advisory Committee\non SI 1996/14361. This includes the regulations, an explanatory memorandum from the DSS\non the original regulations, a summary of the representations made to the SSAC, the SSAC\nreport on the regulations and the Secretary of State's statement on the report.\nB. Disability living allowance - the former rules\nDisability living allowance (DLA) is a benefit for disabled people. Its main features are:\n• Available to both children and adults;\n• Introduced in April 1992, replacing the old mobility allowance and attendance\nallowance for people under 65 with a single benefit;\n• Aimed at people who need help looking after themselves and who have difficulty\nwalking;\n• Tax-free, not means-tested or related to national insurance contributions;\n• Provided a person continued to satisfy the conditions of entitlement, the mobility\ncomponent of DLA was unaffected by a hospital stay. The care component is not paid\nafter 4 weeks for adults or 12 weeks for children.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 Cm 3233, June 1996\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nThere are two elements to DLA:\n• a care component for help with personal care needs, paid at three different levels;\n• a mobility component for help with walking difficulties, paid at two levels. The\nhigher rate is currently £33.90 pw and the lower £12.90 pw.\nIt is paid in addition to earnings or other income and generally the whole allowance is paid\non top of any other social security benefits.\nThe regulations affect the mobility component. To qualify for this, a person must be over 5\nand under 66 when they first claim. The must also be able, from time to time, to benefit from\n\"facilities for enhanced locomotion\"2. Thus a person who cannot be moved for medical\nreasons would not be eligible. They must also satisfy the disability conditions, detailed\nbelow:\nDLA mobility component conditions of entitlement\nFor the higher rate a person must be:\neither suffering from a physical disability such that they are\nunable to walk;\nor suffering from a physical disability such that they are\nvirtually unable to walk;\nor both deaf and blind;\nor a double amputee or have been born without feet;\nor severely mentally impaired and have severe\nbehavioural problems and qualify for the highest rate\nof disability living allowance care component.\nFor the lower rate a person needs to show that although they\nare able to walk they are so severely disabled, physically or\nmentally, that, ignoring familiar routes, they are unable to\ntake advantage of their walking abilities outdoors without\nguidance or supervision from another person most of the time.\nFor both rates a person must have satisfied one of these\nconditions for at least the past 3 months and be likely to\nsatisfy it for the next 6 months (unless they are terminally ill)\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n2 Section 73 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nC. Disability living allowance - the new rules\nFrom 31 July 1996, the mobility component of DLA is no longer paid after 4 weeks of an in-\npatient stay (12 weeks for children). \nThe change was first announced briefly by Peter Lilley, Secretary of State for Social Security,\nin his 1995 statement on the uprating of benefits. Among a number of measures to remove\nanomalies, he proposed to \"align the mobility component of disability living allowance more\nclosely with similar benefits that are withdrawn during hospital stays.\"3 The reasons for the\nchange were explained in an accompanying press notice:4\n\"DLA is intended to help with the extra costs arising out of a disability and the\nmobility component is primarily intended to help disabled people be\nindependently mobile.\nHospital patients, especially acute patients, have little scope to be\nindependently mobile whilst in hospital and most of their needs are met by the\nNHS. Most other Social Security benefits are either withdrawn or reduced\nwhen a person goes into hospital to prevent duplicate provision from public\nfunds. It cannot be right to pay people who are unable to use the benefit for\nthe purpose intended and who are already having most of their needs met by\nthe taxpayer.\nWe believe the move is justified in ensuring that taxpayers' money goes to\nthose best placed to benefit from it.\"\nIn the DSS' Explanatory Memorandum to the SSAC it was suggested that hospitals are\naccumulating large sums of money from unspent benefits paid to in-patients. Also, in some\ncases where the NHS was already meeting all a patient's needs, the allowance was being used\nto buy tobacco, cigarettes, sweets etc, rather than for mobility purposes. The DSS maintains\nthis is evidence of the healthcare and social security systems overlapping, both providing for\nthe same contingencies, and DLA as a result is either unspent or inappropriately spent.\n1. Transitional protection\nPartial protection was provided for some existing recipients of mobility component of DLA.\nThe regulations include provision to continue to pay the mobility component at the lower\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 HC Deb 29 Nov 95 c.1214\n4 DSS Press Notice 95/160, Peter Lilley Brings Disability Living Allowance in line with other benefits 29 Nov 1996 \n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nrate only to some patients who when the regulations come into force have been in hospital\nfor more than 12 months.\nExcluded, or partially excluded, from this protection are those who:\n• are committed to a hospital following involvement in criminal proceedings or under\nsentence5 and those who have been compulsorily admitted to hospital because of their\nneed for care and treatment as a result of their mental disorder6. They will be\nexcluded from the protection given to other long stay patients;\n• use their mobility component to pay for a car under the Motability scheme. They will\nhave their benefit paid at the higher of the lower rate or the level required to meet\npayments under the agreement for the hire or hire-purchase of the vehicle;\n• have been a NHS in-patient for less than 12 months at the time of the change.\nIn his statement on the regulations, Peter Lilley argues \"that it has long been accepted that\na person's needs are fully met during a period of hospital treatment. Where no charge is made\nfor that treatment, any payment of benefit intended to meet the same needs would amount to\ndouble provision from public funds. For this reason, most Social Security benefits are\nwithdrawn or reduced after a period, commonly 6 weeks, of free in-patient treatment in a\nhospital or similar institution.\"7 \nDLA mobility component is unusual in being largely unaffected by a spell as a hospital in-\npatient. It is common for benefits to be reduced during hospital stays. Often this first takes\nplace at six weeks or later. The proposals for DLA mobility component for those in hospital\nwould align it with the care component and Attendance Allowance which are withdrawn after\nfour weeks in the case of an adult. The payment of benefits for a short spell as an in-patient\nrecognises that financial commitments do not necessarily stop when someone goes into\nhospital; also they avoid the administrative costs of making adjustments of benefits for short\nhospital stays. Appendix 1 shows how a spell as a hospital in-patient affects various non-\nmeans-tested benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 Sentenced prisoners are already excluded from benefit\n6 Including those detained under Parts II and III of the Mental Health Act 1983 or Parts V and VI of the Mental\n(Scotland) Act 1984.\n7 Cm 3233 para 4\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nD. SSAC consultation and response\nThe proposed regulations were referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC).\nThe SSAC requested representations to be made in a consultation exercise ending on\n12 February 1996. There were 189 responses and the overwhelming view of these was that\nthe proposals were based on false information and should not be implemented. The SSAC\nconcurred with this view and also thought the proposals would introduce many anomalies.\nIts main conclusion was that the proposals should not be proceeded with in their present form.\nThe SSAC also made a number of secondary recommendations, including:\n• A more rigorous analysis of the appropriateness and availability of NHS funding for\nthe mobility needs of patients should be carried out;\n• Persons detained under Part II or III of the Mental Health Act 1983 should have the\nsame entitlement as other patients;\n• Consideration should be given to patients who need to initiate or renew a Motability\nagreement before they are able to leave hospital;\n• A more gradual downrating of the mobility component for long-stay patients should\nbe examined.\n• A linking rule should be introduced in determining the 12 month period for\ntransitional protection;\nThe Government agreed with the last of these, and the regulations now allow people who are\nout of hospital for 28 days or less between in-patient stays to be treated if they had been\ncontinuously in hospital, and provision for this is now contained in the regulations8. However\nthey were unable to accept the other recommendations and considered the overall case for\nchange to be \"compelling\".9\nThe final regulations were laid before Parliament on 7 June 1996 and came into force on 31\nJuly 1996.10\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 Regulation 2(2)\n9 Cm 3233, Statement by the Secretary of State para 41\n10 SI 1996 1436\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nE. Reactions to the regulations\nThe overwhelming view of respondents to the SSAC consultation exercise was that the\nproposals were based on false information and should not be implemented, also that\nimplementation of the proposals would cause individual patients financial hardship and could\nlengthen their stay and thus increase other areas of public expenditure.11\nThe main concerns of respondents underlying their views were:\n• False assumptions made about the lack of mobility needs of long-stay patients and the\nmeeting of them by the NHS. The fact finding exercise carried out by the DSS was\nfundamentally flawed in not talking to patients or those directly responsible for their\nday-to-day care;\n• Alignment with DLA care component ignores separate benefit history and objectives.\nWhile it is easy to argue the NHS provides for the care needs of a patient and to give\nbenefit for these would be 'double provision', it is less clear that the NHS provides for\nall mobility needs in the same way.\n                                          \n• Long-stay patients, particularly, are often in hospitals in isolated areas and mobility\ncomponent can be used to enable them to make and receive visits. This is even more\nimportant where children are involved;\n• There is evidence that in many cases the mobility component is used imaginatively\nand constructively to enhance the quality of life of long-stay patients. Unspent\nbalances are evidence of poor organisation and provision rather than lack of mobility\nneed;\n• Patients in NHS-provided homes and hospitals will be worse-off than those in homes\nprovided by other bodies even though care provided and needs may be similar. The\nproposals run counter to the efforts to transfer care from hospital to community-based;\n• Transitional protection does not include people who have been in hospital for less than\na year who will lose benefit at 4 weeks. Also the exclusion of those in special\nhospitals, secure units and those detained in low/no security hospitals effectively puts\nthem in the same position as convicted prisoners (who are already barred from benefit)\nrather than patients;\n• Restriction of protection to those who have a vehicle via Motability excludes anyone\nwho has similar private arrangements. Also that it will not be possible to renew a\nMotability agreement while in hospital;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n11 Cm 3233 Appendix 2\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\n• It is already possible under existing legislation12 to deny benefit to claimants who are\nunable to benefit from enhanced mobility. The reasons given by the DSS are not\nsufficient to justify the regulations.\nA fuller summary of representations made to the SSAC appears in its report.13\nF. Numbers affected and savings\nThe DSS estimates some 40,000 people would have their benefit payments of mobility\ncomponent reduced or withdrawn: 25,000 people on the higher rate who would have been in\nhospital for 12 months or more at the time of the change would have their payments reduced;\n15,000 who are either in-patients of less than 12 months or new cases would have benefit\nwithdrawn.14\nWithin the group of patients who have been in hospital for more than 12 months are around\n3,000 patients in special hospitals or secure units whose payments would cease.\nAround 35,000 patients receiving the lower rate who would have been in hospital for\n12 months or more at the change will see no variation in their benefit.\nThe savings from the change are put at £25 million in 1996/7 and £40 million in 1997/8.\nAround three-quarters of the savings are due to the change in the rules for adults and a\nquarter from the change as it affects children.15\nA number of respondents to the consultation exercise questioned whether the cost of the\nchange can be measured entirely in terms of benefits no longer paid. They pointed out that\nsome of the savings could be offset by additional costs faced by the NHS if the change results\nin prolonging the length of stay of patients or hindering efforts to provide rehabilitation.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12 Section 73 Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992\n13 Cm 3233 Appendix 2\n14 DSS Explanatory Memorandum to the SSAC\n15 HC Deb 23 April 1996 c135W\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nAppendix 1\nEffect of hospital stays on non-means-tested benefits\nTime in hospital\nBenefit At least 1 day 4 weeks 6 weeks 12 weeks 1 year\nStatutory sick pay\nStatutory maternity pay\nMaternity allowance\nPaid for only a limited period only, otherwise unaffected by a stay in hospital\nIncapacity benefit\nSevere disablement allowance\nRetirement pension\nWidowed mother's allowance\nWidow's pension\nIf (non-spouse)\nadult dependent is\nin hospital,\ndependent's\nincrease generally\nstops\nBenefit for people\nadmitted from local\nauthority homes\nreduced to\n£12.25pw\nNo further\nchange\nBenefit reduced to\n£24.50pw (unless\npatient has\ndependents - when\nreduced by\n£12.25pw)\nIf dependent\nspouse is in\nhospital,\ndependent's\naddition where\npaid is reduced by\n£12.25pw or to\n£12.25 whichever\nis most beneficial\nIf dependent\nchild is in\nhospital,\ndependent's\nincrease only\ncontinues only if\nthe claimant is\nstill contributing\nto his/her\nmaintenance\nBenefit reduced to\n£12.25pw\n12\n\n\nTime in hospital\nBenefit At least 1 day 4 weeks 6 weeks 12 weeks 1 year\nDisablement benefit No change Constant\nattendance\nallowance\nstops\nUnemployability\nsupplement is\nreduced in the\nsame way as\nincapacity benefit \nNo further\nchange\nUnemployability\nsupplement is\nreduced in the\nsame way as\nincapacity benefit\nInvalid care allowance (where carer\nhospitalised)\nNo change Benefit stops\nChild benefit and one parent benefit No change Benefit continues as long as the patient\nis still contributing to the maintenance\nof the child\nDLA (mobility component) No change Benefit stops if\nclaimant 16 or\nover\nIf claimant under\n16 benefit stops\nDLA (care component)\nAttendance allowance\nNo change Benefit stops if\nclaimant 16 or\nover\nIf claimant under\n16 benefit stops\n \n13\n\n\nRecent Research Papers\n96/101 The Education Bill [Bill 8 of Session 1996/97] 06.11.96\n96/102 Controls on Firearms: The Firearms (Amendment) Bill 08.11.96\n96/103 Landfill 08.11.96\n96/104 Hong Kong: The Final Stages 13.11.96\n96/105 Unemployment by Constituency - October 1996 13.11.96\n96/106 The Working Time Directive 19.11.96\n96/107 The Social Security Administration (Fraud) Bill \n[Bill 15 of 1996/97] 20.11.96\n96/108 Economic Indicators 25.11.96\n96/109 Personal Tax Allowances & Reliefs 1997-98 27.11.96\n96/110 Economic & Monetary Union [not yet printed]\n\n\n\n"

Nirex's remit is to develop disposal routes for\nintermediate-level waste (ILW) and certain types of relatively hazardous low-level waste\n(LLW) (see later). It is important to differentiate between disposal, which implies\npermanency, and storage, which is designed as a temporary measure.\nAfter numerous deliberations Nirex is currently working to provide and manage a deep\nunderground repository for the wastes within its remit at Longlands Farm, near Sellafield in\nCumbria. In addition to a test drilling programme involving a series of boreholes, Nirex\nproposes to excavate a Rock Characterisation Facility (RCF) or \"rock laboratory\" at the site\nto develop its safety case prior to excavating the repository itself. It is the RCF, at present\nat the centre of a contentious planning appeal, which is the subject of this paper.\nMajor features of the Government's radioactive waste management policy are described in\nLibrary Research Paper 96/30 - Radioactive Waste: Some Topical Issues. This sets Nirex's\nposition within the UK's policy for radioactivity waste management in context.\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nII. History\nNirex has arrived at its present position by a long and tortuous route. Several other policies\nand sites have been considered and rejected along the way, not least because of public dissent\ncharacterised by the Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY) syndrome1:\n37. When Nirex was established by the nuclear industry in 1982, its task, in line with the\nGovernment's policy at that time, was to develop two disposal routes for ILW and LLW:\n(a) deep disposal of long-lived ILW in an underground repository; and\n(b) shallow burial of LLW and short-lived ILW in engineered trenches 20 to 30\nmetres below the surface.\nInitially, Nirex explored the possibility of developing a disused ICI anhydrite mine at\nBillingham in Cleveland as a deep repository, but in 1985, following local and national\ncontroversy, ICI decided not to make the mine available to Nirex. At the Government's\nrequest, Nirex than concentrated on finding a site for a shallow repository for LLW and short-\nlived ILW.\n38. Elstow in Bedfordshire had originally been identified in 1983 as the potential site for a\nshallow repository, but in 1986 Nirex's investigations were widen to include three other\nlocations in the clay geology of Eastern England. The same year, the Government accepted\nthe recommendations of the Environment Select Committee that no ILW should be disposed\nof in near-surface facilities. In 1987, the proposals were dropped and Nirex concentrated\ninstead on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose facility for both ILW and\nLLW. This, it argued, would be the most cost-effective solution.\n39. In 1989, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced Nirex's recommendation\nthat a deep repository should be developed on land rather than under the sea and that the next\nstep should be to carry out detailed geological studies in the vicinity of Sellafield and\nDounreay. The Government agreed that further exploratory work was necessary before any\nparticular site could be decided on. In July 1991, Nirex announced that it would concentrate\nits investigations on Sellafield. In addition to its test-drilling programme there, Nirex\nproposes to excavate a Rock Characterisation Facility (RCF), or \"rock laboratory\", more than\n650 m deep in order to help develop the safety case for the repository.\n                                                                                                                      \n                                                     \n1\n Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy: Preliminary Conclusions, Department of the Environment,\nAugust 1994\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nA planning application for the RCF was submitted to Cumbria County Council on 1 February\n1994 and refused on 20 December. This is separate from the planning application for the\nrepository itself, for which the Government has promised2 its own full public inquiry.\nOn 27 February 1995 the Environment Secretary, John Gummer, announced3 that a planning\nappeal by Nirex for the RCF would be considered in September 1995. This took place and\nclosed on 1 February 1996. The report of the appeal was originally expected to be delivered\nto the Secretary of State for the Environment by the end of October. In the answer to a\nrecent parliamentary question this date was postponed4:\nDr John Cunningham : To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment (1) when he\nexpects to make a decision on the planning appeal for the construction of a rock\ncharacterisation facility at Longlands farm, Gosforth, Cumbria;\n(2) when he expects to receive the planning inspector's report relating to the inquiry into the\nconstruction of a rock characterisation facility at Longlands farm, Gosforth, Cumbria.\nMr Jones: The Planning Inspectorate has advised that it expects to send the report to my\nright Hon. Friend the Secretary of State in mid-December. Until we have received and\nconsidered the report, I cannot say when the decision on the appeal might be made.\nThe announcement that it is uncertain when a decision on the appeal might be made is\ninteresting. Similar uncertainties have surrounded previous cases. Most notably the decision\nabout a shallow repository. In that instance the decision to drop plans was announced just\nbefore parliament was dissolved for the 1987 election5. Dr David Clark for the Labour Party\nwelcomed the decision and said:\nHowever, we recognise, as does the rest of the country, that the Government have acted only\nin a squalid attempt to save themselves from electoral embarrassment. There can be no other\nexplanation for this announcement being made today. If I lived in one of the four\nconstituencies affected, I would need more reassurance than that given by the Government\nthat they will not reverse the policy if by an accident they happen to win the next election.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n2\n Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy: Final Conclusions, Cm 2919 July 1995\n3\n Department of Environment, News Release No93, 1995\n4\n HC Deb 5 November 1996 c464w\n5\n HC Deb 1 May 1987 c504-12\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nIII. Classes of Radioactive Waste\nRadioactive waste in the UK is divided into four broad categories depending upon its\nradioactivity and associated heat generating capacity:\n• High-Level Waste (HLW) is waste in which sufficient heat is generated for\nthis to be a significant consideration in the design of storage and disposal\nfacilities. Essentially HLW consists of fission products (ie the radioactive\nremains) of uranium and plutonium from spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors;\n• Intermediate-Level Waste (ILW)  is waste in which the radioactive decay\nprocess generates insufficient heat for this to be a design requirement in\nstorage or disposal facilities, but with activity levels above that defined as the\nupper limit for low-level waste (see below). It comprises cladding from spent\nnuclear fuel, filters and wastes from effluent treatment, worn-out plant and\nequipment, and radioactive materials used in medical treatments, industry and\ndefence;\n• Low-Level Waste (LLW) is waste which contains radioactive materials above\nthe very low-level waste acceptable for disposal with ordinary refuse, but\nbelow 4 GBq6 per tonne of alpha (α)7 or 12 GBq per tonne of β8/γ9 activity.\nIt includes rubble and steelwork from decommissioning of nuclear reactors and\nitems such as rubber glovers and protective clothing;\n• Very Low-Level Waste (VLLW) is waste which can safely be disposed of\nwith ordinary refuse.\nNirex's remit is to develop disposal routes only for ILW and a small quantity of relatively\nhazardous LLW which are α-emitters of long half-life10.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n6\n 1 GBq (gigabequerel) is 1,000,000,000 radioactive emissions per second.\n7\n alpha or α-particles consist of two protons and two neutrons which form the nucleus, or central heavy part\nof the helium atom.\n8\n beta or β-particles are electrons which are constituents of atoms.\n9\n gamma or γ-rays are electromagnetic rays, like light.\n10\n the half-life is the time taken for half of any given amount of a radioactive element to decay.\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nCurrently ILW is stored on the surface at nuclear power stations and other facilities. At\npresent there is a volume that would cover a football pitch to a depth of 40 feet (90,000 cu\nmetres). This is expected to double early on next century11. \nMost LLW is currently disposed off by shallow burial at British Nuclear Fuels' Drigg site in\nCumbria. This is not expected to be full until well into next century. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n11\n Nirex - the facts, Nirex, September 1994\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nIV. Containment of Radioactivity in the Repository\nRadioactivity decays with time. In many cases this occurs relatively quickly, but certain\nelements have such a long half-life that significant radioactivity remains for many thousands\nof years. Because the hazard associated with radioactive waste, although constantly\ndecreasing, remains for such a long time in some cases, it is necessary to ensure its prolonged\ncontainment in the proposed repository. To this end a set of man-made and natural barriers\nare planned to isolate the waste from man's environment12:\n• the waste would be packed in steel drums or boxes with a cement mixture\npoured to the brim. This in itself is expected to provide a high degree of\nphysical containment for at least 1,000 years during which time about 99% of\nthe radioactivity will have decayed;\n• a special cement grout has been developed which would be used to back-fill\nthe space between the drums after they have been placed underground. The\nchemical nature of this grout will ensure that alkaline13 conditions are\nmaintained for upwards of 1,000,000 years. By this time more than 99.99% of\nthe original radioactivity will have decayed. In addition the grout is porous\nenough to allow \"sorption\" ie the attachment of materials to its surface. Such\nconditions help to chemically and physically immobilise the radioactive\nmaterials within the repository;\n• the repository, which would be sealed upon-closure, is planned about half-a-\nmile underground. The overlying rocks provide the final barrier to prevent\nradioactive material reaching the human environment.\nThe aim is to prevent radioactive material from coming into contact with groundwater in\nwhich it could dissolve, because this is the principal route by which radioactive material could\nbe transported from a repository through the overlying rock to the surface where it could\naffect humans.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n12\n A world of science, Nirex, 1996\n13\n Alkaline describes a solution that has an excess of hydroxide ions. This condition slows the rate that\nradioactive material will dissolve in groundwater.\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nV. The Rock Characterisation Facility\nDespite the integrity of the containment designed for the radioactive material planned for the\nrepository, it is essential for Nirex to prove that the proposed repository will be safe. To\nachieve this Nirex formulated a scientific programme to carry out a post-closure performance\nassessment (PCSA) for a repository at Longlands Farm near Sellafield. It comprised\nactivities to14:\n- characterise the geological and hydrogeological conditions at the site which will\ninfluence the post-closure safety performance of a repository.\n- develop the data and models to describe the processes influencing radionuclide return\nto the human environment.\nResults from these activities feed into the development of the methodology and models which\nwill be used to evaluate post-closure safety performance.\n \nTo this end numerous boreholes have been drilled in the area. These provide rock cores\nwhich can be examined mineralogically. In addition equipment which emits and detects\nsound waves can be lowered into the boreholes. This is employed in a technique known as\nseismic tomography (similar to the technique used in whole body scanners in hospitals) to\nbuild up a picture of the rock structure. Groundwater flow properties have also been\nmeasured, and samples of groundwater and dissolved gases at depth have been taken to\ninvestigate groundwater age and evolution. Boreholes, however, are only able to yield some\nof the information required. To determine detail an underground laboratory known as the\nRock Characterisation Facility (RCF) is necessary. \nThe main objectives of the RCF programme were stated in Nirex Report 32715as follows:\n- to provide geological and hydrogeological characterisation data and scope for a model\nvalidation programme which will permit a firmer assessment of long-term safety:\n- to provide data needed to decide on a footprint, design and orientation for a\nrepository within the geologically suitable zone; and\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n14\n Review of aspects of the scientific mission and role of the Nirex RCF at Sellafield, RWMAC, September 1995\n15\n A Rock Characterisation Facility Consultative Document, Nirex, October 1992\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\n- to provide geotechnical data on rock competence and fracture characteristics to\ninform decisions on repository construction methods and to enable cost estimates to\nbe refined.\nThe same Nirex Report also explained the testing capabilities that the RCF would offer in\naddition to surface-based investigations already carried out:\n- bulk data can be obtained in three dimensions from a large volume of rock, rather\nthan from isolated lengths of rock core drilled from the surface;\n- specialised tests can be performed directly on specific features; and\n- tests are less constrained by the limitation of design or location of surface\ninvestigations.\nIt is planned that the RCF will develop in phases16. Two deep vertical shafts will be sunk to\nabout 920m and 790m from the surface. These will each be 5m in diameter and 50m apart.\nFrom these, three main horizontal galleries will be constructed each about 150m long at a\ndepth currently planned to be 735m below the surface. Two of these galleries will be\nextended to 375m and 600m, and three further galleries up to 200m will be constructed. The\nfollowing diagram is a representation of the RCF at completion17.\n  \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n16\n Rock Characterisation Facility, Nirex, July 1994\n17\n Nirex-the facts, Nirex, September 1994\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nFigure 1 An artist's view of the Rock Characterisation Facility\nAt each phase various aspects of the scientific programme will be carried out.

Views of Independent Bodies\nThree major independent bodies have carried out evaluations of the scientific issues associated\nwith deep disposal of radioactive waste in the UK. These are the Royal Society, the\nRadioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC), and Her Majesty's\nInspectorate of Pollution. These evaluations were quoted by those giving evidence to the\nRCF Inquiry.\nA. The Royal Society Report\nThe Royal Society Report20 was concerned with the development of generic guidelines for an\nunderground repository irrespective of the specific site.\nAfter its deliberations the society retained an open mind whether Sellafield has the potential\nto be the site for a deep underground repository. In the context of Nirex's current plans for\nsuch a repository it expressed concern in its recommendations about several issues. One of\nthese was the short timescale proposed:\nThe timetable of the programme needs to respect the fact that much of the science essential\nfor long-term performance of repositories for long-lived wastes is still at an early stage of\ndevelopment.\nThe society suggested splitting the research and development programmes into two. One\nprogramme would deal with short-lived ILW and some LLW for which repository\ncharacteristics are well established, the other requiring extra time and further work aimed at\nlong-lived ILW and possibly HLW:\nA more robust strategy for the UK would entail aiming to construct an initial part of the\nrepository for short-lived wastes within the zone of rock that Nirex are presently characterising\nin detail, with a more extended programme for the disposal of long-lived wastes, possibly in\na second-phase repository sited deeper and in a west-ward extension of the presently defined\npotential repository zone, but sharing common access and surface facilities. The practicability\nof disposing of high level wastes, as well as long-lived intermediate level wastes, in this\nsecond-phase repository could be investigated with advantage.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n20\n Disposal of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories, The Royal Society, November 1994\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nComments were also made that Nirex should make its research results more widely available\nand open for peer review, a criticism also expressed by others21:\nThe iterative process of developing post-closure performance assessments for UK deep\nrepositories for radioactive wastes should be open to wide scientific peer review, particularly\nthe databases, the interpretation of site-specific data and the analysis of assessment results for\nspecific potential repository sites. This would complement the peer review of Nirex generic\nresearch that already takes place through publication and international cooperation. The fact\nthat Nirex initiated the present study is a positive signal of willingness to seek external inputs\nto their scientific strategy.\nThe society recommended further research on the effect of future climate change and\ngroundwater movement to assist in the post-closure performance assessments:\nA range of scenarios to represent the possible long-term evolutions of conditions at repository\nsites, addressing the consequences of climate changes through future glacial periods, needs to\nbe developed in order to make substantial progress in assessing the post-closure performance\nof repositories for long-lived wastes.\nFor credible assessments of the long-term performance of repositories, there is a need for a\nmore profound understanding of groundwater movement in fractured rocks, particularly in\nresponse to the influence of climate change. For the macroscale, use should be made of\nobserved geochemistry and simulations of the historical conditions that have led to it. At an\nintermediate scale, fracture flow determined by tracer tests and other field experiments should\nbe used to improve knowledge of the relationships between fracture patterns and groundwater\nmovement, and hence to calibrate numerical models of flow.\nIn the previous paragraph 'macroscale' refers to the large-scale overview of the groundwater\nmovement, and 'tracer tests' are experiments in which a small (or trace) quantity of a\ndetectable substance is introduced into the groundwater at one point and by detecting where\nit emerges groundwater movement can be charted.\nIn conclusion the society recognised the need for an RCF and the role it will play in the\nestablishment of the safety case:\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n21\n Nature, 31 October 1996\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nThe \"rock characterisation facility\" (RCF) will provide a valuable base for site-specific studies,\nand should be operated for a long enough period to enable such studies to contribute\nsubstantially to detailed post-closure performance assessments. Nirex should encourage wide\ninternational participation in the planning and performance of experiments undertaken at the\nRCF, and in the interpretation of the experimental results.\nB. The RWMAC Report\nThe Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC) was established in 1978\nto advise the Government on civil radioactive waste management issues. In 1994 Nirex\ninvited RWMAC to carry out a review of its scientific mission for the proposed RCF. At\nthe same time Cumbria County Council also asked RWMAC to comment on a number of\nissues related to the RCF, including its potential role beyond its function as a rock laboratory\nfor generic purposes.\nThe RWMAC Report22 addressed all of these issues. In its conclusion the Report endorsed\nthe need for the RCF to enable the safety case to be made for the proposed repository.\nRWMAC expressed concern, however, about the timescale for the scientific programme and\nquestioned whether sufficient data would be available for the inquiry into the repository itself.\nIt also mentioned the need to use the RCF as an integral part of the repository to meet a\ncommissioning date for it of about 201023.\nThe RCF is an integral and necessary part of the overall Nirex science programme forming\nan essential step in establishing the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of\nconstruction. The timing of the RCF, in relation to the current overall Nirex programme, is\nsuch that only limited data will be available at the time that a planning application would be\nmade for the repository. It is, however, important that the results of the RCF programme be\navailable in time for that inquiry. For Nirex to have assurance of achieving the planned date\nfor commissioning of the repository by around 2010, then it would be necessary to use the\nRCF shafts for construction purposes.\nIt is this secondary use of the RCF which has led environmental groups to question whether\nthe RCF is a \"trojan horse\" for the repository24.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n22\n Review of aspects of the scientific mission and role of the Nirex Rock Characterisation Facility at Sellafield,\nRWMAC, September 1995\n23\n This date has slipped slightly to 2012 (Nature 31 October 1996)\n24\n UK Radioactive Waste Policy: Not a legacy to stand on, Greenpeace, December 1994 p5\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nC. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution Assessment\nHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) have carried out a highly technical assessment\nof the site characterisation near Sellafield25. In addition to a review of Nirex's reports,\nreviews have been carried out of the geology of the East Irish Sea Basin and fracturing within\nthe Borrowdale Volcanic Group where the repository is planned. The Assessment praises\nthe high quality of Nirex work:\nThe quality of work which Nirex have and are continuing to carry out in the Sellafield area\nis generally of a very high standard, with the quality of the core material and the care taken\nto achieve the highest quality results being admirable. Much of the work carried out is an\nobject lesson on how to carry out a site investigation. There is still, however, much left to\ndo and this section of the report sets out where data and understanding are still lacking, and\nwhere uncertainties remain.\nThe work reviewed and suggested is of a highly technical nature and is therefore not dealt\nwith here, but can be accessed in the Assessment itself if required. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n25\n HMIP Assessment of Nirex Proposals Performance Assessment Project (Phase 2), HMIP, October 1994\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nVII. Opposition from Environmental Groups\nTwo of the main environmental groups in the UK, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth\n(FOE), have differing perspectives upon disposal of radioactive waste.\nA. Greenpeace\nGreenpeace is wholly opposed to disposal (which it terms 'dumping') and would prefer storage\nso that waste would be retrievable26:\nThe problems of nuclear waste should be recognised as intractable. All that can be hoped for\nis a 'least bad' approach that takes account of public concern and minimises the burdens on\nfuture generations. Nuclear waste should be stored, monitored, and retrieved if something\ngoes wrong. Dumping is an irreversible commitment of nuclear waste to the environment.\nThe only solution is to stop nuclear waste production at source. That means closing down\nBritain's nuclear power stations and plutonium reprocessing factories.\nGreenpeace has specific objection to the choice of the site near Sellafield for the repository.\nIt questions the grounds upon which the decision was based: was it scientific evidence or\npolitical expediency27.\nThe site has been described by Sir Hugh Rossi MP, former Chairman of the Environment\nSelect Committee of the House of Commons, as politically 'the easiest solution', being in an\narea where the public are dependent on the nuclear industry for their livelihoods. At the same\ntime, geological criteria for site selection have been ignored.\nThe properties of the rock in which the waste is to be buried are intended to help isolate it\nfrom the environment for hundreds of thousands of years, but Nirex have broken UK,\nEuropean Community and International Atomic Energy Authority guidelines in their\nchoice of site:\nThe proposed dump is in a major fault zone.\nRadioactive springs forming as a result of an earthquake in the area could supply\ndrinking water. Springs have formed in the recent past following an earthquake\nalong the same fault zone.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n26\n UK Radioactive Waste Policy: Not a legacy to stand on, Greenpeace, December 1994\n27\n Earthquake, Greenpeace, November 1994\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nThe site is too complicated for scientists to work out if it is safe.\nNirex don't know where all the fractures are that could take water back to the surface\nfrom the dump, or how fast water will flow through them and the numerous different\nrock types. Only one connective fracture is required to supply a radioactive spring\nto the surface.\nWater will flow from the waste towards the surface and fractures provide fast flow\nroutes.\nRadioactive water could reach the surface long before it is safe.\nThe proposed dump is below a sandstone aquifer that is an important water resource.\nFuture generations could dig a well and pump up radioactive water to drink.\nIn other countries the site would be excluded from consideration for a deep dump. The\nincreased radiation risks to the public and environment due to such poor site selection are\nimpossible to quantify. The risk to individuals of death from cancer due to leaking\nradioactive substance is likely to be far higher than at other sites, and is known with even less\ncertainty. The UK government, far from dealing with the problems, has recently proposed\nweakening the regulations, so that the current risk limit no longer has to be met.\nThe proposed weakening of regulations is amplified by Greenpeace elsewhere28:\nWeakening Standards. The Government is proposing to weaken standards of protection from\nman-made radiation sources. Current regulations (the 1984 Green Book) state that the risk of\nfatal cancer in an individual due to all man made sources, excluding medical, should not\nexceed 1 in 100,000 in any one year. This led to a dose limit of 1 milli-sievert for an\nindividual. It is now believed that the risk of death associated with this dose (1 milli-sievert)\nis five times higher - 1 death in 20,000. So rather than change the dose limits to correct the\nmistake and restore a risk of 1 in 100,000 the current proposal is to keep the limit the same\nand accept five times the risk.  New dose limits should be defined to correct the mistake\nmade.\nIn the conclusion to its closing submission to the public inquiry Greenpeace summarised its\nreasons for recommending that the application for the RCF at Longlands Farm be refused as\nfollows29:\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n28\n UK Radioactive Waste Policy: Not a legacy to stand on, Greenpeace, December 1994\n29\n Radioactive waste disposal at Sellafield, UK edited by RS Haszeldine and DK Smythe (p204)\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\n(a) the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development will meet its stated purpose.\nIt is highly unlikely, if not impossible, in Greenpeace's view that the RCF will ever\nsufficiently characterise the site for a Detailed Safety Assessment to be made;\n(b) alternatively, if the RCF could achieve its purpose, which is unlikely, then it will become\nan integral part to the development of a Deep Waste Repository (DWR). However, one\ncannot be confident that the Nirex approach so far will provide the greatest measure of\nradiological safety to the public, and the significant economic commitment to the site at this\nstage may lead to greater risks;\n(c) Nirex has failed to provide any reliable assessments of results of its investigation\nprogramme so far. It is therefore not possible to determine what benefits, if any, could be\ngained from obtaining additional information from the RCF;\n(d) alternative sites exist which appear to offer significantly better levels of safety. It is\nimperative whilst disposal remains Government policy, that those sites are fully investigated\nif there is to be any development of a DWR in the UK.\nB. Friends of the Earth\nFOE, on the other hand, is not opposed to disposal in principle. Its aim is to ensure a\nsustainable policy for both energy and the radioactive waste that results 30:\n1.2 Within FOE, the Energy, Nuclear and Climate Campaign, which was launched in\n1973, is one of its longest running campaigns. Its principal aim is to promote a safe\nand sustainable energy policy at all levels of energy supply and use, both in the UK\nand internationally. The second of the Campaign's goals is to ensure that \"the\nradioactive legacy resulting from the use of nuclear power is managed and passed on\nto future generations in the least environmentally damaging way possible.\"\nFOE is not opposed in principle to the proposed RCF, but considers the planning application\nto be premature31:\n\"Within the staged development of a nuclear waste repository construction of a Rock\nCharacterisation Facility will be required. However, it is critically important that RCF\nconstruction is not undertaken prematurely.\" FOE's case demonstrates that the current\napplication is premature. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n30\n Closing Statement of FOE at the Public Planning Inquiry into the RCF,  FOE, 1996\n31\n Radioactive waste disposal at Sellafield, UK  edited by RS Haszeldine and DK Smythe (p204) \n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nIts Statement of Case at the Inquiry is more specific about the scientific investigations\nrequired before a planning application is made32:\n\"FOE contends, and will call evidence to show, that by carrying out an inadequate site\nselection exercise Nirex has selected a site for the RCF which is geologically complex and has\na complicated groundwater flow pattern about which it still has an inadequate understanding.\nFOE will show that because of the damage that proceeding with the RCF would cause\nplanning permission should not be granted for the RCF until such time as Nirex has gained\nan adequate appreciation of the full nature and complexities of the site. FOE further contends\nthat to proceed with the RCF before adequate investigations have been carried out, will render\na properly justified decision about whether the site is suitable for a repository much more\ndifficult to take and may make it impossible.\"\nC. Other Groups\nThe Consortium of Opposing Local Authorities (COLA) which bases its case largely upon\nthe studies by FOE, the Royal Society and HMIP, is opposed to the deep repository near\nSellafield for safety reasons33.\nCumbria County Council has also concluded that there is a significant likelihood that a\nsafety case for the development of a repository at Sellafield cannot be made and that it is \"a\npoor site chosen for the wrong reasons\"34. It argues that there is a clear alternative to the\nSellafield site known as Site 6 in Nirex evidence. This is in eastern Europe35:\nThe County Council believes that the decision by the Nirex Board to reject this alternative\nsite, which is geologically and radiologically superior to Sellafield, was unsound and that it\nis not sensible to enter into the commitment that the RCF represents when this alternative still\nmerits serious investigation.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n32\n Radioactive waste disposal at Sellafield, UK  edited by RS Haszeldine and DK Smythe (p204) \n33\n Nuclear Waste Disposal: Some Fundamental Uncertainties, No 19 COLA, January 1996\n34\n G Richardson A Poor Site Chosen for the Wrong Reasons, Cumbria County Council News Release, 27\nNovember 1995\n35\n New information from Nirex Shows Better Alternative to Sellafield, Cumbria County Council News Release,\n31 October 1995\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nVIII. Deep disposal in geological formations in other\ncountries\nDeep geological disposal for HLW, spent fuel (which is classed as HLW), and ILW of long\nhalf-life is considered to be safe and is a feature of radioactive waste management polices in\nmany countries. In fact every western country with a significant nuclear programme operates\nor is planning for deep geological disposal. In comparison with other countries, the UK's\npolicy for such a disposal route for ILW and some LLW would seem conservative.\nThe design of individual facilities vary and are determined largely by the geology of the site.\nIn many countries the use of in situ investigation facilities, such as boreholes or an\nunderground research laboratory (URL) similar to the RCF are a preliminary to the final\ndesign process for a repository.\nIn a number of countries repositories have been located in existing underground mines where\nthere are already in situ laboratories (Germany). In some countries where site selection has\nnot been finalised a 'reference' URL (i.e. at a trial site) is considered suitable (Canada and\nJapan). Other countries may construct a URL at a later stage of the process for site selection\n(France and USA), whilst others may not require a URL at all (Finland).\nThe position in a number of countries was fully described in Nuclear Energy36 early in 1994\nfrom which the following extracts are taken:\nGermany\nGermany intends to dispose of all its radioactive wastes (and, separately, its toxic wastes) in\ndeep geological formations. Prior to reunification, East Germany used the abandoned\nBartensleben salt mine, near the town of Morsleben, as a repository for LLW and ILW. Some\n450m deep, it has a capacity of 15,000 cubic metres and began operation in 1979. Recently,\nthe German courts granted permission for its continued operation until the year 2000, when\na new licence will be sought. There had been some concern over its operations but on\nexamination by the West Germany radio-active waste disposal agency, DBE, these were not\nfound to be wanting.\nThe former iron ore mine at Konrad in Lower Saxony will, if found suitable, become the\nrepository for all non-heat generating wastes. It lies at depths of between 800-1300m,\noverlain by clay. A decision on the commencement of waste emplacement is expected by\nmid-1994.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n36\n Nuclear Energy: Special Issue - The Nirex Repository, February 1994\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nThe Gorleben repository, also in Lower Saxony, will take all wastes including heat-generating\nand spend fuel. The intended depth is about 900m in a salt dome underlying a gypsum rock\ncap. Shaft sinking started in 1986 and extensive underground tests to determine the\ngeological structure and draw up the detailed repository design are due to be completed in the\nlate 1990s. Construction is due to start at that time with the repository becoming operational\nin 2008.\nResearch and development into disposal in salt has been carried out at the former Asse salt\nmine since 1965 at depths of down to 1000m. Demonstrations of LLW and ILW disposal\nwere carried out until 1978 but work recently had focused on HLW disposal.\nFrance \nFrance has a significant spent-fuel reprocessing industry and spent fuel is regarded as a\nresource. It is committed through legislation to research deep disposal of long-lived wastes\nin rock laboratories at two candidate sites. The selection programme for these was announced\nin March 1992 and the choice of potential sites may be announced later this year. It is\nintended to ensure that a range of options will be available when disposal decisions are made\nin about 15 years time. This will necessitate a change in the law. Given a favourable\ndecision by the Government, a 400-1000m deep repository is intended at one of the URL\nsites\nUSA\nDeep geological disposal is the method chosen by the USA for TRU37 waste and HLW. A\nwaste isolation pilot plant (WIPP) for a defence TRU waste repository in a salt formation is\nlocated in New Mexico at a depth of 700m. The 1985 Nuclear Waste Policy Act gave the go\nahead for the search of potential sites for a deep repository to take HLW and civilian TRU\nwaste. In 1987 the law was amended to direct the US Department of Energy to evaluate only\nthe Yucca Mountain site in Nevada. Site characterization began in July 1991 and construction\nof a URL (known here as the Experimental Studies Facility or ESF) has now started. Should\nthe site prove acceptable, a licence application will be made to construct a repository. The\nearliest waste emplacement operations would begin is 2010. The Department of Energy is\nintending to build a monitorable retrievable store (MRS) to serve as a holding facility until\nthe repository is ready. No site for this has yet been identified, but it is hoped that a State\nor Indian Tribe will volunteer to host an MRS.\nBelgium\nBelgium, which has some of its fuel reprocessed, intends to dispose of its HLW and alpha-\nbearing wastes in a deep-clay formation at Mol-Dessel nuclear site. A 230m deep URL has\nbeen in operation there since 1984 (known as HADES and part-financed by the EC). Should\nexperiments in the URL show the site to be satisfactory, it is intended to begin repository\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n37\n In this journal extract TRU is the acronym for tans-uranic waste, ie waste from the break-down of uranium\natoms in a nuclear reactor which are themselves radioactive. In other parts of this Research Paper the term\nfission products is used.\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nconstruction in 2030 and commence disposal in 2040, subject of course to a successful\nlicensing process.\nCanada\nThe Canadian concept is that HLW disposal should be in stable granite formations of the\nCanadian Shield at a depth of between 500-1000m. A major component of the disposal\nprogramme is the URL at Lac du Bonnet batholith near the Whiteshell Laboratories at Pinawa,\nManitoba, 100km from Winnipeg. Excavation of this commenced in 1986 and is now below\n400m. It is not intended that Whiteshell becomes the eventual repository, but it will provide\nthe geological characterization methodology for candidate sites.\nA very lengthy environmental assessment of a generic repository design is required prior to\nthe submission of the proposal for a site-specific facility. Subject to this, it is planned to have\nan actual repository operational by 2025.\nJapan\nSince 1977, the Japanese have been running a site selection procedure for a deep repository.\nA number of underground experiments have been carried out at existing quarries, an uranium\nmine and other underground facilities. A dedicated URL on the north island is intended, but\nadoption of a new policy in 1992 means that this will not be the final repository. HLW\ndisposal will not take place for may decades to come.\nSpain\nSpain commenced an HLW repository site selection programme in 1986 - a final choice is to\nbe made by the year 2000. Construction is planned to start in 2015 leading to a repository\noperational date of 2020. Generic design are being considered for a repository in salt, granite\nand clay formations; two have been developed. When a decision has been made by the\nGovernment on the rock type to be used, an initial validation laboratory will be excavated, but\nthis would not necessarily be the repository site.\nFinland\nIn Finland, after an initial screening exercise for a spent-fuel repository in the mid-1980s, five\nsites were chosen for preliminary investigation. This was completed at the end of 1992 and\nthree of these have now been designated for detailed field studies to the year 2000. One site\nwill then be chosen for supplementary investigations until 2010. A licence application will\nfollow with commissioning planned for the year 2020. This repository will take the fuel from\nOlkiluoto. The fuel from the Soviet-built Loviisa power station will be returned to Russia\nfor reprocessing, but there is no intention for any associated wastes to be returned to Finland.\nSweden\nBetween 1980 and 1992, Sweden ran an international URL project in a 400m deep abandoned\niron-ore mine at Stripa. The project was wound down and a new project begun below the\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nisland of Äspö. This is planned to continue until the year 2010. Construction of the access\ntunnel commenced in 1990 and is currently below 200m, with an eventual depth of 500m.\nSweden began looking for a final deposal site for HLW in 1977. Eight sites have been\nstudied closely and two or three sites are due to be selected this year for more detailed\ncharacterization. A final selection will be made at the end of the century with the intention\nof starting spent-fuel disposal in 2008 - two years ahead of the planned date for reactor\nclosure, decided following a referendum. A repository at Äspö, incorporating laboratory\nexcavations, is unlikely. However this would not preclude the choice of another site in the\nregion.\nSwitzerland\nThe Swiss intended to reprocess some fuel in France and the UK. They will dispose of the\nreturned waste in a 1200m deep HLW repository, which will be ready for operation by 2020.\nThe site selection programme is at present looking at four sites in the north of the country,\nwith one being selected for further detailed characterization in 1997. A deep URL will be\nconstructed at that location. In the meantime, since 1984, underground experiments have been\ncarried out at the Grimsel test site in the Alps, but this will not be a repository location. The\nfacility is situated about 1km inside the mountain which provides a 450m rock overburden.\n25\n\n\nSubject Headings:\nEnergy\nEnvironmental Issues\nScience and Technology\n\n\nRecent Research Papers on related subjects include:\n94/31  The Nuclear Review 17.02.96 \n95/03 Nuclear Privatisation 15.01.96 \n96/30 Radioactive Waste: Some Topical Issues 29.02.96\n96/83 Decommission of Nuclear Power Stations 1994/95) 18.07.96 \n  \n\n\n\n"

          "Unemployment by Constituency\nNovember 1996\nResearch Paper 96/116\n18 December 1996\nOfficial monthly unemployment rates for parliamentary constituencies only exist for those few\nconstituencies which are self-contained labour markets. This paper presents up-to-date\nresidence-based unemployment rates not published elsewhere for all 651 constituencies in the\nUK, using figures for the number of unemployed claimants from the monthly count and data\nfor the economically active population from the 1991 Census of Population. \nIn May 1996 the Office for National Statistics moved to a 1991 ward base for the\nunemployment statistics. This means that for many constituencies it is no longer possible to\nmake direct comparisons with previously published data. As a result, this Paper no longer\nincludes a table on changes in the level of unemployment in recent years. Research Paper\n96/63 provides a guide to the methodology and to which constituencies are affected by the\nchange in the geographical base.\nJane Dyson\nEconomic Policy Alison Penman\n& Statistics Section Statistics Resource Unit\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n                                                                   \nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not published elsewhere. These use figures for the number of unemployed\nclaimants from the monthly count and figures for the number of people economically active\nderived from the 1991 Census of Population. \nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour, as they take no account of people's ability to seek work outside the constituency\nin which they live. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nthe Research Paper 96/63.\nThe data contained in this Paper are generally not comparable with figures published in this\nseries of Papers of this series prior to May 1996. This is because in May 1996 the ONS\nchanged the geographical basis of the monthly claimant count. Previously, the monthly\nfigures have related to parliamentary constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1981 wards.\nFrom the April 1996 figures onwards, data are based on constituencies defined in terms of\nfrozen 1991 wards. Whilst figures for January, February and March 1996 were re-released\non the new basis, back-runs of figures for dates prior to 1996 will not be published. For\nmany constituencies therefore, there will be a discontinuity in the figures at the end of 1995.\nFor this reason it is no longer possible to produce tables showing the change in the number\nof claimants 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ago. \nNotes to tables:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The\nfollowing abbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\nVAC Vacant seat\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/116\n2. The data from the 1991 Census of Population used for the denominators in calculating\nresidence-based unemployment rates were obtained from the dataset known as the\nLocal Base Statistics. In the case of the Censuses for England and Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland, the raw data relate to areas known as \"Enumeration Districts\".\nThese data are first aggregated into electoral wards and then wards are aggregated to\nform constituency totals. In Scotland the raw data relate to \"Output Areas\". These\nfigures are not available at a ward level but are aggregated directly into higher level\ngeographical areas such as constituencies and districts.\nThere is inevitably a time-lag between changes in electoral ward boundaries being\nincorporated into parliamentary constituencies. This means that wards are not always\ncoterminous with constituencies. Where this is the case, wards have been best-fitted\nto constituencies on the basis of the constituency where the majority of the population\nare thought to live. Those constituencies where such a process has been employed are\ndenoted \"***\" in all the tables in this paper.\n3.

          "Welfare-to-Work: The New Deal\nResearch Paper 97/118\n12 November 1997\nTim Jarvis\nBusiness and Transport Section\nIn the Labour Government's first Budget after the May 1997 General Election, Gordon Brown,\nChancellor of the Exchequer, announced a range of proposals designed to help people on benefits\nreturn to work.  The schemes are to be funded by money raised by the windfall tax on the\nprivatised utilities and form part of the Government's Welfare-to-Work strategy.  This paper\nexamines the New Deal proposals for Young People, the Long-term Unemployed and Lone\nParents.  It is confined to those schemes financed by the windfall tax and does not attempt to deal\nwith other potential elements of the Welfare-to-Work strategy such as the possible introduction of\nearned income tax credits.\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

The windfall tax is expected to raise £5.2 billion over the period 1997-9, while the\nWelfare-to-Work measures described in this paper are expected to cost £3.9 billion over the five\nyears 1997-2002.2\nThe plans place the emphasis on recruitment subsidies as an attempt to prevent long-term\nunemployment, and work experience and training for the young to increase the skills base in\nthe labour supply and reduce the risk of young people falling into long-term unemployment.\nAdvice on benefits, child-care, training and job search techniques are central to the plans for\nlone parents.  Proposals are to be phased in over the next 2 years.  Pilot studies for the New\nDeal for Lone Parents began in July this year and the New Deal for Young People will be\noffered in the pathfinder areas from January 1998.  All the schemes are expected to be\navailable nationwide by the Autumn of 1998.\nActive labour market policies have been pursued in a number of countries over the last few\nyears and the Labour Party appears to have drawn on the experience of these schemes in\ndeveloping its own policies.  Critics have also analysed the effectiveness of these\nprogrammes in assessing the likely effects of the Government proposals and this paper\nattempts to summarise the large amount of material produced, particularly on wage subsidies.\nLessons can also be learnt from the experience of pilot job subsidy schemes such as\nWorkstart in this country.\nThe latest figures showing the numbers of people in each New Deal category are included as\nan appendix to this paper.  House of Commons Library Research Paper 97/117 by Jane\nDyson, Economics Policy and Statistics Section, lists the figures in the new deal categories\nfor each Parliamentary constituency.\nThe New Deal proposals consist predominantly of employment and training schemes and as\nsuch they do not require new legislation.  However, the Government will be seeking to\namend the Jobseekers Allowance Regulations 1996 in order to extend benefit sanctions to\nthose claimants on the New Deal for Young People who refuse to take up one of the available\noptions.\n1\n \nNew Labour because Britain deserves better, Labour's manifesto for the 1997 General Election, p 19.\n2\n \nEquipping Britain for our long-term future: Financial Statement and Budget Report, HC 85, July 1997, p.33\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n6\nII The Proposals\nA.\n \nThe New Deal for Young People\nThe programme for the young unemployed was foreshadowed in Labour Party policy\ndocuments before the 1997 General Election.  One of the \"five election pledges\" highlighted\nin Labour's election manifesto was to \"get 250,000 under-25 year-olds off benefit and into\nwork by using money from a windfall levy on the privatised utilities\".  The formal\nannouncement, however, came in Gordon Brown's first Budget on 2 July 1997:3\nIn the new economy, in which capital, inventions and even raw materials are\nmobile, Britain has only one truly national resource: the talent and potential of\nits people. Yet in Britain today, one in five of working-age households have\nno one earning a wage. In place of welfare, there should be work. So today\nthis Budget is taking the first steps to create the new welfare state for the 2lst\ncentury.\nThe welfare state was and remains a great British achievement. It was set up to\nprovide security for all, and opportunity for all, goals that are as relevant today\nas in 1945. But for millions out of work or suffering poverty in work, the\nwelfare state today denies rather than provides opportunity. So it is time for\nthe welfare state to put opportunity back into people's hands.\nFirst, everyone in need of work should have the opportunity to work.\nSecondly, we must ensure that work pays. Thirdly, everyone who seeks to\nadvance through employment and education must be given the means to\nadvance. So we will create a new ladder of opportunity that will allow the\nmany, by their own efforts, to benefit from opportunities once open only to a\nfew.\nStarting from next year, every young person aged 18 to 25 who is unemployed\nfor more than six months will be offered a first step on the employment ladder.\nTomorrow, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and\nEmployment will detail the four options, all involving training leading to\nqualifications--a job with an employer; work with a voluntary organisation;\nwork on the environmental task force; and, for those without basic\nqualifications, the chance of full-time education or training.\nWith those new opportunities for young people come new responsibilities.\nThere will be no fifth option--to stay at home on full benefit. So when they\n3\n HC Deb 2 July 1997 cc 308-309\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n7\nsign on for benefit, they will be signing up for work. Benefits will be cut if\nyoung people refuse to take up the opportunities. This new deal for the young\nis comprehensive, rich in opportunity, linked to the development of skills and\nhas already attracted the support of some of Britain's leading companies.\nI urge every business to play its part in this national crusade to equip this\ncountry for the future by taking on young unemployed men and women. I\nappeal to every voluntary organisation to make a further contribution to the\nwork that they do in the community by taking on a young person. I will make\nit possible for every Member of the House to act as an ambassador for this\nventure, encouraging young people in their constituencies, consulting local\nbusinesses and bringing them together to play their part in this new deal for\nyoung people.\nThe New Deal for Young People will commence in 12 \"pathfinder areas\" in January 1998.\nThe pathfinder areas, announced on 28 July 1997, are Tayside, Swansea and West Wales,\nSheffield and Rotherham, Eastbourne, Lambeth, Harlow and Stevenage, Cumbria, Wirral,\nSouth Derbyshire, Black Country (North and South), Newcastle (including Gateshead and\nSouth Tyne), and Cornwall.4  The programme will be introduced nationwide in April 1998.\nThe Department for Education and Employment has published details of the programme in its\ndocument Design of the New Deal for 18-24 year olds.5  The programme will cover all young\npeople aged 18-24 who have been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) for six months or\nmore. The stock of 18-24 year olds who will have already been unemployed for 6 months\nwhen the New Deal is introduced will enter the Gateway (the first stage of the New Deal\nprogramme) when they reach their Restart interview.  These take place every 6 months.\nYoung people who reach 6 months of unemployment after the introduction of the New Deal\nwill enter the programme immediately.  There is provision for entering the New Deal early at\nthe discretion of the Employment Service but certain groups will be able to automatically\nenter early if they wish.  These groups include lone parents, people whose first language is\nnot English or Welsh, ex-offenders, those who have become unemployed as a result of large\nscale redundancies and people leaving care.\n1. The Gateway\nThe New Deal will begin with an intensive period of advice, counselling and guidance known\nas the \"Gateway\" to the New Deal.  This will be a period of up to 4 months during which an\nEmployment Service (ES) personal adviser will introduce the participant to the New Deal and\n4\n HC Deb 28 July 1997 cc 49-52W\n5\n DfEE October 1997.\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n8\nexplain his or her rights and responsibilities.  The DfEE stress that all New Deal services will\nbe tailored to local needs but each Gateway should contain:\n• An initial phase of intensive help to find jobs\n• Advice and guidance to assess the action needed to find work\n• Access to independent careers advice\n• Help with jobsearch techniques\n• Basic skills courses and 'taster' placements on one of the 4 options for those\nwho need them\n• Help from specialist agencies for those with particular problems such as\nhomelessness or drug dependency\n• An action plan to be retained throughout the New Deal and updated as\nnecessary.\nThe DfEE expect that Gateway services and options will be procured through competitive\ntendering.6  Each participant will have an ES adviser who will oversee the process.\nIf they are still unemployed after the Gateway, participants will be offered one of four\noptions.  The DfEE expect that young people will be able to choose which of the four\n6\n Op cit, New Deal Design, p. 3.\noptions they wish to pursue and that at the very least they will be able to choose between two\nof the four options.  The restrictions in the eligibility criteria for the Education and Training\noption will mean a number of people will only have access to the three remaining options.\nThese people will choose from at least two of the remaining three options.\n2. The Employment Option\nWhen a participant has been on the Gateway for two months the personal adviser will issue a\nverification certificate ('voucher') that confirms the jobseeker is eligible for a subsidy if\nplaced in a job.  Once the participant is placed, the employer will receive £60 a week for up\nto 26 weeks.  To be eligible for the subsidy the post must offer an average of at least 30 hours\nper week including the time spent training.  Posts offering between 24 and 29 hours per week\nwill attract a subsidy of £40 per week for a period of up to 26 weeks.  Vacancies offering less\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n9\nthan 24 hours per week will only attract a subsidy for those participants who are unable to\nwork more hours due to disability or caring responsibilities.\nThe post must also offer at least one day per week of training (or its equivalent) towards an\naccredited qualification.  A training payment of  £750 per person will be allocated to finance\nthe associated training.7   The public sector will be able to recruit young people under the\nscheme but it is expected that \"the large majority of places on the New Deal Employment\noption will be in the private sector reflecting the balance in the workforce as a whole\".8\nIt will also be possible for the ES to contract with partner organisations, such as Training and\nEnterprise Councils (TECs), in order to secure employment options.  In these circumstances\nsubsidy payments will be made to the partners and they will be responsible for passing it on\nto the employer.\nAll employers (and partner organisations, if applicable) will be required to sign an employer's\nagreement that will include a commitment that:\n• Where the participant shows the necessary aptitude, and unless agreed in\nadvance with the ES, the post will continue unsubsidised beyond the 6\nmonths;\n• If this is not possible employers will support the participant's efforts to secure\nalternative employment or training;\n• Existing employees are not made redundant to create jobs for people\nattracting a subsidy;\n• Employers do not make a direct cash profit and that the New Deal employee\ncosts in wages at least as much as they receive in subsidy, with New Deal\nemployees receiving the normal rate for the post.\nEmployment agencies will also be able to take on people on the New Deal but they will also\nhave to sign the employer guarantee and offer work and appropriate training for at least 6\nmonths.\nSome time after the New Deal had been launched in the Budget, it was announced that there\nwill also be an option of help for young people who wish to become self-employed.  Young\npeople interested in this option can put forward a business plan during the Gateway and if this\nis accepted this will form the basis for a programme during the New Deal period.  Specific\ntraining will be given in bookkeeping, marketing and other business areas.  The ES will\n7\n Equipping Britain for our long-term future: Financial statement and Budget Report, HC 85, July 1997, p 31\n8\n Op cit, New Deal Design, p.17.\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n10\ncontract out provision of specialist training and advice to other parties, such as the Prince's\nYouth Business Trust.  Participants in this option will receive benefit plus a grant of up to\n£400 paid as a weekly allowance.9\n3.  Voluntary Sector and the Environment Taskforce\nThese options will involve a job for six months with either the Environment Taskforce or a\nvoluntary sector employer.  Both options will include day release education or training\ntowards accredited qualifications.10  The Taskforce will engage young people on projects of\nbenefit to the whole community, including projects to help meet the Government's targets for\nheat conservation and efficiency.11 The voluntary sector option will include a particular\nemphasis on placements to provide 50,000 new trained childcarers.12  Participants in both\noptions will receive an allowance equivalent to benefit and will remain entitled to passported\nbenefits.  In addition, they will receive a grant of up to £400 paid in weekly or fortnightly\ninstalments.  This is equivalent to approximately £15 per week plus benefits.  The provider\nwill also reimburse participants for agreed weekly travel costs above the first £4.\nThe core elements of provision in these option are:\n• Each placement will be for a minimum of 30 hours per week over five full\ndays including one day or its equivalent spent on training towards an\naccredited qualification;\n• All placements should offer participants the opportunity to demonstrate work\nskills likely to be attractive to employers, such as time management and team\nworking;\n• Each placement will include an induction period to explain the project and\ncover health and safety issues;\n• A personal development plan to structure the participant's development during\nthe placement to be agreed between the provider and the participant.\nUpon completion of the placement, the participant will receive a certificate and a work\nreference from the provider.\n9\n \"New deal to turn jobless into job creators\", DfEE press release, 30 September 1997.\n10\n DfEE Press Release, 3 July 1997\n11\n HC 85, July 1997, p 31\n12\n Ibid\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n11\nThe content of each placement will vary from area to area but the Government has indicated\nthe type of work in which it expects participants to be engaged:13\nWork done on the Environment Task Force will contribute to the improvement\nof the local, regional or global environment and be compatible with\nsustainable development in line with the government's policies and objectives.\nThe government is keen to encourage projects which will contribute to\nconserving energy and water and protecting the environment, and those which\noffer opportunities for young people to become involved in local communities\nresulting in regenerated local communities or contributing towards greening\nurban or fringe areas.  Projects could include, for example, dealing with\nhousing, forest and park management, and reclamation of derelict or waste\nland.\nThe voluntary sector option aims to deliver a range of benefits to the local\ncommunity.  These could include improving the Voluntary Sector's capacity to\ndeliver its services to clients by reducing the risk of re-offending or drug\nmisuse by the young people involved; by improving the availability of\nchildcare; by establishing new programmes of community benefit; or by\ninfluencing indirect benefits such as improved community relations and\ngreater community safety.\n4. The Education Option\nThis option will be primarily open to those participants in the New Deal without N/SVQ\nLevel 2 or equivalent GCSE level qualifications.14  A list of the courses and relevant\nqualifications that it will be possible to pursue under this option is contained in Schedule 2 to\nthe Further and Higher Education Act 1992 reproduced in Appendix I.\nParticipants in this option will be offered:\n• Up to 52 weeks of full-time education and training on a course leading to an\napproved qualification;\n• A period of structured induction;\n• Training and support in job skills;\n13\n Op cit Design of the New Deal, p. 27\n14\n This is likely to be approximately 3 or 4 GCSEs at grade C or above.\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n12\n• Training within a realistic work environment;\n• A personal tutor acting as the main contact;\n• A record of achievement.\nThe approved qualifications are listed in Schedule 2 to the Further and Higher Education Act\n1992 and this is reproduced as an appendix to this paper.\nProviders will be expected to cover the cost of training materials and travel expenses.  They\nwill receive funding according to categories to be established for low, medium and high cost\nprovision.  Funding will be linked to attendance whilst the participant is following the agreed\ncourse of study.  The funding model is designed with the intention of reflecting the\nemployment focus of the programme.  The DfEE argues that training providers will not be\npenalised where participants leave early to take up employment, as a commitment by the new\nemployer to continue participation on the agreed training plan will enable training providers\nto receive the full balance of funding when a qualification is obtained.15  It is less clear\nwhether they will be able to claim for losses incurred if the new employer does not agree to\ncontinued participation.  Participants will receive an allowance equivalent to their usual\nbenefit and will retain entitlement to passported benefits such as housing benefit.  A\ndiscretionary fund will be available to cover items such as exceptional travel costs or\nchildcare.\n5. Benefit Sanctions\nYoung people who fail to take up an option will be required to take a place identified for\nthem by the Employment Service.  If they do not, benefit sanctions will be applied.16  The\nstandard JSA benefit sanction for failing to go on a compulsory programme or obey a\njobseeker's Direction is a loss of the JSA personal allowance for two weeks or a loss of the\nJSA personal allowance for four weeks if a similar sanction has been imposed in the previous\n12 months.  This will be a 100% loss of benefits for up to four-weeks with hardship payments\nmade in only extreme cases.\n6. Cost and Numbers\n15\n Op cit New Deal Design p.23\n16\n DfEE Press Release, 3 July 1997\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n13\nThere are currently 122,000 young people who have been out of work or training for more\nthan six months.17  Thousands more pass this threshold every month.  The Government is\ncommitted to offering them each a place on the New Deal but based its original costings on a\ntarget of 250,000.  The apparent likelihood that the numbers eligible for the New Deal will be\nsignificantly less by the time it goes nationwide has led to speculation that the resources\nallocated for this client group may be redirected. In his evidence to the Employment\nCommittee, Andrew Smith, Employment Minister, confirmed that a continued fall in\nunemployment amongst young people may lead to a change of emphasis:18\nIf the number of young unemployed for more than six months fell significantly\nbelow our target (which is 250,000) this would release resources that could be\nconsidered for opportunities elsewhere.\nA total of £3,150 million from the windfall tax has been allocated to the programme over the\nperiod 1997-02:19\n1997-98 £100m\n1998-99 £700m\n1999-00 £830m\n2000-01 £770m\n2001-02 £740m\nB. New Deal for the Long-term Unemployed\nLabour's manifesto promised to \"encourage employers to take on those who have suffered\nunemployment for more than two years with a £75-a-week tax rebate paid for six months,\nfinanced by the windfall levy\".  The formal announcement came in the Budget statement on 2\nJuly 1997.20  The programme will start in June 1998\nThere are two elements to the New Deal for the Long-term Unemployed:\n• payments of £75 per week for 26 weeks to employers who recruit people aged\n25 and over who have been unemployed for two years or more; and\n17\n see Appendix I\n18\n \"Welfare to work may focus on older jobless\", Financial Times, 26 September 1997.\n19\n HC 85, July 1997, p 33\n20\n HC Deb 2 July 1997, c 309\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n14\n• opportunities for those unemployed for two years or more to study for up to\ntwelve months in full time employment-related courses designed to reach an\naccredited qualification.  This will be achieved by relaxing the 16 hour rule\nwhich prevents unemployed people from receiving benefit while studying\nfull-time.\nA total of £350 million from the windfall tax has been allocated to the programme over the\nperiod 1997-2002:21\n1997-98 £0m\n1998-99 £100m\n1999-00 £80m\n2000-01 £80m\n2001-02 £80m\nC. New Deal for Lone Parents\nUnder the New Deal for Lone Parents, claimants with school age children will be invited into\ntheir local job centre and offered help and advice on jobs, training and childcare.  Each\nindividual will have a personal caseworker who will develop an individual plan of action for\nthe claimant and allow them access to the services provided by the Employment Service.\nThere are currently approximately 1 million lone parents claiming benefit and the scheme\nwill be available to half a million of these with children of school age.  The programme\nstarted for 40,000 lone parents in 8 parts of the country from July 1997.  The 8 areas\nconcerned are Cambridgeshire, Warwickshire, Cardiff and Vale, Sheffield East, North\nCheshire, North Worcestershire, Clyde Valley and North Surrey.  The full national\nprogramme will start in October 1998.\nA total of £200 million from the windfall tax has been allocated to the New Deal for Lone\nParents over the period 1997-2002:22\n1997-98 £0m\n1998-99 £40m\n1999-00 £50m\n2000-01 £60m\n2001-02 £60m\n21\n HC 85, July 1997, p 33\n22\n Ibid\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n15\nThe Government has also announced two changes to the childcare disregards for Family\nCredit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit to encourage lone parents to return to work:\n• for families with two or more children the maximum allowance for childcare\ncosts will be increased from £60 to £100;\n• the maximum age of the child for eligibility for such disregards is to be\nincreased from 11 to 12.\nThese changes take effect from Summer 1998.  The Government's national childcare strategy\nis also intended to improve both the amount of provision and the cost of childcare for parents\nwho wish to work.  It is anticipated the New Deal for Young People will create places for\n50,000 trainee child carers and money from the National Lottery will be used to fund after-\nschool clubs.23\nThe programme for lone parents is voluntary and those who choose not to take part will not\nface benefit sanctions.24  However, lone parents who take part will be fast tracked for help\nwith Family Credit by the Benefits Agency and child maintenance by the Child Support\nAgency.25\nD. Employment Zones\n A proposal to create Employment Zones was included in the Labour Party manifesto:26\nWe favour initiatives with new combinations of available benefits to suit\nindividual circumstances.  In new and innovative 'Employment Zones',\npersonal job accounts will combine money currently available for benefits and\ntraining, to offer the unemployed new options  - leading to work and\nindependence.  We will co-ordinate benefits, employment and career services,\nand utilise new technology to improve their quality and efficiency.\nThe Government is planning to create Zones in areas of high unemployment.  Eight areas\nhave been invited to bid for one of the four or five Employment Zones to be created.  The\n23\n HC 85, July 1997, p 30.\n24\n Ibid\n25\n DSS Press Release 97/099\n26\n New Labour because Britain deserves better, Labour's manifesto for the 1997 General Election, p. 19.\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n16\nfinal number will depend on the nature of the bids received.  The areas that have been invited\nto bid are Birmingham, Doncaster, Liverpool, Plymouth, South Teesside, Glasgow, North\nWest Wales and Wembley.  A total of £33 million has been allocated to the proposals.27\nIt is anticipated that Employment Zones will consist of local partnerships of organisations\nfrom the public, private and voluntary sectors but it is a key criterion of all bids that the\nEmployment Service is one of the partners.  Each bid will be required to include plans for:\n• Learning for Work - training and education projects;\n• Business Enterprise - help with moving from welfare to self-employment;\n• Neighbourhood Match - work which benefits the whole community.\nIn a press release inviting the bids, Andrew Smith, Employment Minister, outlined the\npriorities for successful bids:28\n\"… beyond these three core strands, we want to see innovative pathways into\nsustainable work.  For example an unemployed person might be given help\ngaining a specific qualification or certificate, a grant or loan for equipment or\ntraining in skills that local employers need.  Employment Zones will give\ncommunities the flexibility to devise local solutions which best meet local\nneeds.\"\nThe Employment Zones Prospectus lists the criteria to be met by bids.29  Partnerships should:\n• involve a range of local partners including the private sector;\n• reflect a range of expertise and provision relevant to the locality;\n• demonstrate an understanding of the different client groups and their needs;\n• produce schemes which are innovative and flexible;\n• make use of existing provisions and demonstrate value for money;\n27\n \"Employment zones: new help from welfare-to-work\", DFEE Press Release 276/97, 15 September 1997.\n28\n Ibid.\n29\n Employment Zones Prospectus, Employment Service, September 1997, pp.12-14.\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n17\n• demonstrate facilities to monitor the effectiveness of schemes;\n• have an effective and affordable marketing and communications plan.\nThe prospectus suggests funding for schemes should be based on an average of £2,000 per\nparticipant and of this 50% should be met by existing funding provision.  The result of the\nbidding process should be published at the beginning of December 1997 and projects are\nexpected to commence on 2 February 1998.\nParticipation in successful schemes will be voluntary but will be open to:\n• people over the age of 25 who have been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for\nmore than one year;\n• people with disabilities;\n• people who require help with basic skills;\n• returners to the labour market and lone parents;\n• ex-offenders, ex-regulars and victims of large scale redundancies.\nParticipants will receive an allowance equivalent to their benefit plus £15 per week or a wage\nif they are employed on a scheme.\nE. Policy Responsibility and Implementation\nMinisterial responsibility for implementing the Welfare-to-Work proposals lies with a Cabinet\nCommittee chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The Committee's terms of reference are\n\"to develop policies to get people from welfare to work and to report as necessary to the\nMinisterial Committee on Economic Affairs\".30  The Ministers with specific responsibility for\nWelfare-to-Work are Andrew Smith, Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal\nOpportunities and Alan Howarth, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Employment and\nEqual Opportunities.\n30\n HC Deb 9 June 1997 c 307W\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n18\nThere is also an Advisory Task Force on the New Deal for Young People and the Long-term\nUnemployed chaired by Sir Peter Davis, Chief Executive of Prudential Corporation plc. Its\nterms of reference are:\n\"- to advise the ministerial Welfare to Work sub-committee on key issues of programme\npolicy and design;\n- to market the New Deal (especially to the business and voluntary sector) and stimulate\naction and commitment;\n- to receive and advise on regular progress reports on implementation and to flag up and\nadvise on emerging issues.\"31\nThere are separate task forces for Wales and Scotland.\nThe Employment Service has overall responsibility for delivery of the New Deal for Young\nPeople and will be expected to work locally in partnership with other organisations.  These\nare likely to include local authorities, voluntary organisations, Training and Enterprise\nCouncils or Local Enterprise Councils (TECs/LECs) and private companies.  The newly\nformed partnerships will be expected to plan delivery based on knowledge of the local labour\nmarket.  The New Deal Design document outlines three options for organising delivery:32\n\"• In some areas, the lead delivery partner will be the ES, in others it will\nbe a private company or public agency.  The partnership may choose to\nask the ES to undertake the contracting for the Gateway services and\nthe New Deal options on its behalf;\n• A second arrangement would be for partners to form a consortium with\nthe capacity to take forward the delivery of all or a large part of the\nNew Deal under contract to the ES.  We would expect such consortia\nusually to include key strategic players like the Local Authority, the\nTEC/LEC, careers services and private and voluntary sector\norganisations;\n• A third option would be the emergence of consortia with which the ES\nwould contract to take forward the delivery of specific elements of the\nNew Deal such as the Environment Task Force.\"\n31\n Treasury Press Release, 5 June 1997, Davis to Deliver New Deal\n32\n p.3\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n19\nLocal partnerships have been asked to put forward proposals through the ES district manager\nand where more than one partnership is proposed a regional assessment panel will evaluate\nthe viability of each proposal.  The regional assessment panel will include as a minimum a\nsenior representative from the ES, the Government Office (or Scottish Office or Welsh Office\nas appropriate) and the voluntary sector, a Task Force member and a senior private sector\nrepresentative with regional knowledge.  It is anticipated that the Gateway services will be\nprocured through competitive tendering.  Private sector organisations have been identified to\nlead partnerships in two of the pathfinder areas.  Reed Personnel Services will lead the\npartnership delivering the New Deal in Hackney and City, and Action for Employment Ltd\nwill lead in South Humber.33\nF. Other Measures\nIn his Budget statement, Gordon Brown also announced plans to help long-term sick or\ndisabled people return to employment:34\nIn 1997, no one in our society who wants to do some work should be excluded\nfrom the right to work because of disability or incapacity. So as a final\nelement of our welfare-to-work strategy, we shall bring forward proposals to\nhelp those who are disabled or on incapacity benefit, and who want training or\nwork. To fund that programme and other measures, I have set aside £200\nmillion from the windfall fund.\nA consultation on the Welfare-to-Work proposals to help the long-term sick and disabled was\nlaunched by a seminar in November 1997.  In a press release to announce the event, Baroness\nHollis, Social Security Spokesperson on the House of Lords said:35\nToday we are taking a major step forward and launching our consultation on\nproposals for the programme for action.  This is likely to involve testing a\nrange of schemes designed to help people move into work or remain in work.\nIt may also involve introducing personal advisers to support those who want to\nmove into work.\nThe other measures to be funded by the £200 million over 4 years set aside for \"future\nmeasures\" include £5 million allocated towards the start up costs of the University for\n33\n HC Deb 3 November 1997 c 32W\n34\n HC Deb 2 July 1997 c 310\n35\n Ministers launch Welfare to Work for sick and disabled people, Department of Social Security, press release 10\nNovember 1997\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n20\nIndustry.36  This is intended to improve the quality and availability of learning materials to\nindividuals and small businesses through the use of new technologies.

Most notably in Sweden and Australia, schemes have\nbeen directed at people who have been out of work for at least one year.  Employers are\noffered subsidies to help with the perceived additional costs, such as training, of recruiting\npeople who have been out of the labour market for long periods.  Similarly, wage subsidies\nform an integral part of the Labour Government's New Deal proposals for both 18-24 year\nolds and those unemployed for more than 2 years.  Dennis Snower, Professor of Economics\nat Birkbeck College, and a supporter of a welfare-to-work strategy, succinctly summarised\nthe thinking behind the Government's proposals:37\nThe underlying idea is to let these people transfer part of their unemployment\nbenefits and related entitlements into employment subsidies for those that hire\nthem.  The unemployed become better off when they find jobs at wages well\nabove their unemployment benefits, employers become better off when their\nlabour costs fall, and the Government is no worse off because the money spent\non employment subsidies would have otherwise been spent on benefits.\nThe assumptions that lie behind such a rationale have provided the framework for the debate\non the effectiveness, or otherwise, of wage subsidies as a tool for reducing the numbers of\nlong-term unemployed or the overall levels of aggregate unemployment.\nThe main arguments against the use of wage subsidies can be summarised as the dead-\nweight, displacement and substitution effects:\n• Dead-weight is the term used to describe those who would have returned to\nthe labour market even without the added incentive for an employer of a\nsubsidy.\n• Displacement refers to the situation where an employer will take on an\nunemployed person who attracts a wage subsidy at the expense of somebody\nwho does not.  The argument is that somebody would have been employed\nanyway and the effect of the subsidy has merely been to remove one person\n37\n \"Three diseases that could kill the Welfare-to-work initiative\", The Guardian, 11 August 1997.\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n22\nfrom long-term unemployment and eventually replace him or her with\nsomebody else.\n• An employee may also dismiss an existing member of staff in order to employ\nsomebody who attracts a subsidy thus decreasing their overall labour costs.  It\nis argued that such a substitution effect is more likely because of the\nincreasingly flexible labour market.\nThe combined effect of displacement and substitution effects can lead to high levels of\n\"churning\" of employees as people move in and out of subsidised work.  This is likely to lead\nto an increase in job insecurity amongst both subsidised employees and those who do not\nattract a subsidy and therefore feel their jobs are at risk.  That these factors influence the\neffectiveness of wage subsidies is rarely disputed but the extent of their effect is the subject\nof debate.\nSome commentators point to comparisons with other similar schemes, both in this country\nand abroad, for indications of the likely effect of the wage subsidy elements of the New Deal.\nA report by the National Economic Research Associates (NERA) in 1995 summarised\nevaluations of 17 wage subsidy schemes from across 10 OECD countries.38  Nearly half of the\nevaluations assessed deadweight but a smaller number looked at substitution and displacement.\nThe results suggested that deadweight was substantial, often over 50%.  Most of the schemes\nwhere additionality (jobs that would not have been created without a subsidy) for the target\ngroup was assessed came out with estimates of between 10% and 30%.  The researchers\nconcluded that they \"are ultimately somewhat sceptical about the likely effectiveness (and cost\neffectiveness) of a permanent full-scale wage subsidy programme eg. for all people unemployed\nover 2 years.  This scepticism should not be taken as hostility to or rejection of such schemes.\"39\nThe report was compiled at the time of the British Workstart scheme.  Piloted by the last\nGovernment in selected areas, Workstart offered employers subsidies of £60 a week for 6\nmonths, falling to £30 a week for the following 6 months, to take on people unemployed for\nmore than two years.  Workstart can therefore be seen as a pilot for the New Deal for the\nLong-term Unemployed.  A report by the Institute of Employment Studies on Workstart\nfound that the scheme met its main aim of influencing employers' selection decisions in\nfavour of the very long term unemployed.40  However, just over half this substitution was at\nthe expense of the shorter term unemployed.  It also met its subsidiary aim of creating\nemployment opportunities with 17% of the vacancies covered and some partial job-creating\neffects among a further 27%.\nThe OECD argues that wage subsidies can be effective if carefully targeted and controlled.\nIn its Jobs Strategy, the OECD notes that an evaluation of wage subsidies in Australia,\n38\n National Economic Research Associates, \"OECD Wage Subsidy Evaluations:  Lessons for Workstart\", report by\nJon Stern, Carole Willis, Nathan Francis and Rachel Goodyer, November 1995\n39\n Ibid p.vi\n40\n \nEvaluation of Workstart pilots, Institute of Employment Studies, Report 279, 1994.\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n23\nBelgium, Ireland and the Netherlands produced positive results despite combined dead-\nweight loss and substitution effects amounting to around 90%.41  The report goes on to\nsuggest ways of making subsidies more effective, such as combining them with a training\nelement or restricting them to employers offering permanent employment.  It can also be\nargued that subsidies have long-term effects in addition to creating more jobs.  The long-term\nunemployed are kept in touch with the world of work, improving their motivation and\nrelevant skills and thus enhancing effective labour supply.  The OECD report argues that this\ncan offset the perceived disadvantages of displacement and substitution even if the overall\nfall in unemployment is marginal:42\nFor equity reasons they [subsidies] may also be intended to provide the long-\nterm unemployed with jobs even if this happens at the expense of the short-\nterm unemployed. These positive secondary effects may still hold if the net\nemployment gains of these programmes are very small.\nThis has been described as the \"silver lining\" of the substitution effect.43\nSupporters of the New Deal proposals believe these wider economic effects of job subsidies\nare often ignored.  They also believe that the degree of inflationary pressure from the labour\nmarket is only dependent on the level of short-term unemployment and that the level of long-\nterm unemployment has little effect.  The long-term unemployed are effectively part of a\ndifferent and marginalised source of supply.  Therefore if somebody who is long-term\nunemployed gets a subsidised job at the expense of a short-term unemployed person, short-\nterm unemployment will rise leading to a fall in pressure on wages.  It is argued therefore,\nthat the resultant reduction in wage pressure will enable employment to expand and absorb\nthe newly created short-term unemployed.  If this is accepted, the substitution effect, whilst\nnot to be encouraged, does not of itself justify a rejection of wage subsidies.\nIn a report for the Employment Policy Institute, Professor Richard Layard of the London\nSchool of Economics (LSE), argues that the overall effect of displacement and substitution is\nexaggerated anyway and claims that the argument that subsidies do not influence overall\nemployment levels as a result is fundamentally flawed.44  He maintains that any displacement\neffect is temporary as people who would have been hired will remain attractive to employers\nand will soon be taken on by other employers.  He equates this situation with temporary rises\nin unemployment caused by business failure:45\n41\n The OECD Jobs Strategy: Enhancing the effectiveness of active labour market policies, OECD, 1996.\n42\n Ibid page 11\n43\n \"Brown holds the key to work\", Financial Times, 11 August 1997.\n44\n Preventing long-term unemployment: strategy and costings, Employment Policy Institute Economic Report, Vol\n11 No 4, March 1997.\n45\n Ibid page 3\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n24\nThis is exactly the same process as occurs when a business ceases to hire\npeople.  When hiring ceases there is of course a temporary rise in\nunemployment, but soon those who would have been hired fill other vacancies\nand the labour market adjusts.  There is no permanent rise in unemployment\n(except perhaps in an isolated company town).  Yet all traditional analysis of\nrecruitment subsidies assume a permanent rise in unemployment in the rest of\nthe economy.  These analyses have no scientific foundation.\nHowever, in an article for the Unemployment Unit, David Webster contests that it is exactly\nthese economically \"isolated\" communities that are the problem and that separating the issues\nof long-term and overall unemployment is misleading.46  He argues that there is little\nevidence of a certain type of unemployed person who becomes increasingly unemployable\nthe longer he or she is out of work; the so-called \"withering flower\".  His research shows a\ndirect correlation between the numbers of long-term unemployed and total unemployed when\na time lag of 3 financial quarters (to allow for the time lag between long-term and total\nunemployment) is introduced.  If this correlation is accepted there is little argument for\nsubsidising the long-term unemployed in returning to work as a decrease in overall\nunemployment will eventually see a proportionate decrease in the long-term unemployed.\nThe problem is not therefore a particular type of unemployed person but areas where pockets\nof adult male unemployment are disproportionately high compared with the rest of the\ncountry.  High long-term unemployment has persisted in the areas that lost most jobs and this\nanalysis leads Webster to propose an alternative solution:\nThe key requirement to reduce long-term unemployment and related welfare\npayments is to promote relevant blue collar jobs in the areas of highest\nunemployment, particularly by facilitating investment in manufacturing\nthrough spending on derelict land reclamation, infrastructure and industrial\nproperty.  Of course, such policies are not totally unknown.  But to date they\nhave rarely been pursued with much vigour.  They would have been a worthy\nuse of the windfall tax.\nTo an extent this argument is supported by the Australian experience as researched by the\nUnemployment Unit.47  Although this research accepted the idea that the long-term\nunemployed find it more difficult to obtain work, it concluded that wage subsidies did little to\nhelp the \"significant minority [that] are likely to be locked into occupationally or\ngeographically segmented labour markets, characterised by low paid, temporary and part-\ntime jobs, where there is little chance of them moving into other labour markets.\"48\n46\n Welfare-to-work: why the theories behind the policy don't work, Unemployment Unit Working Brief, June 1997.\n47\n Working Nation: welfare reform and the Australian Job Compact for the long term unemployed, Dan Finn,\nUnemployment Unit, 1997.\n48\n Ibid page 70\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n25\nThe Australian Compact scheme was typical of wage subsidy schemes in other countries in\nthat it was targeted at the long-term unemployed (in this case those unemployed for more\nthan 18 months).  Other countries such as the Netherlands have used a longer period as the\ndefinition for the eligibility for their active labour market policies.  The emphasis in the\nproposals outlined by the British Government is different from most other schemes in that it\nis weighted both in resources and scale towards the young unemployed.  Any young person\nbetween the ages of 18 and 24 who has been in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance for more\nthan 6 months is defined as long-term unemployed for the purposes of the New Deal.  The\nrationale behind this is that young people become more quickly disengaged from the labour\nmarket.  Failure to integrate young people into the job market has longer term consequences\nfor both the individuals concerned and the long term labour supply.  They are also considered\nmore likely to benefit from the training elements of all the New Deal options and thus\nbecome more employable in the future.\nHowever, there are strong arguments for focusing help on the more long-term unemployed.\nSuch an approach is likely to reduce the amount of deadweight because it is targeted towards\nthose people who have already become highly marginalised from the labour market.  Also,\nreducing the numbers of long-term unemployed is likely to cause little inflationary pressure.\nThese arguments have led to criticism of the emphasis in the Government's proposals as\nsummarised by Jon Stern, from the National Economic Research Associates (NERA), in his\nwritten submission to the House of Commons Sub-Committee on Employment:49\nThe probability that someone aged under 25 and unemployed over 6 months in\nApril 1996 would have left unemployment by April 1997 was 82% (or around\n65% over a 6 month period).  The same probability for potentially very high\nlevels of deadweight for the under 25s under the New Deal proposals implies\nthat a recruitment subsidy for them is likely to have significant net Exchequer\ncosts.\nThe case, on employment grounds, for tilting the eligibility criteria towards\nthe young unemployed looks weak - unless it can be demonstrated that the\nbenefits in terms of the amount and/or quality of subsequent employment are\nmuch higher for this group than for the older unemployed.\nSupporters of the general principle of job subsidies have made similar criticism of the\nemphasis of the New Deal job subsidies on young people.  In their submission to the Sub-\nCommittee on Employment, Dennis Snower and J. Michael Orszag, from the Department of\nEconomics at Birkbeck College reiterate the point that \"economic research shows that the\nvast majority of people in this category [18-24 year olds] would find employment with or\n49\n Job Subsidy Schemes, A paper for the House of Commons Sub-Committee on Employment, NERA, August 1997,\np.iv.\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n26\nwithout a subsidy\".  They argue that resources would be better used to make the subsidies for\nthe long-term unemployed more flexible:\nIt is of course important to help a young person into the job market, but it is\nalso natural for young people - who need time to match their skills with jobs -\nto have relatively high unemployment rates.  For the young as for adults their\nunemployment becomes a problem if it lasts long. …As a rule of thumb, the\nlonger a person's duration of unemployment, the less capable that person is\nlikely to become properly integrated in the labour market, and thus the higher\nthe employment subsidies that person is likely to require.  For this reason, it\nwould be wise to deal with the problem of long-term unemployed through\nemployment subsidies that rise with unemployment duration.\nAgain the Australian experience appears to support this as assessments of the Compact\nscheme reported hostility from employers to taking on the long-term unemployed with only\nthe relatively small subsidy offered.\nThe propensity of the young unemployed to find unsubsidised work raises concerns about the\npotential displacement of older long-term jobseekers.  In his evidence to the sub committee\non Employment, John Philpott of the Employment Policy Institute, also argued that the\nGovernment should change its emphasis to this group and warned of \"a tendency to ignore\nthe real distress of an unskilled unemployed over 40 year old.\"\nThe general principle of job subsidies for the unemployed remains contentious but the\nperceived advantages become more apparent if the effect of substitution is seen in a wider\ncontext than the effects on individuals.  The problems of substitution, displacement and\ndeadweight, however, are arguably exacerbated by concentrating resources for subsidies on a\nsection of the unemployed that is likely to be significantly more employable than other\nsections that attract no subsidy at all or must be unemployed for longer before they can attract\na subsidy.  The intensive Gateway period is a clear attempt to reduce deadweight by helping\nyoung people into employment through more cost effective methods, such as improving job\nsearch techniques.  There must be some concern, though, that employers will collude with\nyoung people, and only offer them jobs once they have completed the two months of the\nGateway and obtained their voucher.  The success of this intensive period of counselling in\nweeding out those who would get jobs anyway is therefore likely to impact on the overall\neffectiveness of job subsidies for the young unemployed.  Similarly, the employer agreement\ndescribed in the Design of the New Deal states that employers will not make people\nredundant in order to take on somebody who attracts a subsidy.  They also agree to continue\nto employ people beyond the 6 months of the subsidy where they have proved themselves\ncapable of doing the job.  However, it seems unlikely that this agreement will be enforceable\nby legislation and the goodwill of employers will be essential to the success of the subsidies.\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n27\nB. The Intermediate Labour Market and Voluntary Sector Options\nThe Government is planning to pilot the Intermediate Labour Market (ILM) concept through\nthe new Employment Zones and it seems likely that the experience of these pilots will\ninfluence the development of the Voluntary Sector and Environment Taskforce Options.\nSupporters of such an approach point to work by the Wise Group and Glasgow Works.  The\nIntermediate Labour Market approach consists of a package of training, work experience and\npersonal development and has been particularly targeted at the long-term unemployed.  In its\nsubmission to the Sub Committee on Employment the Wise Group summarised the important\nfeatures of an ILM scheme:\n• Its primary aim is to offer the long-term unemployed and those who are\nfurthest from the labour market a bridge back to the world of work.\n• It combines relevant high quality vocational training with a substantial period\nof work experience and personal development including job search activity.\n• It creates a realistic work environment for the long-term unemployed with all\nof the key characteristics of employment\n-A rate for the job wage\n-A contract with rights and obligations\n-Quality management and supervision\n-The work carried out is to a high quality and of real value\n-Voluntary participation\n-A work reference for future employers\n• It is well managed and has a lifespan beyond the duration of any particular\nfunding regime.\n• It adds to the supply of jobs particularly where there are weak local\neconomies.\nThe Wise Group programmes helped 57% of participants into a full time job or further\neducation last year and their client group is taken from those who have been unemployed for\nover 6 months.  This rate of success compares favourably with other publicly funded job and\ntraining schemes.  However, ILMs are relatively costly with the gross costs per job ranging\nbetween £9,000 and £14,000.50  This has attracted criticism but the Employment Policy\nInstitute argues in its submission to the Sub Committee on Employment that a comparison of\ncosts per job does not allow for other savings:\n50\n Intermediate labour Markets and Job Subsidies, Submission by the Centre for Social Inclusion to the House of\nCommons Education and Employment Committee, September 1997.\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n28\nWhen one accounts for the savings that accrue from the Wise Group's superior\nperformance in helping its participants enter jobs, the Group appears to offer a\ngood value - if not necessarily free - lunch to the taxpayer.  And when one\naccounts for the valuable social outputs and reduced social costs that flow\nfrom the Wise Group's activities the rate of return to the Group's ILM looks\nmore attractive still.\nHowever, the EPI also raises concerns of adverse macroeconomic effects of successful ILM\nschemes, such as raising wage pressure, pointing to evidence from an expansion of jobs\nprogrammes in Sweden in the1980s.\nThe effectiveness of such schemes, and the Voluntary and Environment Task Force options\nin the New Deal for Young People, are likely to be particularly important in areas of high\nstructural unemployment where there may be few employers willing to make use of wage\nsubsidies.  There must be concern that a large number of participants forced into these\noptions in areas where there is little take up of wage subsidies may have the effect of\nreducing the credibility of the New Deal, particularly amongst its participants.  It is argued\nthat such community jobs do little to improve the long-term employability of participants.\nThe EPI highlighted the reasons for this:51\nEvidence seems to suggest that the problem of poor re-employment prospects\narises because the pace of the work on projects run by many voluntary\norganisations is slow and does not adequately equip young people for a return\nto jobs in the regular economy.  This stems in turn from the fact that voluntary\norganisations engaged in such schemes are normally required to undertake\nmarginal activities in order to reduce the possibility of displacing other private\nand public sector enterprises and hence maximise job additionality.  In other\nwords the projects come to resemble 'make work' schemes.\nThe extent to which ILM approaches are used as the New Deal develops remains to be seen\nand this is likely to depend on the take up by employers of the job subsidy scheme and the\ncost effectiveness of alternative options.  The core training elements of each option are an\nattempt to provide participants with worthwhile outcomes in terms of recognised\nqualifications in light of the evidence of the ineffectiveness of a sole reliance on community\nprogramme schemes as a tool to increase employability.\n51\n Op Cit, EPI Submission to Sub-Committee on Employment\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n29\nC. The Compulsion Debate\nThe earliest announcements of a Welfare to Work programme as Labour Party Policy\nstressed that the four options available to young people would not be supplemented by a fifth\noption of remaining on benefit.  Benefit sanctions introduced by the previous Government\nunder the Jobseekers Allowance will be used to reduce the benefit of those who refuse to take\nup one of the options, through an extension of the current regulations.\nAs recently as 1996 there was no such consensus on the need for benefit sanctions.  In its\nreport on the Right to Work/Workfare, the Employment Committee concluded:52\nThough compulsion may not affect the attitude to the work offered for many\npeople, for some it will, and these people will be capable of disrupting the\nopportunities for many others.  If the jobs offered are attractive and interesting\nand valuable enough, compulsion will not, we believe, be necessary.\nThe principle that benefits sanctions should be applied where claimants fail to meet their\n\"responsibilities\" as benefit recipients now appears to have been accepted by all of the major\npolitical parties.  However, the debate continues amongst academics and those groups\ninvolved in implementing labour market policies.\nSome supporters of a compulsory element to Welfare to Work schemes argue that without\nsuch compulsion the programmes would fail to reach those who need them the most.  It can\nbe argued that the long-term unemployed need coercion as they become so dissociated from\nthe labour market that they become unable to respond to rational incentives.  One of the most\ntrenchant advocates of this argument, Lawrence Mead, has heavily influenced American\npolicy in this area.  He argues that incentives assume a degree of competence in the long-term\nunemployed that does not exist and such competence needs to be engendered in somebody\nwho has been out of the labour market for a long time before they can be offered options.\nThis argument assumes that there is work available for the long-term unemployed if they are\nsufficiently motivated and have the skills to take it.  It also assumes that, to a certain extent at\nleast, the unemployed contribute to their own misfortune.  In his evidence to the Employment\nCommittee Report on Workfare, Professor Alan Deacon summarised the arguments against\nsuch an approach:53\nMost British commentators recoil from such uncompromising individualism.\nThe familiar and established objection to such an approach is that it fails to\naddress the fundamental, structural causes of unemployment.  This means that\n52 The Right to Work/Workfare Employment Committee Second Report 1995-6, HC 82, p.xlviii\n53\n Ibid Appendix I, p.3\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n30\nit is bound to be ineffective and to damage still further the morale of the\nunemployed.\nInstead, supporters of Government policy have emphasised the responsibilities of the\nunemployed to respond to the offer of high quality training and employment options, and it is\nthese responsibilities that justify benefit sanctions.  Such responsibilities, it is argued, are\nrequired to obtain the \"right\" to receive benefit in the long-term and help to create a\n\"contract\" between the state and the individual.  In the Budget debate, David Blunkett,\nSecretary of State for Education and Employment reiterated this argument:54\nThere is an issue here of rights and responsibilities, and of obligations.  We\nneed to ensure that people are prepared to take up those responsibilities for\nthemselves, which is important.  The ability to offer choice is at the heart of\nthis programme.  People can choose, and be guided and supported in what is\nright for them.  For the able bodied we do not believe that it is right for them\nto turn down those choices and to continue drawing benefit.\nIt seems likely, however, that sanctions are a pragmatic necessity.  The New Deal proposals\nare relatively costly and this, in part, explains the compulsory element.  It is argued that tax\npayers will expect to see the unemployed work towards self reliance in return for the money\nthat is being spent on them.55\nCritics argue that the coercive nature inherent in such a policy makes it difficult to attract\nsupport from claimants and ultimately masks any realistic analysis of its effectiveness.\nCompulsion would appear to carry the risk that claimants will be forced into jobs or training\nprogrammes for which they are unsuitable and consequently unmotivated.  Dennis Snower\nargues that there may be a need for an element of compulsion in countries where\nunemployment benefits exceed 70% of the average wage.  In Britain, benefits are far less\ngenerous and therefore claimants find it less easy to sustain self-esteem when out of work and\nare less likely to see life on benefits as a soft option.  He concludes:56\nWhile it is important to make it difficult for benefit claimants to work in the\nblack economy, labour compulsion runs the danger of forcing people into jobs\nat which they are unsuitable, unproductive and unmotivated.  The only way to\ntell whether the Government's employment and training programmes are\nattractive is to give people the option of refusing them and then to see what\nhappens.\n54\n HC Deb 3 July 1997 c 442.\n55\n \"Tough love or rough treatment\", Economic Report, Employment Policy Institute, July 1997.\n56\n Evidence to the Employment Sub-Committee: The New Deal, J Michael Orszag and Dennis J Snower, Birkbeck\nCollege, p. 6\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n31\nSimilarly, all the New Deal Options have a training element and it must be questionable\nwhether compulsory training is likely to be effective.  Participants who resent having to\nattend courses are unlikely to behave in a way conducive to a positive learning environment.\nConcern over compulsion is likely to be greatest in areas of high structural employment\nwhere the employer option may be less available to claimants than in other areas.  This would\nresult in people being obliged to take up options such as the Environment Task Force or the\nVoluntary Sector option.  It seems probable that such a situation would lead to high levels of\nparticipant dissatisfaction as has been reported in other Government programmes such as the\nYouth Training Scheme.  This was criticised by participants for failing to lead to any\nimprovement in long-term job prospects for the reasons highlighted above.\nD. Lone Parents - Progress Report\nThe New Deal for Lone Parents has commenced in 8 pilot areas and so is the only part of the\nNew Deal proposals for which there has been any evaluation.  Some early results of the New\nDeal for Lone Parents were published on 23 October 1997.57  This showed 8,651 invitations\nto interview had been issued; 2,026 interviews had been held; 1,612 lone parents had agreed\nto participate; and 433 had obtained jobs.  On average, lone parents in work were found to be\n£50 per week better off than on income support though these figures do not take into account\nin work costs described by the DfEE as \"relatively small\".58  Iain Duncan Smith, Opposition\nSpokesperson on Social Security, has criticised Harriet Harman, Secretary of State for Social\nSecurity, for launching the scheme prematurely and argued that many of the lone parents\nwould have found work anyway.  He contested they tended to be separated or divorced\nwomen with work experience.59  This appears to confirm that any evaluation of the New Deal\nproposals will be open to criticism if it does not attempt to quantify the deadweight and\nsubstitution effects.\nThe implementation of the New Deal for Lone Parents has been welcomed by a number of\norganisations representing single mothers.  However, critics argue that changes to the benefit\nsystem that have been introduced by the Government have either done little to help lone\nparents return to work or have actively worked against the policy objectives.  The Social\nSecurity (Lone Parents) (Amendment) Regulations 1997 were originally proposed by the\nprevious Government and withdraw the lone parent premium for Income Support, Housing\nBenefit and Council Tax Benefit from April 1998.  As Housing Benefit and Council Tax\nBenefit are paid to those in work as well as those on Income Support, it is argued this\n57\n DSS, A New Deal for Lone Parents: Moving forward.  Progress report on the first three months, October 1997\n58\n Ibid p.3\n59\n \nGuardian, 24 October 1997, “Success rate of welfare to work defended”\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n32\nexacerbates the benefit trap for lone parents.  In a briefing for the debate in the House of\nLords on the Regulations, the National Council for One Parent Families concludes:60\nWithout going into the detailed arguments about whether or not lone parents\nface extra costs compared to two-parent families it is clear that pushing lone\nparents on income support into increased poverty undermines their ability to\ncope and therefore undermines their ability to obtain employment.\nIn his Budget Statement, Gordon Brown announced an extension of the childcare disregard\nfor Family Credit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit.  The current threshold of £60 is\nto be raised to £100 from next Summer for families with more than two children.  In a written\nanswer published after the House had risen for the Summer recess the Government confirmed\nthat the number of lone parents in receipt of Family Credit who would benefit from the\nincrease in the disregard was only 2,000.61  The small scope of the concession was heavily\ncriticised by Steven Webb MP:62\nThis is equivalent to just three people per parliamentary constituency.  The\nGovernment has made much of its national childcare strategy but in fact the\nscale of the programme is very modest with childcare disregard being a drop\nin the option.  Extra money will come from the lottery and the Windfall tax\nbut even this will be outweighed by the money the Government is taking off\nlone parents through benefit cuts.\nCritics also point out that in concentrating resources on advice and job search assistance the\nNew Deal for Lone Parents does little to help with the financial costs incurred by lone parents\nwho give up benefits to return to work.  Lone parents are the section of benefit claimants who\nare most likely to be in receipt of means tested benefits.  Over 80% receive at least one means\ntested benefit.63  They are therefore particularly susceptible to punitive benefit tapers at the\nmargins (ie. the rate at which benefit is withdrawn as earnings rise).  The problems faced by\nlone parents are summarised in an article for Adviser magazine:64\nThe acid test of any scheme devised to enhance employment opportunities is\nhow far (if at all) a person would be better off in full-time work than either out\nof work or in part-time work and how those who have childcare costs compare\nwith those who have none.  Because MTB (means tested benefit) rates have\n60\n Social Security (Lone Parents) (Amendment) Regulations 1997, Briefing by the National Council for One Parent\nFamilies, page 3.\n61\n HC Deb 29 July 1997 c 255-6W\n62\n \"Brown childcare boost 'helps just 2,000 people'\", Guardian, 16 August 1997.\n63\n HC Deb 10 December 1996 c113\n64\n \nAdviser, Number 63, September + October 1997, p. 12\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/118\n33\nalways been set so low and tapers set so high, however, the notorious\nshortcomings of the means test are merely exacerbated where a claimant needs\nto pay for childcare.\nPossible future measures to address these problems include adjusting tapers or introducing\nsome form of earned income tax credit system.

Introduction and Summary\nNon-discretionary additional benefit payments during exceptionally cold weather for recipients\nof income support (and previously supplementary benefit) have been part of the social\nsecurity system for the last 10 years. During this period the system has undergone a number\nof developments and now payments of £8.50 are automatically made to certain recipients of\nincome support during periods of “cold weather”. This is currently defined as a period during\nwhich the average recorded or forecast temperature is 0°C or less during seven consecutive\ndays.1\nThe Cold Weather Payments (Wind Chill Factor) Bill seeks to clarify the way temperature\nis measured for the purposes of calculating entitlement to Social Fund cold weather payments.\nIt proposes that wind chill should be taken into account when assessing temperatures.\nCurrently air temperature alone is used. Wind chill attempts to quantify the effective\ntemperature of wind and air temperature together.\nB.  The Bill s Provisions\nThe Bill, reproduced in Appendix 1, has two clauses.\nClause 1 would amend the current regulations governing cold weather payments.2 It provides\nthat temperatures should be measured taking account of wind chill. The current system of\npayments (detailed in the next section) allows payments to be made on the basis of recorded\nor forecast periods of cold weather and this clause inserts consideration of wind chill in the\ncalculation of recorded and forecast spells.\nThe Bill does not define how wind chill will be incorporated into the formula for working out\ncold weather payments. The proponents of the Bill state this will be the subject of guidance\nissued once the Bill is passed.\nClause 2 details the formal citation for the Act should the Bill be passed.\n                                                  \n1\n  Social Fund Cold Weather Payments (General) Regulations 1988 SI 1988/1724 (as amended)\n2\n ibid\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/3\nC. The Current System of Cold Weather Payments\nPayments are made automatically from the Social Fund to certain recipients of income support\nduring a period of cold weather. This is defined as seven consecutive days in which the\naverage mean daily temperature is 0°C or less. Payments can be \"triggered\" by actual\ntemperatures recorded during the past week falling below this threshold or if temperatures are\nforecast to do so by the Meterological Office for the day of the forecast and the following 6\ndays. \nTemperatures are monitored by the Meteorological Office on behalf of the Benefits Agency\non a daily basis at a series of weather stations. These cover the whole country, with each\nstation being designated a number of postcode areas. Benefit claimants' home addresses and\nassociated postcodes are used to determine whether the area in which they live has triggered\na cold weather payment.\nA person is eligible for a cold weather payment if they are entitled to income support or\nincome-related jobseekers allowance for at least one day in the period of cold weather and\nif they come into any of the following categories:\n  with dependent child aged under 5\n  in receipt of one of the following premiums:\n• pensioner\n• higher pensioner or enhanced pensioner\n• disability\n• severe disability\n• disabled child\nPayments are paid at a fixed amount for each week of cold weather. This is currently £8.50.\nIn November 1995 there were 3.3 million income support claimants in Great Britain in one\nof these categories.3 \n                                                  \n3 Income Support Statistics Quarterly Enquiry\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/3\nD. Meteorology\nThere are currently 70 weather stations throughout Great Britain used to monitor daily\ntemperatures for the system of cold weather payments. Each covers an area defined in terms\nof postcodes and these are used to assign claimants to a particular weather station.\nThe average weekly temperature at each weather station, and any forecast period of cold\nweather, is provided by the Meteorological Office to the DSS on a daily basis throughout the\nWinter.\nThere are some fairly complicated rules about payments where there are overlapping periods\nof cold weather. Basically the rule is that if a day has been used once in a calculated period\nof cold weather it cannot be used again. Thus, if there is a week of cold weather recorded\nending today a second payment would not be awarded until a further complete week had\npassed, even if the intervening days had triggered. If a payment has been triggered on the\nbasis of a forecast then a further one cannot be made on the basis of recorded temperature\nusing any of the days contained in the forecast.\nE. Payments and Expenditure\nThe following table shows how spending has varied over the last 6 years, largely depending\non the severity of the Winter but also the number of eligible claimants and rate of payment:\nSocial Fund cold weather payments - 1991/2 to 1995/6\nYear Number\n000s\n£000s\n1990/1 1,700 8,600\n1991/2 3,800 23,000\n1992/3 2,500 15,000\n1993/4 2,100 12,400\n1994/5 11 77\n1995/6 7,200 62,000\nHC Deb 22 April 1996 c32w, DSS Press Notice 14 Oct 96\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/3\nF. Development of the Current System\nThe system of cold weather payments has it origin in December 1986 when the previous\nsystem of payments based on local office discretion was replaced. The scheme was broadly\nthe same as the current one except:\n• it used a fixed Monday to Sunday qualifying period;\n• it used a 'trigger' temperature of -1.5o C;\n• a claim had to be made for each cold weather period.\nThe groups qualifying were householders on supplementary benefit who were over 65 years\nof age, had children under 2 years or were sick/disabled. Payments were subject to a capital\nrule of £500.\nIn January 1987, during a period of very cold weather, Margaret Thatcher announced that\npayments would be made to all eligible people, regardless of whether or not their area had\n'triggered'.\nAlso, during 1987 the 'trigger' temperature was raised from -1.5oC to 0oC.\nIn October 1988, the £5 per week cold weather payment scheme was incorporated into the\nnew Social Fund. The following changes were also made:\n• the qualifying period was changed to any seven consecutive days of cold\nweather (averaging 0oC or less);\n• anybody over 60 years of age became eligible because of the link to the\nincome support pensioner premium;\n• help was extended to claimants with children under 5 years of age\nIn 1990 the capital limit was raised from £500 to £1,000 for people over 60 years.\nIn 1991, again during a period of sustained cold weather, John Major announced that as an\nexception, payments would be made to all eligible people regardless of their area.\nThe payment was also increased from £5 to £6.\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/3\nIn November 1991, a number of other improvements to the system were made:\n• payments became automatic, there was no longer a need to made a claim;\n• the capital rule was abolished;\n• forecast periods were introduced.\nFrom November 1994, payments were increased from £6 to £7 as part of the compensation\npackage to take account of the introduction of VAT on domestic fuel.\nIn November 1995, the rate of payment was increased from £7 to £8.50. (It remained\nunchanged in 1996).\nIn November 1996, there were major changes made to the number of weather stations and\ntheir coverage.\nSince the introduction of the scheme, various changes to the postcode areas and linked\nweather stations have been made.\nG. Changes for Winter 1996/7\nFollowing last Winter's experience when the severe weather meant a record number of\npayments being made, the DSS undertook a comprehensive review of the scheme4. This\nfollowed criticism from both the media and MPs during Winter 1995/6. Regulations came\ninto force on 4 November 1996 which revised the system in the light of this review5.\nThe DSS' review was particularly concerned with the links between postcodes and weather\nstations, as during Winter 1995/6 a number of anomalies had been highlighted under the\n                                                  \n4 Met Office Recommendations by the Met Office for the Summer 1996 Review of the Cold Weather Payments\n  Scheme prepared for the DSS, August 1996\n5 The Social Fund Cold Weather Payments (General) Amendment Regulations 1996 SI 1996/2544\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/3\nsystem. Complaints often arose because the areas covered by the 55 weather stations split\nsome urban areas. This could result in people in one part of a town or city getting payments\nand in another part not getting them. In 1995/6 this was illustrated by experience in London,\nwhere some areas were covered by the Stansted (Essex) weather station and others by a\nstation at Heathrow. When one of these \"triggered\" but the other did not it resulted in some\nLondoners feeling unfairly treated compared to others. Also some weather station links\nseemed inappropriate and a number of representations from individual MPs along these lines\nwere investigated during the review.\nIn addition, the DSS asked the Met Office to consider the potential for incorporating an\nallowance for the effects of wind-chill into the scheme.\nWith the exception of wind chill, the results of the review have largely been incorporated into\nthe cold weather payments scheme. From 4 November 1996, when the Regulations came into\nforce, the number of weather stations was increased to 70. This should improve the\nsensitivity of the scheme. The new areas are as shown in Appendix 2. Schedule 1 to the\nRegulations shows the full list of post-code to weather station links. As well as providing\nnew weather stations, largely to take more account of local climatic variation - for example\nin Devon, Cornwall and Wales where inland (hilly and moorland) temperatures can be very\ndifferent from those on the coast or where the relevant weather station was sited - the new\nweather station coverage also attempts not to split urban areas in the way the old system had\ndone. Thus most of Greater London, for example, is now covered by one station - Heathrow.\nBecause of Met Office automation, not all the weather stations will necessarily be operational\nto the required level throughout the Winter. The Regulations therefore specify alternative\nstations to be used if data from the preferred station is not available.\nIt was not considered feasible to allow for the effects of wind chill in the scheme. The Met\nOffice report concludes, \"For much of the country the additional domestic heating\nrequirements generated as a result of the effects of exposure of houses to wind are too small\nand too highly variable for there to be much merit in trying to allow for them within a\nScheme essentially orientated around payments in respect of cold weather lasting up to a\nweek.\"6\n                                                  \n6  Met Office op cit Para 11.5\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/3\nThe Regulations also included income-related jobseekers allowance in the qualifying benefits.\nThis replaced income support for the unemployed from October 1996.\nH. Views of the Bill's Supporters\nThe Bill has all-party sponsorship and is supported by Age Concern. An Early Day Motion,\nnumber 235 of 1996/7, has been tabled by Audrey Wise which draws attention to her Bill and\ncalls for a wider review of the cold weather payments system. To date it has 130 signatories.\nThe Bill's supporters point to the inadequacies, as they see them, of the present cold weather\npayments system:\n geographical anomalies in the linking of postcodes to weather stations;\n variations in the number of payments made from one station area to another, sometimes\ninvolving people on opposite sides of the same road receiving different numbers of\npayments;\n no account being taken of the effect of wind in combination with temperature;\n no account being taken of individual household circumstances, such as the nature of\nhousing, insulation or type of heating;\n no payments for those who do not take-up income support.\nAge Concern states it favours an extra payment to income related benefits during Winter\nmonths to replace the current cold weather payment system. It also believes there is a need\nfor a programme to improve the energy efficiency of homes so that such payments would\nresult in increased comfort rather than higher fuel consumption. However, it is unlikely that\nsuch a programme could be advocated successfully via a private member's bill and more\nlimited adjustments to the current cold weather payments system are therefore proposed.7 In\noutlining her Bill, Audrey Wise echoes this line, asking Members who prefer a more universal\nsystem for their support on a “half a loaf” principle.8\n                                                  \n7\n Age Concern Briefing Cold Weather Payments and Wind Chill Factor Ref: 3096\n8\n The House Magazine 2 Dec 96 “Cold Weather Payments (Wind Chill Factor) Bill”\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/3\nI. Government Views\nThe Government accepted the recommendations of the 1996 Met Office review of the cold\nweather payments system9. This pointed out that the formula for calculating wind chill used\nin television weather forecasts is based on how cold the wind would make an individual feel\nwhen exposed to it outside. Although houses would also suffer a similar chilling effect they\nare likely to be different from those felt by people. Results of research show that the rate of\nheat loss is critically dependent on wind direction and the siting of a building and the effects\nof the same temperature and wind combination could vary considerably even between\nproperties in the same vicinity. The Met Office points out that if it were found possible to\ninclude wind chill in the cold weather payments system, it would be necessary to reduce the\ntrigger threshold below its present 0°C if the number of payments were to remain the same\nas they would be under the current system. It suggested a trial could be carried out if the\nDSS wanted to pursue consideration of wind chill to replace or complement the existing\nscheme. In the debate on the 1996 Regulations in standing committee Roger Evans said they\nwere sympathetic to trials and investigations and \"we are considering whether the Met Office\nmodel of assessing wind chill could be adapted for use in the scheme.\"10\nMore recently Andrew Mitchell, a junior social security minister, was reported as saying a\nstudy to assess the impact of wind chill on home heating was being considered.11\n                                                  \n9 Roger Evans to the Sixth Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation 18.12.96 c5\n10 ibid\n11\n “Minister may review cold bonus” The Guardian 3 Jan 1997 \n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/3\nAppendix 1\nText of Cold Weather Payments (Wind Chill Factor) Bill \nA Bill to provide that wind chill factor is taken into account in the calculation of cold weather\npayments.\n1.

          "Unemployment by Constituency\nDecember 1996\nResearch Paper 97/7\n15 January 1997\nOfficial monthly unemployment rates for parliamentary constituencies only exist for those few\nconstituencies which are self-contained labour markets. This paper presents up-to-date\nresidence-based unemployment rates not published elsewhere for all 651 constituencies in the\nUK, using figures for the number of unemployed claimants from the monthly count and data\nfor the economically active population from the 1991 Census of Population. \nIn May 1996 the Office for National Statistics moved to a 1991 ward base for the\nunemployment statistics. This means that for many constituencies it is no longer possible to\nmake direct comparisons with previously published data. As a result, this Paper no longer\nincludes a table on changes in the level of unemployment in recent years. Research Paper\n96/63 provides a guide to the methodology and to which constituencies are affected by the\nchange in the geographical base.\nJane Dyson\nEconomic Policy Alison Penman\n& Statistics Section Statistics Resource Unit\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n                                                                   \nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not published elsewhere. These use figures for the number of unemployed\nclaimants from the monthly count and figures for the number of people economically active\nderived from the 1991 Census of Population. \nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour, as they take no account of people's ability to seek work outside the constituency\nin which they live. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nthe Research Paper 96/63.\nThe data contained in this Paper are generally not comparable with figures published in this\nseries of Papers of this series prior to May 1996. This is because in May 1996 the ONS\nchanged the geographical basis of the monthly claimant count. Previously, the monthly\nfigures have related to parliamentary constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1981 wards.\nFrom the April 1996 figures onwards, data are based on constituencies defined in terms of\nfrozen 1991 wards. Whilst figures for January, February and March 1996 were re-released\non the new basis, back-runs of figures for dates prior to 1996 will not be published. For\nmany constituencies therefore, there will be a discontinuity in the figures at the end of 1995.\nFor this reason it is no longer possible to produce tables showing the change in the number\nof claimants 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ago. \nNotes to tables:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The\nfollowing abbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\nVAC Vacant seat\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/7\n2. The data from the 1991 Census of Population used for the denominators in calculating\nresidence-based unemployment rates were obtained from the dataset known as the\nLocal Base Statistics. In the case of the Censuses for England and Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland, the raw data relate to areas known as \"Enumeration Districts\".\nThese data are first aggregated into electoral wards and then wards are aggregated to\nform constituency totals. In Scotland the raw data relate to \"Output Areas\". These\nfigures are not available at a ward level but are aggregated directly into higher level\ngeographical areas such as constituencies and districts.\nThere is inevitably a time-lag between changes in electoral ward boundaries being\nincorporated into parliamentary constituencies. This means that wards are not always\ncoterminous with constituencies. Where this is the case, wards have been best-fitted\nto constituencies on the basis of the constituency where the majority of the population\nare thought to live. Those constituencies where such a process has been employed are\ndenoted \"***\" in all the tables in this paper.\n3.

          "Genetically Modified Food\nResearch Paper 97/8\n20th January 1997\nGenetically modified food is highly controversial, as has been shown by recent examples of\ngenetically modified soya beans and maize. Supporters see it as a way of using scientific\nadvances to develop new foods that could be cheaper than existing one, while offering the\npossibility of reduced pesticide use. Opponents see genetically modified food as potentially\nharmful. If it is not banned, they would at least like it labelled so that consumers can avoid\nit if they choose.\nChristopher Barclay\nScience and Environment Section\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

What scientists can do\nGenetically modified (GM) food is a product of the biotechnology industry which has\ndeveloped after the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 by Crick and Watson.\nAlthough it took some decades for the possibilities to develop into commercial techniques,\nsince the 1970s many new applications have appeared.1\nFood has been the product of science for millennia. Processes such as winemaking, brewing\nor the preserving of foods have involved chemical changes and could be considered food\ntechnology. Selective breeding of animals has been undertaken for centuries - particularly\nfor horses and hunting dogs - and systematic selective breeding of farm animals to develop\nbetter stock has been operating in the UK for about two hundred years. Modern food, of\ncourse, is partly the result of the application of modern science. Crops are grown with the\nhelp of fertilisers and pesticides. Additives are used to help preserve the food and to control\nits taste. Otherwise it would simply not be possible to obtain such a wide range of foods, of\nuniformly good quality, on the supermarket shelves.\nThe techniques of biotechnology go well beyond that. It is becoming increasingly possible\nto identify, within an organism, exactly which gene confers each particular quality and to\neither alter that gene, or even transfer that gene to an organism of a different type. Of course,\nthe complexity of life is such that a particular quality is very rarely determined by a single\ngene, but there are cases where the transfer or alteration of a single gene can change\nparticular qualities, either in a plant or occasionally in an animal. \nThe term \"genetic modification\" when applied to food refers to any artificial alteration in the\ngenetic makeup of a food, animal or plant, or to the use of genetic engineering techniques in\nthe production and manufacturing of food. It therefore covers a whole range of techniques. \nSome changes may be quite subtle. For instance, an animal may be dosed with a hormone\nwhich is essentially identical to one that is produced naturally, but which has been\nmanufactured artificially in large amounts in the laboratory using genetic engineering\ntechniques. This is only altering that animal's physiology, not its genes. However, the food\nfrom that animal (its meat or milk for instance) has been genetically modified. Bovine\n                                                                                                                                                 \n1 The general issues, and the legislation relating to the release of GM organisms are discussed in more\ndetail in an earlier Library Paper : Genetically Modified Organisms, Transgenic Animals and Animal\nPatenting, Library Research Paper 93/55\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nSomatotropin would be an example of this type. \nAlternatively, the genetic makeup of an animal or plant may be changed. A gene can be\nremoved and isolated, amplified or copied many times over, altered, and finally reinserted\ninto animals or plants. Various techniques for achieving this have been developed. To give\njust a few examples here, molecules called \"restriction enzymes\" can be used to precisely\nchop up DNA and isolate the stretch of DNA or gene of interest. A technique known as the\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) might then be used. PCR has revolutionised genetic\nengineering. Typically, the amount of DNA isolated from an organism (or recovered from\na scene of crime by forensic scientists, or extracted from an insect fossilised in amber) is\nminute and thus very difficult to work with. PCR provides a way of amplifying fragments\nof DNA by copying them over and over again millions of times in the test tube. \nThe information contained in the genes, the DNA itself, may be altered through a technique\nsuch as \"site specific mutagenesis\". (Scientists can use agents such as radiation or chemicals\nto change DNA, but these cause random mutations of little use. Site specific mutagenesis\nprovides a means of targeting precise changes at chosen sites.) Finally, the natural properties\nof very simple viruses might be used to deliver modified DNA into a host's cells.\nAlternatively, modified genetic material might simply be injected into an animal's just-\nfertilised eggs under a microscope; changes inserted at such very early stages of embryo\ndevelopment will be present in every cell of the adult animal. \n\"Copy genes\" do not have to be put back into the same type of animal or plant from which\nthey were extracted. They might originate from one organism and be inserted into another\nspecies altogether. Bizarrely enough, this transfer can take place from an animal to a plant,\nso that an animal gene is copied into a plant, or vice versa. Any animal or plant which\ncarries genes from another species is known as a \"transgenic\" organism.2 However, it is\nvery important to note that only copies of the information contained within genes are\ninserted in all cases; the original genes themselves are not transferred.\nImportant applications have already been developed. Plants can be genetically modified to\nconfer resistance against pests or so as to remain edible longer before becoming mouldy.\nSuch genetic modification might reduce the need for pesticides or it might merely benefit the\nretailer. Animals can be genetically modified so as to gain qualities that are advantageous\nto the farmer or consumer. Pigs could be genetically modified so that they go on and on\neating because their body no longer gives the signal that they are full up. Already in 1993\nsalmon that were artificially modified to make them sterile were going on sale in UK\nsupermarkets. A newspaper commented : \"In contrast to the salmon's natural image, the\n                                                                                                                                                 \n2 For further details, see Library Research Paper 93/55, Genetically Modified Organisms, Transgenic\nAnimals and Animal Patenting\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\ngenetically altered variety is deprived of its instinct to migrate upriver from the sea to spawn.\nSuch fish would stay put and grow to twice the normal size of farmed fish\".3 \nPigs can be treated with genetically produced porcine somatotropin (a naturally occurring pig\nhormone) so that their meat is leaner and healthier for human consumers. Similarly, cows\ncan be treated with genetically produced bovine somatotropin (a cow hormone) so that they\nproduce more milk. In such cases, the genetic makeup of the animals themselves has not\nbeen altered but their body physiologies have been altered through the application of genetic\nengineering techniques; genetic engineering has played a part in the food manufacturing\nprocess.\nB. The British system of control\nRegulation has been undertaken at a national level, although this is about to be replaced by\ncontrol at the level of the European Union. The British Government position on GM food\nwas stated in the summer of 1996:4\nMrs Browning : The UK has a well established and internationally respected system for the\napproval of novel foods including genetically modified foods. The safety of novel foods is\nassessed by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes, an independent body of\nexperts set up to advise Agriculture and Health Ministers, and the need for labelling by the\nindependent Food Advisory Committee. The Government support the concept of an EU\nregulation on novel foods and novel food ingredients and are actively participating in\ndiscussions on the details.\nIn the UK, the need for GM food to be labelled is assessed by the Food Advisory Committee\non a case by case basis, as part of the approval process for their use. The Food Advisory\nCommittee is a non-statutory body (comprising a chairman and fourteen members) whose\nmembers are appointed for their personal expertise and not to represent particular interests.\nThe committee advises the Government on the composition, labelling and advertising of food,\nand on additives, contaminants and other substances that are, or may be, present in food or\nused in its preparation.\nThere are several stages of control in the UK. A company wishing to develop a GM food\nmight first need consent from the Health and Safety Executive which can provide \"contained\n                                                                                                                                                 \n3 Sunday Times, 16 September 1993\n4 HC Deb 18 July 1996 c.633W\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nuse consent\" for a strictly contained experiment. The next stage (for a living organism)\nwould be a \"deliberate release consent\" for planting the new crop in a field for research\npurposes. Until now, the involvement of MAFF has been through a voluntary process. The\ngrower would be advised to apply to MAFF for approval for using the GM plant for food.\nThat would be considered by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes\n(ACNFP). After this, a marketing consent from the DOE would be required for a living\norganism. Thus, for example, tomato paste made from the American GM tomato (the flavr\nsavr tomato) could be sold in the UK without such a consent, but the original tomato would\nhave required a DOE marketing consent. The DOE marketing consent applies to the whole\nof the European Union, and can only be given after the DOE applies to the European\nCommission, which consults with the other Member States. The new EU Regulation,\ndescribed in Part IIA, would basically make the MAFF process compulsory requiring a pre-\nmarket safety assessment from the competent authority, which in this context would be the\nACNFP. \nC. The Polkinghorne Report and Government policy\nThe Government set up a committee on the ethical problems involved in GM food, under the\nchairmanship of J. C. Polkinghorne, a distinguished physicist and clergyman. The report\nappeared in October 1993.5 The committee did not cover issues of animal welfare or food\nsafety but examined techniques and discussed whether labelling should be required. Their\nconclusion was a compromise between the strong desire of consumer and religious groups for\nlabelling to allow informed choice, and the reluctance of the industry to accept this. The\nreport argues that \"copy genes\" of animal or human origin do not merit a special ethical\nstatus, and therefore do not need to be identified in food.6 However, the report continues:7\nNevertheless, it is quite clear that our perception is not shared by many of the groups from\nwhom we received evidence. We believe, therefore that the first and most important\nrequirement is for a system of labelling which permits informed choice in relation to the\npresence of ethically sensitive transgenes in food. We believe this implies that labelling\nshould apply to copy genes of human origin, copy genes originating from cattle and pigs\nintroduced into other farm animals, and copy genes of animal origin introduced into plants or\nmicro-organisms. This list should be kept under review and consideration given to its\nextension...\nThis conclusion was accepted by the Food Advisory Committee who were looking into the\nmore general issues of labelling genetically modified food. The Government announced its\n                                                                                                                                                 \n5 Report of the Committee on the Ethics of Genetic Modification and Food Use, HMSO 1993\n6\n\"copy genes\" were defined on p.6\n7 para 5.4\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\ndecision in a reply by Mr Soames:8\nThe Food Advisory Committee takes the view that it would be unrealistic to label every food\nwhose product has involved genetic modification. It has however accepted that there should\nbe provision for choice in relation to those foods which raise real concerns for a significant\nproportion of the population. It has therefore proposed that a GM food should be labelled if\nit:\n(a) contains a copy gene originally derived from a human;\n(b) contains a copy gene originally derived from an animal which is\nthe subject of religious or dietary restrictions; or\n(c) is a plant or microbial material and containing a copy gene\noriginally derived from an animal.\nThese rules would not apply if the inserted copy gene had been destroyed by processing and\nwas not, therefore, present in the food. I am grateful to the committee for its careful and\nthorough handling of the issues. It is continuing its work, in particular in the form of labelling\nthat might be used. Meanwhile, its advice coincides very closely with that of the Polkinghorne\ncommittee and I propose to accept it. The Government will therefore seek provisions on these\nlines in the proposed novel foods regulation which is currently under discussion in Brussels.\nSince very few GM foods have yet come on the market and public understanding of the\ntechnique is still limited, we shall also seek a provision for a review in a few years' time.\nThe Food Advisory Committee considered the matter a little further:9\n11. The Committee then went on to consider the appropriate forms of labelling which might\nbe required to indicate the presence of copy genes in a foodstuff. The Committee felt strongly\nthat, if the criteria for labelling were met, the requirement for a labelling declaration should\nbe a statutory one. It did not consider that labelling could be satisfactorily achieved by other\nmeans, such as non-statutory guidelines.\n12. Based on the evidence which the consultation exercise produced, the Committee\nconsidered that the primary concern of consumers was to be able to identify when a copy gene\nlikely to be a cause of concern to a significant proportion of the population was present in a\nfoodstuff. This was reflected in the criteria which it recommended should trigger a labelling\ndeclaration. As far as the form of labelling was concerned, it concluded that what was\nrequired was a simple declaration - \"contains copies of x genes\" (where x is human, pig etc).\nFor single-ingredient foods and foods sold loose, it considered that the declaration should form\npart of, or accompany, the name under which the food was offered for sale. For prepacked\nfoods with ingredients that contained copy genes, it recommended that the statement should\nbe required to accompany the name of the ingredient in the list of ingredients. However, the\nCommittee considered that if the copy gene was present in an ingredient which under current\n                                                                                                                                                 \n8 HC Deb 4 November 1993 cc313-314W\n9 Food Advisory Committee Annual Report 1993\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nrules did not need to be listed, the declaration about its presence should nevertheless be made,\neither in the ingredients list or next to the name of the food. \n \nThe Food Advisory Committee decides about the labelling requirements on a case by case\nbasis, according to these criteria.\nD.  The Banner Report on animal breeding\nConcerns about genetic modification go well beyond food safety and labelling, so the\nGovernment set up another committee, again chaired by an academic clergyman, (this time\nProfessor Banner) to look into ethical implications of the use of GM techniques in animal\nbreeding.10 The first two recommendations were general :\nGeneral Principles\n(1) that the following principles be accepted as a framework within which present and future\nuses of animals should be assessed.\n(a) Harms of a certain degree and kind ought under no circumstances to be inflicted\non an animal.\n(b) Any harm to an animal, even if not absolutely impermissible, nonetheless requires\njustification and must be outweighed by the good which is realistically sought in so\ntreating it.\n(c) Any harm which is justified by the second principle ought, however, to be\nminimized as far as is reasonably possible.\nIntrinsic Objections\n(2) That an advisory standing committee be created, whose remit should include a\nresponsibility for broad ethical questions relating to current and future developments in the use\nof animals.\nThere are nine recommendations relating to animal welfare, but these are more detailed.\nThere are two on patenting - that developments should be monitored in relation to the threat\nto small producers posed by widely drawn patent protection and that the draft EU Directive\non the legal protection of biotechnological inventions should be supported as it relates to\nanimals. There follow two recommendations relating to the environment.\n                                                                                                                                                 \n10 Report of the Committee to Consider the Ethical Implications of Emerging Technologies in the\nBreeding of Farm Animals, (HMSO 1995) (The Banner Report)\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nGenetic modification and environmental risks\n(15) That the government continue to support international understanding, harmonization and\nco-operation on the control of genetically modified organisms.\n(16) That the Advisory Committee on Release into the Environment (ACRE) should continue\nto scrutinize applications for release or marketing of genetically modified organisms on a case-\nby-case basis and impose restrictive conditions until research or experience has provided\nsufficient data on the impact of releases to allow any relaxation of those conditions.\nThe final recommendation related to genetic diversity, stressing the need to consider the\nconservation of farm animal breeds.\nThe Government accepted the general principles of the Report, but felt that the existing\nadvisory bodies (such as the Animal Procedures Committee and the Farm Animal Welfare\nCouncil) could advise on ethical questions.11 Most of the other recommendations were either\naccepted or referred for more detailed consideration by interested bodies such as the Royal\nCollege of Veterinary Surgeons. Those relating to the environment were accepted. \n \n                                                                                                                                                 \n11 MAFF News Release, 28 February 1995\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nII Some Changes Currently Taking Place\nA. The New EU Regulation\nIt is generally agreed that the regulation of GM food should be undertaken at an EU level,\nwhile worldwide regulation would ultimately be desirable. Otherwise any country trying to\nimpose stricter controls than the rest can only do so by adopting restrictions upon imports.\nIndeed, even EU action does not avoid this problem, since the USA is sometimes more\nwilling to authorise GM than Europe, partly because their procedure is carried out by the\nFood and Drugs Administration (FDA) which sees the issues as purely scientific and does not\nget involved in broader questions of public attitudes or economic disadvantages. It remains\nunclear whether in practice the European Union can ban the import of GM produce from the\nUSA without provoking a serious trade dispute, but it is clear that such action could not in\npractice be undertaken by each individual country without seriously disrupting international\ntrade flows.\nThe EU has just agreed on measures covering the use and labelling of GM food, with the\nEuropean Parliament final vote in favour on 16th January 1997, after a lengthy conciliation\nprocedure between the Parliament and the European Council.12 The Regulation now has to\nbe published in the Official Journal and will then come into force after 90 days. The EU\nRegulation will not greatly affect the position in the UK over rules for the approval of\ngenetically modified food, in that the application will be considered by a committee in each\nMember State very much like the ACNFP. This was stressed in the UK Government\nExplanatory Memorandum:13\nUnlike most Member States, the UK already has an established clearance system for novel\nfoods and processes, operated on a voluntary basis since 1989 by the Advisory Committee on\nNovel Foods and Processes. The Government announced in 1990, during the passage of the\nFood Safety Bill, that in view of the range of novel foods being developed and the likely\nincrease in the use of genetic modification in the development of such foods, the ACNFP\nclearance system was to be put on a statutory basis. However, as the Commission indicated\nit was developing this proposal, the introduction of a national measure was held in abeyance. \n                                                                                                                                                 \n12 Amended Proposal for Regulation of the European Parliament and Council on novel foods and novel\nfood ingredients, EC Draft 7983/96\n13 EC Draft 7983/96\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nAn answer to a PQ in 1995 explained the consequences of the proposed measures for\nlabelling:14\nMrs. Browning : The draft EC regulation on novel foods and novel food ingredients currently\nunder discussion in Brussels will introduce compulsory labelling to indicate the presence in\na food, including genetically modified foods, of ethically sensitive material, material which\nmay have health implications for certain sections of the population and the presence within\nthe food of a genetically modified organism, as defined by directive 90/220/EEC, if it has not\nbeen modified solely for agronomic reasons.\nThis latter exemption from the labelling requirement is important. Basically it means that\ncrops that are modified so as to have some different behaviour when growing but to produce\nthe same food at the end need not be labelled. The legal expression of that notion is, of\ncourse, more complex. Crops which are genetically modified, for example, to be drought-\nresistant or resistant to a herbicide would be covered by the exemption. They would not\ncome under this exemption, however, if the actual crop was substantially different from the\nnatural version. Under the rules proposed by the Commission, the GM soyabeans currently\nthe focus of concern - and discussed in section IIC - would not need to be labelled, since they\nwere modified to make them resistant to a herbicide, not to alter the final food.\nB. Bovine Somatotropin\nBovine Somatotropin, known as BST in Europe and Bovine Growth Hormone or BGH in the\nUSA, is a naturally-occurring hormone, which can be synthesised by GM techniques. It can\nbe administered to cows to improve milk yields. Its use has been licensed in the USA by the\nFood and Drugs Administration, which saw it as a scientific issue, and was satisfied by the\nevidence that there was no danger to consumers and no animal welfare problem. Its use has\nbeen banned in Europe until 31st December 1999, except for limited practical tests to obtain\nany additional scientific data that might be taken into account in taking a final decision on\nits authorisation.15 The decision in Europe was taken by Agriculture Ministers and took other\nfactors into account, including the wisdom of increasing dairy output in a sector where there\nis already overproduction, the possible negative reactions of consumers, and the possible\nbenefits to large dairy producers who would have the resources for the new techniques. More\nrecently, concerns have been raised about animal welfare, but it remains unclear whether they\nwill turn out to be soundly based.16\n                                                                                                                                                 \n14 HC Deb 14 July 1995 c.853W\n15 New Scientist, 20 December 1994\n16 The background is discussed in an earlier Library Paper : Bovine Somatotropin, Library Research Paper\n93/101.

Soyabeans\nIn March 1996, the US company Monsanto was given approval to market processed\ngenetically modified soyabean in the EU. The UK part came under the Genetically Modified\nOrganisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992, as amended.17 The journal Agra Europe\nreported:18\nEU member states have given approval for products obtained from genetically modified\nsoyabean to be sold on the EU market...  Round-Up Ready soyabeans, produced by US\nagrochemical company Monsanto, are genetically modified to be resistant to Monasanto's\nherbicide Round-Up. Under the EU's authorisation procedure, national experts from the fifteen\nEU member states were required to send their opinions on the soyabean to the Commission\nby last Friday [15 March 1996]. The product received approval by a qualified majority of\nmember states, with Denmark, Sweden and Austria voting against and Luxembourg abstaining.\nThe decision will enable US farmers to go ahead with planting plans in April and May. The\nUS exports 60% of its total soyabean crop and soyabean producers are expected to plant\naround 1-2% of their total crop with the genetically modified strain...\nThe name \"Round-up ready\" refers to the fact that the beans are engineered to be resistant to\nthe herbicide \"Round-up\" also produced by Monsanto. Therefore farmers can use round-up\nto kill weeds without killing the soyabeans. \nThe issue has caused particular controversy because Monsanto and the American Soyabean\nAssociation have decided not to segregate GM soyabean from the conventional crop.19 This\nmeans that any imported from the US may contain modified soyabean and so it is not\npossible to definsoyabeanitively label food as containing or not containing modified soya.\nGreenpeace described the decision as \"genetic pollution\" and said that the industry \"was using\nthe European consumers as guinea pigs\" whereas the industry claimed there would be\nenvironmental benefits, as the use of herbicide would be reduced by 30-40% .20\nIn the UK food manufacturers and retailers have decided that they could not avoid the use of\nthe GM soya in a wide range of products, and that they cannot label products according to\nwhether they contain GM beans. In Germany, on the other hand, consumer opposition has\nbeen stronger, and the market leaders in food manufacturing, Nestle and Unilever, have\nreacted to this pressure by making a commitment to avoid the use of GM soyabeans. Nestle\n                                                                                                                                                 \n17 HC Deb 18 November 1996 c.448w\n18 Agra Europe 22 March 1996 pp E/3-4\n19\n\"European retailers stand up to US soya producers\" ENDS Report September 1996\n20 ibid\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nDeutschland, with a turnover of 7bnDM uses only 2,000 tonnes of soyabeans in a year, and\nsaid that they could easily obtain that from sources other than the USA.21 This is a business\ndecision and not because the law is stricter in Germany. In Britain, most products containing\nsoya, including bread, margarines, and chocolate will contain a small unlabelled proportion\nwhich comes from genetically engineered beans. The Consumers Association has called on\nthe Government to force producers to label items which could contain the altered soyabeans.22\nA newspaper reported Diane MacRae, of the Consumers Association, as saying :\"I think it's\na scandal that Unilever and Nestle are not prepared to give British consumers the same choice\nthey are giving to their German counterparts.\"23 \nD. Maize\nGM maize, like GM soya, has been approved in the USA and mixed in with the normal crop.\nHowever, unlike soya there were fears that it would come to Europe before being approved\nin its unprocessed form. There was greater concern about the GM maize, partly because of\nthe insertion of the gene for resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin, leading to fears that the\ngene could find its way into the gut bacteria of livestock and people (see p.15). In this case,\nthe company which developed the product inserted the resistance gene in order to be able to\nmeasure the spread of the GM maize, but critics fear that the consequences would be both\nimportant and potentially harmful.24 The GM maize had already been approved in Europe for\nincorporation in processed products (such as corn flakes) but not for sale in unprocessed form.\nHowever, at the last minute, the EU agreed to approve the GM maize, on the advice of its\nscientific committees.25 Although that approval defuses the particular problem of this GM\nmaize, the more general concern remains that Europe may not be in a position to resist the\nimport of a product that secures US approval. \nThe Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr Gummer) was reported on December 5th 1996\nas having expressed concerns on the radio:26\nIt is true that the Americans are trying to force this on to Europe without us making our own\nminds up about it...One of the important reasons for the EU is that we are strong enough to\nsay to the Americans that \"We decide what we want in our food chain and not you.\" \n                                                                                                                                                 \n21 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 14 November 1996\n22 Independent, 12 November 1996\n23 Guardian, 11 December 1996\n24 New Scientist 6 July 1996\n25 Agra Europe, 20 December 1996 E/4\n26 Independent, 5 December 1996\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nAs with soyabeans, the problem is that the American growers have mixed the GM plant with\nthe normal maize, making it virtually impossible to distinguish the two.27 If Europe therefore\nhad decided to ban the import of all US maize there would have been implications for world\ntrade. The USA would almost certainly have complained to the World Trade Organisation\n(WTO). There is a possible defence in Article X of the Gatt (General Agreement on Trade\nand Tariffs) for a ban on imports (very similar to Article 36 of the Treaty of Rome).\nThe relevant part of the Gatt reads as follows:\nArticle X\nSubject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would\nconstitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the\nsame conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this\nAgreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any contracting party\nof measures :\n(a) necessary to protect public morals;\n(b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;\nIt is unclear whether a defence would be accepted on the grounds that a GM plant was a\ndanger to human, animal or plant life or health. If not, the EU would be faced with a choice\nof whether to accept the GM plant, regardless of concerns, or to refuse to comply and to risk\ntrade sanctions approved by the WTO. It is important to note that the WTO disputes\nprocedure is more serious than its predecessor under the Gatt. If a Gatt panel ruled against\na country, that country could veto the conclusion and prevent any action from being taken.\nUnder the WTO system, unanimity of member countries is not required before action so such\nvetos cannot be used.\nSince the EU approved the GM maize, the Austrian Government has announced that it will\nimpose a unilateral ban on its import.28 The Austrian authorities, through the procedure laid\ndown in Article 16 of Directive 79/112/EEC on the labelling of foodstuffs, notified a draft\ndecree concerning the labelling of foodstuffs, including additives produced through genetic\nengineering. The draft requires the words \"produced through genetic engineering\" to be\nplaced on the labelling of any foodstuff which is, or contains, a genetically modified\norganism. The Commission has pointed out that the notified draft runs counter to the\nlabelling provisions laid down in the common position on the proposed EU Regulation, and\nproposed a Council Decision stating \"that it would be preferable if the Austrian authorities\n                                                                                                                                                 \n27 ibid\n28 Nature, 2 January 1997\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nrefrained for the moment from adopting the draft decree\".29 If the Austrians go ahead further\nlegal action is likely because of the need to ban imports of US maize and soyabeans, where\nthere is no labelling. Presumably this will rely upon Article 36 of the Treaty of Rome, but\nit is difficult to see the role of a unilateral ban within a Union which is moving fast to remove\nall internal frontiers.\nThe reason for objections to the GM maize is that it contained a gene, for an enzyme called\nbeta-lactamase which destroys ampicillin, an antibiotic in the penicillin family. Scientists in\nCiba-Geigy, the company which developed it, used the gene to determine whether plants had\nbeen genetically modified or not. The main critic has been Tony Atkinson, of the drugs\ncompany Duramed, an ACNFP member, who fears that beta-lacramase will jump from corn\nto bacteria in an animal's intestine:30\n\"No one has yet looked at the effect of feeding a gene to lots of animals day in and day out\nfor years,\" he says. Ciba argues that up to 10% of human gut bacteria already contain the\nbeta-lacramase gene, and that there are other antibiotics which are not destroyed by the\nenzyme. But Atkinson notes that the gene in the new maize is coupled with a stretch of DNA\nwhich causes cells to make 600 copies of the gene. This will not only make it more likely\nthat a gene will eventually jump from maize to bacteria. It will also mean that once it does\njump, the bacteria might produce the enzyme in large enough quantities to destroy a wide\nrange of beta-lactam antibiotics.\n                                                                                                                                                 \n29 Proposal for a Council Decision requesting the Republic of Austria to refrain from adopting its draft\nOrder on the labelling of foodstuffs produced by genetic engineering, 13021/96\n30 New Scientist, 4 January 1997 p.8\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nIII Some Issues Relating to GM Food\nA. Is there a danger to consumers?\nIn a sense the concerns relating to the health of consumers centre upon fears that the GM\nfood is not, in fact, really equivalent to the natural version, but differs in some important\naspect which could cause problems. An article by a former director of science at Greenpeace\nUK challenged the assumption that a GM food can be equivalent to the natural variant:31\nRegulators say Monsanto's soyabean is safe because it is \"substantially equivalent\" to natural\nsoyabean. Substantial equivalence is an OECD concept used to decide if things are\nsufficiently different to raise concerns over safety or labelling. It compares the chemical\ncomposition of novel foods with their natural counterparts, for example. But the soyabean has\nunquestionably been genetically engineered, contains foreign genes and produces a novel\nprotein. Unexpected food allergies can not be ruled out. This together with the likelihood\nof increased herbicide use and perpetuation of intensive agriculture has led environmentalists\nto a different conclusion. Genetically engineered soyabean is not the same as traditional\nsoyabean. Laboratory tests of \"substantial equivalence\" do not pick up what may prove to be\nthe most critical differences. \nOne example that opponents of GM food often use is that of tryptophan. Tryptophan is an\namino acid which occurs naturally in foods such as milk and cheese where it is harmless, and\nis indeed essential to the diet. However, in the late 1980s genetically engineered tryptophan\nwas added to other products, and also sold in tablet form as a dietary supplement to aid sleep\nand combat premenstrual tension. Hundreds of cases of illness and 22 deaths in the USA\nwere attributed to this supplement which was then banned. The problems stemmed from a\nfew batches of L-Tryptophan made by a single manufacturer, Showa Denko, in Japan.32\nOpponents of GM food claim that the tryptophan episode shows that something which passes\nall the tests and seems completely harmless may, nevertheless, cause serious damage to\nconsumers. A study of the episode describes what happened.33 Almost all of the cases of\neosinophilia-myalgia syndrome were associated with the consumption of tryptophan made by\na single company: \nThis company used a fermentation process involving Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to\n                                                                                                                                                 \n31 New Scientist, 30 November 1996 p.51\n32 New Scientist, 23 November 1991\n33 E.A.Belongia et al., An investigation of the Cause of the Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome Associated\nwith Tryptophan Use, New England Journal of Medicine, 9 August 1990\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nmanufacture tryptophan. Analysis of the manufacturing conditions accorded to the retail lot\nuse demonstrated an association between lots used by case patients and the use of reduced\nquantities of powdered carbon in a purification step...as well as the use of a new strain of B.\namyloliquefaciens...There was a significant correlation between the reduced amount of\npowdered carbon used during manufacturing and the use of the new bacterial strain....\nConclusions. The outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in 1989 resulted from the\ningestion of a chemical constituent that was associated with specific tryptophan-manufacturing\nconditions at one company. The chemical constituent represented by peak E may contribute\nto the pathogenesis of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or it may be a surrogate for another\nchemical that induces the syndrome. \n  \nIt appears that the problem came from specific aspects of the manufacturing process in Showa\nDenko, rather than from the fact of the tryptophan being genetically modified. That probably\nsuggests the need for greater care in checking GM applications rather than banning all GM\nfood. However, critics might suggest that the tryptophan episode illustrates the risk that there\nwill be some aspect of the final product which is different in a way that does not appear in\nthe tests. Therefore they would argue that the process of genetic modification does produce\nrisks to consumers.\nB. Consumer Attitudes \n1. Germany\nGerman hostility towards GM food partly reflects the high German concern over\nenvironmental matters - as reflected for example in their strong reaction to the planned\ndisposal of Brent Spar in the sea. \nA recent study asked German consumers whether they would buy a range of foods, produced\nwith the help of GM techniques.34 All had unfavourable reactions. The least unfavourable\nwas for marmalade, whose glycosyrup was made by means of an enzyme, produced with the\nhelp of a GM microorganism. 38% would buy it and 42% would not buy it. 32% would buy\na potato, made with a bacterium which meant that it absorbed less fat in roasting, but 48%\nwould not. Only 26% would buy eggs from hens which had been fattened by means of a GM\nenzyme, even if the purpose was to cause less damage to the environment, and 52% would\nnot buy them. Only 14% would buy meat from animals which had been genetically modified\nto grow larger and more quickly. 71% would not buy it.\n                                                                                                                                                 \n34 WBA Institut für Marktforschung und Marketingberatung; quoted in Wirtschaftswoche, 28 November\n1996 p.109\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\n2. The UK \nIn 1994 a consensus conference on plant biotechnology was held in the UK. A \"lay\" panel\nwas selected from volunteers from the general public. The panel was briefed on the topics,\nand then developed a few key questions on which the consensus conference paper was based.\nSome of their opinions are inevitably generalities. The panel felt that biotechnology offered\nthe consumer several potential benefits : improved taste, better nutritional values, longer\nkeeping properties, variety and consistency of quality. However, the panel also noted possible\nobjections, including to the use of plant material containing animal genes, and fears about\npossible allergens resulting from added genetic material:35\nAt the more general level, the panel felt that the public could only freely exercise its right to\nchoose if it knows that products concerned have been genetically engineered...From the\nconsumer's perspective, the panel felt that the products currently reaching the market were ore\nthe result of researchers and producers creating a market for their products, rather than the\nmarket expressing a need or desire for them.\nC. Will GM plants mean more or less pesticide use?\nThe obvious view is that plants can be genetically modified so as to be safe from particular\nsorts of pests, so that use of pesticides will decline. Some people doubt that, however, partly\nbecause they see the same multinationals selling pesticides and having the capacity to produce\nGM plants. It could be in the interests of a company to develop a GM plant which was\nprotected from its own brand of pesticide. That pesticide could then be used to kill weeds,\nbut without killing the GM plant. The company could then get its customers to buy both\nitems. Unless they bought the company's GM seeds, they would not be able to use the\ncompany's proprietary pesticide. The result could conceivably, therefore, be an increase in\npesticide use, because farmers could now use pesticides which would otherwise damage their\ncrops. These issues are raised in the case of the soyabeans genetically engineered to be\nresistant to \"Round-up\". Monsanto claims that this will enable farmers to use the convenient\n\"Round-up\" rather than a greater quantity of other pesticides. Critics would claim that\npesticide use might increase instead. \nTo some extent, one's reaction to such possibilities may depend upon one's attitude towards\nthe activities of large international companies. Those who disapprove of them will tend to\nexpect the result of GM food to be increased pesticide use, because that makes profits for the\ncompany. Those who consider such companies to have a broadly positive influence, will tend\nto stress the other possibilities, involving lower pesticide use and higher output.\n                                                                                                                                                 \n35 Plant Biotechnology - A Consensus ? POSTNOTE 56, January 1995\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nD. Will the Third World Benefit?\nThe GM techniques have mainly been developed by Western multinationals, particularly in\nthe USA - with the important exception of China, whose role is discussed below. They will\nbe patented, so that users will have to pay for them. That might exclude farmers in poor\ncountries who would be unable to afford the seed. A further fear is that such a strategy could\nmean that the benefits would go to richer farmers who could buy the whole package. Farmers\nin poor countries would only benefit if they abandoned their traditional seeds. Such a move\nwould be undesirable for them, partly because of cost, partly because of loss of genetic\ndiversity, partly because their own seeds are better developed for local conditions. Once\nfarmers are lured into the world of bought-in seeds from international companies and\naccompanying pesticides, there is no way back. The local varieties become lost, but the\nfarmers cannot re-use their surplus seeds for sowing, since they have to buy new from the\ncompany. Critics therefore see genetic modification as part of the whole process whereby\nThird World farmers get caught in the cash economy, since they need cash to buy their seeds\nand must therefore obtain cash by selling their crops.\nAnother issue is that it may not be profitable for a company to develop, for example, a better\ncrop for sub-Saharan Africa, but instead to develop a luxury crop for the New York market.\nIndeed, genetic techniques might enable crops in developed countries to replace imports from\nthe Third World, for example by providing longer seasons so that there was no longer a gap\nto fill by imports.\nMultinationals may never be able to satisfy their critics. Many people would blame them for\nreplacing Third World imports, but others already blame them for encouraging the spread of\ncash crops in the Third World. Similarly, they can be criticised either for not producing a\ncrop suitable for Third World use, or for encouraging Third World farmers to abandon their\ntraditional crops in favour of new ones. Yet there is potential for helping the Third World,\nand the spread of GM techniques may make it easier for groups other than cash-rich\nmultinationals to undertake the development.\nE. Do we need genetic modification to feed the world?\nThe serious justification for GM food, of course, is the argument that the growing world\npopulation can only be fed by means of a steady growth in agricultural productivity. The\ndebate on GM tends to assume that the motivation is simply to increase the profits of\nmultinational corporations. Although in a sense that is the reason why corporations do things,\nthat approach often excludes the enormous potential benefits of the new processes. For\nexample, if crops could be genetically engineered to be drought resistant, then output could\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nbe greatly increased in dry parts of the world.\nAttitudes towards world food supplies tend to vary between panic and complacency. Previous\npanics have fortunately not been justified by events and there is perhaps a widespread belief\nthat despite enormous population growth, crop yields will continue to increase automatically\nto outstrip the growing demand. In practice, of course, the increase in output has to be\nachieved - whether by the use of more land, the more productive use of land (for example\nirrigation), or scientific research to develop better seeds. The majority view seems to be that\nsupply will continue to grow in line with demand, although a minority view is that the scope\nfor increases in output are by now limited. There is general agreement, however, that a\nconsiderable amount of scientific research and development will be required in order to\nincrease yields.\nA recent report from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre in Mexico has\nset a goal of increasing wheat yields by an average of 2.5% a year. In the 1960s and 1970s,\nthe so-called green revolution boosted yields enormously, but for the past decade they have\nonly been increasing at around 0.5% a year.36 The recent conference of the Consultative\nGroup on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) was optimistic about the scope for\nimprovements and felt that supply increases could satisfy demand. The importance of genetic\nengineering was stressed, as well as the need to tailor the new crops to the needs of poor rural\nfarmers.37\nF. The Importance of China\nChina is important, partly because there might be shortages of food there, and partly because\nthey have already gone ahead with the testing of GM crops, apparently without all the\nregulatory controls undertaken in the West. In January 1993, it was reported that China had\nbegun testing GM tobacco, potatoes and tomatoes on plots covering several square kilometres,\na far larger area than had then been tried in the West. The idea that GM techniques will be\nthe monopoly of large Western companies may not be correct. According to the New\nScientist, \"It doesn't take much more than a couple of clever well-trained people and some\nquite inexpensive equipment to set up a biotechnology laboratory\".38 \n                                                                                                                                                 \n36 New Scientist, 26 October 1996\n37 New Scientist, 9 November 1996\n38 New Scientist, 2 January 1993\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nLester Brown has argued that the food needs of China will soon come to dominate the world\ngrain market.39 There are several reasons why he sees China as unable to increase production\nenough to satisfy its demand. Output may be increased by better varieties of crops, by the\nuse of more fertiliser, by using more land or by the application of more fertiliser. Yet on\neach count Brown sees either no scope for improvement or a likelihood of loss of output.\nThere is some steady progress in developing strains of crop but there has been little dramatic\nimprovement for some time. Fertiliser application in China is already very high and there are\nsigns that its use already exceeds the optimum level. Land availability is a serious problem\nin China where much of the land is unable to be cultivated. Industrialisation places severe\npressure on cropland, through demand for housing, factories and roads.40 Water is a\nconsiderable problem, partly because most of China's water is in the south and most of its\nwheat is grown in the north. \nThe limitations on China's ability to increase supply contrast with the likely increase in\nChinese demand. This partly derives from predicted population increases. Despite a vigorous\npolicy aimed at limiting each household to one child, population is likely to increase by 490\nmillion between 1990 and 2030. Growth is projected to slow down after around 2015, with\nthe population peaking at around 1.66 billion in 2045. In addition, however, as people\nbecome richer, they almost invariably eat more fish and meat. \nA contrary view - and closer to the consensus - comes from Professor Tim Dyson, who is\ncautiously optimistic on the prospects for world population and food supplies up to the year\n2020. He sees no reason to doubt the continuation of yield improvements in cereals:\nThe average annual increment in world cereal yields since the early 1980s has been about\n42kg per hectare per year. This is actually slightly higher than the long-run average increment\nduring 1951-93. There has been no obviously worrying yield \"slowdown\". There is every\nreason to expect that in all world regions average cereal yields will be markedly higher in\n2020 than they are today; and a global average yield of around 4 metric tons in 2020 seems\na perfectly realistic expectation...\nDyson is far more optimistic about the scope for increasing cereals output in China. He\nstresses uncertainty about even the present Chinese position but does not share Brown's\nconcern :41\n                                                                                                                                                 \n39 Lester Brown, Who will feed China ? (1995)\n40\nop. cit., p. 57\n41\nop. cit., p.188\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/8\nThere has actually been very little change in China's area harvested of cereals since the early\n1980s - partly due to increased multiple cropping (especially in south China). The same is\ntrue throughout the region. It is far from clear that China's irrigation capacity is under any\nimmediate threat. Indeed, even some of the basic facts of Chinese agriculture are uncertain.\nFor example, there are indications that the country's true levels of cereal production and food\nstocks could be larger than has hitherto been thought.\nHe estimates that the Far Eastern region will need to achieve an average cereal yield of about\n6 tons by 2020, and considers that feasible, partly because Japanese yields are already nearly\nat that level, partly because Chinese yields, although well below, have been steadily rising\nsince 1951. Dyson feels that most of the advances up to the year 2020 can be made by the\napplication of already existing technology to agriculture.42 It therefore remains unclear how\nimportant will be the role of GM technology in boosting food production over this period.\nHowever, further increases in population will put increasing pressure on world agriculture and\nmake increasing demands on the technology. \nIn June 1996 The Chinese Government announced a major five year programme of support\nfor research projects, with agriculture playing an important role, including proposals to\nincrease crop yields, promote intensive farming, as well as research into pesticides and\nfertilisers.43\nG. Conclusion\nGM techniques offer major potential benefits, although critics remain concerned about safety\nand environmental issues. Many factors, which are mainly non-scientific, will determine\nwhether the potential benefits are achieved. European reluctance to licence the new products\nrisks trade conflicts with the USA, where such issues are seen in more scientific and less\npolitical terms. There can be no doubt that scientific advances will be required if the\nincreasing population of the world is to be fed, although the role of GM techniques in the\nnear future remains uncertain. Countries where increased production is a priority may adopt\ncertain GM techniques while others retain doubts. In principle, however, GM techniques do\noffer the opportunity of considerable benefit, provided that they are not misused. \n                                                                                                                                                 \n42 Speech at the Oxford Farming Conference, 7 January 1997\n43 Nature, 27 June 1996\n24\n\n\nAgriculture & Food\nEnvironmental Issues\n\n\nRecent Research Papers \n96/114 IGC Issues: Progress and the Dublin Draft 10.12.96\n96/115 Stalking, harassment and intimidation and the Protection from 13.12.96\nHarassment Bill\n96/116 Unemployment by Constituency - November 1996 18.12.96\n97/1 Parliamentary Pay and Allowances: The Current Rates 01.01.97\n97/2 Public Entertainments Licences (Drug Misuse) Bill 17 16.01.97\n97/3 Cold Weather Payments (Wind Chill Factor) Bill (Bill 20 1996/7) 13.01.97\n97/4 The Accountability Debate: Next Steps Agencies (Not yet printed)\n97/5 The Accountability Debate - Codes of guidance and Questions\nof Procedure for Ministers (not yet printed)\n97/6 The Accountability Debate: Individual Ministerial Responsibility\n(Not yet printed)\n97/7 Unemployment by Constituency - December 1996 15.01.97\n\n\n\n"

          "Road Traffic Reduction Bill 1996\nResearch Paper 97/9\n22 January 1997\nThe Road Traffic Reduction Bill is a Private Member's Bill introduced by Don Foster on 20\nNovember 1996. The Bill is due to have its Second Reading on 24 January 1997. Its aim\nis to establish targets for the reduction in the levels of road traffic, but it does not, as was\npreviously expected, require the Secretary of State for Transport to set national targets. \nFiona Poole\nBusiness & Transport Section\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff. Authors are available to discuss the contents of these papers with Members\nand their staff but cannot advise members of the general public.\n\n\nSummary\nThe Research Paper describes the provisions of the Private Member's Bill, the Road Traffic\nReduction Bill, introduced by Don Foster in November 1996 and the earlier efforts to\nintroduce similar Bills. The Bill places a duty on local authorities to draw up local traffic\nreduction plans setting targets for reducing or curtailing the growth of different types of traffic\nin their area by the year 2005 and the year 2010, and to set out the measures which are, in\ntheir opinion, necessary to achieve these targets. It specifically mentions some of the\nmeasures which could be included in such a plan, such as traffic calming and\npedestrianisation. The Secretary of State for Transport may set regional targets but he is not\nrequired to set national targets, as he was in the earlier drafts of the Bill. \nSome estimates of future traffic projections are given in Part III. UK car ownership is at\nhistorically high levels, but the Department of Transport consider that economic growth\ncoupled with the experience of other countries with high standards of living, indicate that car\nownership and mileage driven could well go on increasing for many years. This has led to\nincreasing concern about the economic cost of road congestion as well as the environmental\neffects of pollution from car traffic.\n \nThe Bill requires the setting of targets at local level although not at national level. Part IV\nconsiders the Government's view of targets. It is not convinced that national traffic targets\nare practicable and fears there is too great a risk of imposing costs on society which would\nnot be justified by the benefits produced. It does consider that traffic targets can, however,\nbe a useful and sensible tool for dealing with specific situations at local level and for helping\nto focus attention on strategies and measures needed. \nTransport planners have been trying to reduce the impact of the private car in urban areas for\nmany years as a result of concern about air quality and the economic consequences of\ncongestion. Physical policies are already used to discourage the use of the car such as the\nstricter enforcement of parking controls, allowing public transport to have priority by\ninstalling bus lanes and giving bus priority at traffic lights, and the introduction of park and\nride schemes. Road pricing and motorway tolls are also under discussion. Some policy\noptions which are either being tried or have been suggested for curbing traffic congestion in\ncities are considered briefly in Part VI.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\nPage\nI The Road Traffic Reduction Bill 1996/97 5\nII Previous Bills 9\nIII Traffic Figures 12\nIV Effects of Congestion 18\nV The Government's View of Targets 19\nVI Other Policy Options 22\nVII Further Reading 31\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nI The Road Traffic Reduction Bill 1996/97 \nThe Road Traffic Reduction Bill is a Private Member's Bill introduced by Don Foster on 20\nNovember 1996.1 The Bill is due to have its Second Reading on 24 January 1997. Its aim\nis to establish targets for the reduction in the levels of road traffic or the curtailment in its\ngrowth. \nClause 2 places a duty on all county and district councils and the London boroughs to draw\nup local traffic reduction plans setting targets for reducing or curtailing the growth of different\ntypes of traffic in their area by the year 2005 and the year 2010, and to set out the measures\nwhich are in their opinion necessary to achieve these targets. \nThe local plan should include an estimate of the cost of the measures set out in it, an\nassessment of the effect of each of the measures on the reduction in road traffic and an\nassessment of the likely reduction in carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic\ncompounds and PM10 emissions in the atmosphere. There is a duty on the local authorities\nto consult interested parties in the area and to take into account any statutory development\nplan for the area and the transport needs of any rural areas. \nThe Bill does not limit what might appear in a plan, but it does set out certain measures\nwhich could be included, for example the following are specifically mentioned:\n• the encouragement of cycling and walking;\n• the alteration of planning policies so as to reduce the need to travel;\n• the provision of more or better public transport and rail transport; \n• the reduction of the speed of road traffic through traffic calming measures;\n• the creation of pedestrian only or restricted traffic zones in the area;\n• the provision of information and advice to encourage people to use other methods of\ntransport;\n• co-operation with local businesses as regards steps they might wish to take to reduce\ntraffic;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 HC Deb 20.11.96 c. 994\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\n• grants or loans to others for the purpose of securing a reduction or curtailment of\ntraffic.\nIt is specifically stated that a local plan may include measures which the council itself has no\npower to carry out.\nOnce the council has prepared a plan it is published and a copy sent to the Secretary of State.\nA parish, town or community council may also produce a plan if they wish.\nClause 3 sets out the responsibilities of the Secretary of State. Once he has received a plan\nhe should give reasonable priority to the measures proposed in the plan when allocating local\nmoneys to the council and assist where possible with the measures; he should also notify the\ncouncil of when he expects to receive progress reports on the implementation of the measures\nset out; and at least every two years he should present a general progress report to Parliament.\nClause 4 allows the Secretary of State to give guidance to local councils on the preparation\nof their plans. He should also consider, once he has received all the plans, whether there is\na need for guidance on targets for the reduction or curtailment of traffic in any or all regions.\nIf he decides there is such a need, he may issue it on a national or regional basis. He should\nalso publish a report setting out steps he considers desirable to assist or to encourage others\nto assist with measures to achieve any such regional targets.\nThis is the main difference between the Bill as printed and the original intention of its\nsponsors. The original proposal advocated a nationwide goal of stabilising road traffic at its\n1990 level by the year 2000, with subsequent reductions of 5% by 2005 and 10% by 2010.\nIt was removed following discussions between Don Foster and the Minister of State at the\nDepartment of Transport, John Watts, to try to achieve a Bill acceptable to as many as\npossible. \nThe Act would extend to Northern Ireland. It would be introduced by a commencement order\nmade by the Secretary of State after consultation with local authorities.\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nIn a recent article in the House Magazine Mr. Foster described the Bill's provisions as\nfollows:2 \nThat is what the Road Traffic Reduction Bill is about    policies to cut traffic, and\nbenefit communities, industry, and the environment. It is not anti-car: it is anti\nexcess traffic. It is not about compulsion: it is about achieving ends by policy\ninitiatives such as better public transport, better rail freight facilities, planning policies\nthat reduce the need to travel, encouragement of cycling and walking etc.\nThe mechanisms are simple. Local authorities are given a duty to take such steps as\nthey consider appropriate, after public consultation, to reduce, or curtail the growth\nof traffic in the area. There are no targets because all areas are different. My town\nof Bath differs from Westminster which differs from Cumbria. So the measures are\nleft to local discretion.\nNationally there are targets. After the combined effect of all the local measures has\nbeen estimated, the Secretary of State is given a duty to introduce any extra policies\nthat may be required to achieve a reduction of five per cent (based on 1990 levels)\nby 2005 and 10 per cent by 2010. Modest reductions which will make our land qui-\neter, cleaner and healthier; our streets and towns and villages pleasant again; and our\nindustry more efficient.\nMy Bill has all-party support and as the Government now accepts that measures to\nreduce traffic may be needed even to reach its air quality targets, I look forward to\nfruitful discussions with ministers. I hope we can end up with a Bill that every one\nis happy with and which will make a significant contribution to the life of our\ncountry.\nIn explaining why he was promoting the Bill, Mr. Foster said:\nI am promoting the Road Traffic Reduction Bill for many reasons, including:\n• Health: one in seven children suffers from asthma, a condition exacerbated\nby pollution from car exhausts.\n• Millions of people's lives are wrecked by \"rat running\" and \"outsider\nparking\". Quiet streets have been taken over by excess traffic.\n• Noise: at night 63 per cent of people are exposed to noise levels above VMO\nguidelines; during the day the figure is 52 per cent. Excess traffic is a major\ncause.\n• Global warming: over 20 per cent of our CO2 emissions are from the\ntransport sector.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n2 House Magazine 2.12.96\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\n• The CBI estimates that congestion costs industry £19 billion per year.\n• Destruction of the peace of our countryside, the ruining of the life of our\nbeautiful towns and villages caused by lorries rumbling through.\nWhat is the solution? Not simply an air quality and greener vehicles    important as\nthese are they cannot solve the problems of congestion, noise and destruction of our\ntowns. Not traffic calming; for without traffic reduction, one person's calmed area is\nanother person's newly invaded area. And not road building. We cannot afford to\nbuild our way out of this problem    and even if we could    this would not solve the\nnoise problems, and it would wreck our countryside (it has now been shown that\nbuilding roads often induces greater traffic levels). There is only one solution   a\nreduction of traffic levels. \nEDM 286 was tabled in December 1996 to coincide with Don Foster's Bill and has so far\nbeen signed by 216 Members. It states: \nThat this House is concerned that increases in road traffic will cause more\natmospheric pollution and emission of more greenhouse gases, as well as being\ndamaging to communities and the countryside; notes the similar concerns expressed\nin the recent reports by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and the\nHouse's own Transport Committee; notes, too, that the Government in its recent Air\nQuality Strategy accepts that 'changes in planning and transport policies which would\nreduce the need to travel and reliance on the car', could be needed in order to ensure\nthat air quality targets can be met; also notes that the CBI has estimated that traffic\ncongestion is costing British industry £19 billion per year; and welcomes the\nintroduction of the Road Traffic Reduction Bill by a cross-party group of honourable\nMembers led by the honourable Member for Bath, the honourable Member for Stoke\non Trent North, the honourable Member for Eltham and the honourable Member for\nCeredigion and Pembroke North, which requires local authorities to draw up local\nroad traffic reduction plans in order to reduce traffic in their areas in ways that they\nconsider appropriate to their circumstances, and which requires the Secretary of State\nto draw up and implement a national road traffic reduction plan requiring a reduction\nof traffic miles by five per cent. on 1990 levels by 2005 and a reduction of 10 per\ncent. by 2010.\nThe Bill has cross party support, and its sponsors include Peter Bottomley (Conservative),\nCynog Dafis (Plaid Cymru), and Joan Walley (Labour). This and earlier Bills have been\nendorsed by Friends of the Earth, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru who have campaigned on\nthe Bills' behalf. \n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nII Previous Bills\nThis Bill is the latest in a series of similar Bills which have been introduced in Parliament\non this topic since 1994, on all previous occasions by Cynog Dafis. \nCynog Dafis introduced his first Road Traffic (Reduction) Bill as a Private Member's Bill\nunder standing order No. 58 on 11 July 1994. Any Member may introduce this type of Bill\nthough because of the restrictions placed on their timetabling, such Bills stand little chance\nof ever being debated. That said, \"a Member who is something of an expert, or who is\nworking towards reform, in a particular field might nevertheless find it valuable to present and\nhave printed an S.O. No. 58 Bill which incorporates some of his thinking.\"3 In this case, the\nBill was not printed, though Mr Dafis put down an Early Day Motion (EDM 1520 1993/94)\nto garner support. \nMr Dafis introduced a similar Bill in the 1994/95 session under the Ten Minute Rule\nprocedure. This time it was printed and he was able to make a speech in the House.4 Again\nit was accompanied by an EDM.5\nOn 20 March 1996 Mr Dafis introduced another Bill on this topic under the same procedure.6\nThis mirrored his 1994/95 Bill. Again, it proposed that the Secretary of State for Transport\nadopt an explicit set of targets for reducing road traffic levels over the next sixteen years, so\nthat by the year 2010 road traffic in the UK would have fallen by 10% from its level in 1990.\nThe Secretary of State's action was to be mirrored by local authorities, and - should they wish\n- by parish, town and community councils, who were to draw up plans to reduce road traffic\nin their own areas. No specific targets were to be set by Parliament for these local initiatives.\nThe Secretary of State was to report on the success of his measures to Parliament on an\nannual basis, and to conduct a full review of the plan's effectiveness at least once every three\nyears. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 Private Members' Bill Procedure PIO Factsheet No 4, December 1991\n4 Bill 105 1994/95, HC Deb 25.4.95 cc. 663-5\n5 EDM 839 1994/95\n6 Bill 89 1995/96, HC Deb 20.3.96 cc. 397-400\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nDuring his speech on 25 April 1995, Mr Dafis said:\nThe Government are committed to the use of\neconomic instruments to achieve environmental\ntargets, the annual 5 per cent. real terms increase\nin petrol duty figures prominent among them. I\nwould not deny the validity of such instruments,\nwhich need to considered in the context of the\nvital debate on environmental taxation as against\ntaxation on people and employment. To depend\npurely and simply on economic instruments would\nbe ineffective, inequitable and damaging to rural\nareas such as my constituency, where there is\ncurrently little alternative to the motor car and\nwhere distribution costs are significant.\nThe Bill, which has been prepared by Friends of\nthe Earth and the Green party, approaches the\nproblem from the other direction. It requires the\nrelevant Secretary of State to draw up a United\nKingdom-wide road traffic reduction plan with\ntargets of stabilisation by the year 2000; a 5 per\ncent. reduction in traffic by 2005; and a 10\nper cent. reduction by 2010. Local authorities are\nrequired to draw up plans for reducing traffic\nthrough measures related to public transport and\nrail transport, appropriate planning policies, traffic\ncalming, pedestrianisation and public education.\nAnd on 20 March 1996, Mr. Dafis commented:\nLast week, the Department of the Environment\npublished its important \"Indicators of sustainable\ndevelopment for the United Kingdom\" document.\nThe section on transport makes dismal reading.\nIt reports that car use has almost doubled to an\naverage of 6,500 miles a year per person,\nalthough use of buses has declined by one quarter\nto an average 600 miles a year and rail use has\nremained only constant at an average 400 miles a\nyear. The average distance of commuter journeys\nhas increased by 40 per cent. since 1974, journeys\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nfor shopping by 35 per cent. and those for taking\nchildren to and from school by 40 per cent.\nEnergy consumption for road passengers has\nnearly doubled and for freight it has increased by\nmore than 60 per cent. since 1970, so any\nimprovements in vehicles' energy efficiency has\nbeen more than cancelled out. The fact that the\naverage Briton travels less for each gallon of fuel\nconsumed than in 1970 is shocking and illustrates\nthat technological improvements in energy\nefficiency, welcome though they are, do not\nprovide the answer to the problem.\nThe Government's pioneering document\ndemonstrates clearly that our current transport\nsystem    let alone what we will have if\nprojections are only partly fulfilled    is utterly\nunsustainable.\nThe Bill's sponsors argued that it is by a combination of explicit targets, and public\naccountability, that a steady reduction in road use may be guaranteed. Clearly, underlying this\naim is the argument that the unchecked growth in road traffic will have seriously detrimental\neffects on the quality of life in this country. \nEDM 21 1995/96 was supportive of the Bill's aims; it was tabled by one of the Bill's\nsponsors, Frank Cook, although it predated the introduction of the 1995/96 Bill and referred\ninstead to Mr Dafis's 1994/95 Bill. It had 119 signatories. \n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nIII Traffic Figures\nThe Department of Transport's practice has been to produce long-term forecasts of road traffic\n(that is, vehicle-kilometres), rather than overall forecasts of movements of people and goods.\nThese forecasts have covered Great Britain for a period of at least 30 years ahead and were\nproduced approximately every five years during the 1980s. At one time they were given the\nstatus of government policy statements; more recently their primary purpose has been\ndescribed as facilitating economic appraisal of proposals to build or improve trunk roads or\nmotorways. The most recent forecasts are the National Road Traffic Forecasts made in 1989.7\n  \nTwo forecasts were published: a high forecast of a 142% increase in traffic between 1988 and\n2025 and a low forecast of an 83% increase. It was assumed that rising real incomes would\nspread the lifestyles, at present characteristic of higher income groups, to a larger and larger\nproportion of the population. The forecast levels of traffic were largely determined by the\nassumptions made about economic growth. Separate forecasts of future traffic levels were\nmade for each class of vehicle. The assumptions made for car ownership were that the\nprevious relationship between increases in income and increases in car ownership would\ncontinue to apply until 90% of the population of driving age (17-74) owned a car. This is\nthe level of car ownership which the Department of Transport consider to be saturation level\nfor Great Britain. \nThe above level of car ownership is broadly equivalent to 600 cars per 1,000 people which\nexisted in the USA as a whole in 1990. The 1988 ratio for the UK was 331 cars per 1,000\npeople. The low forecast of traffic growth made in 1989 implied that this ratio would\nincrease to 529 cars per 1,000 people in 2025, the high forecast that it would increase to 608\ncars per 1,000 people by that date. The Eighteenth Report of the Royal Commission on\nEnvironmental Pollution suggested that the saturation level would not necessarily be the same\nin Britain as in a wealthier and less densely populated country such as the USA.8 It has been\nargued that saturation level has nearly been reached in the USA and that saturation level in\nother countries will be much lower.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n7 Department of Transport National Road Traffic Forecasts: Great Britain 1989\n8 Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution Eighteenth Report Transport and the Environment 1994\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nThere may be arguments as to the actual saturation level of car ownership in the UK but the\nDepartment of Transport anticipates that the level of car ownership in the UK will continue\nto increase for many years:9\n\"Although UK car ownership is at historically high levels, expectations of economic growth coupled\nwith the experience of other countries with high standards of living indicate that car ownership and\nmileage driven could well go on increasing for many years.\" \nThe Royal Commission Report points out that there is no simple relationship between car use\nand ownership and GDP per head. It looked at the car use and distance travelled in ten\ndeveloped countries in relation to wealth. Of these ten countries Britain has the lowest GDP\nper head but came seventh in terms of car ownership per thousand people and third in the\naverage distance travelled by car annually.10 \nNicholas James and Tim Pharaoh wrote a paper which contained a table of car ownership and\nuse in western countries in 1988 and stated that Britain was half or two-thirds of the way\ntowards car saturation.11 Clearly the rate at which car ownership increases from now in the\nUK will depend on various economic and social factors. A study by the Transport Studies\nUnit, University of Oxford looked at the traffic growth forecasts and the effects of the\nincrease in number of cars per household.12 Chapter 6 considered in particular the effects\nof the growth of women in the workforce. It mentioned a Swedish study that found that\nwhereas the rate of increase in car ownership is slowing down among men and nearing\nsaturation point the increase in car ownership for women has only just begun. \nThree recent PQs are relevant:\nTraffic Congestion\nMr. David Marshall: To ask the Secretary of\nState for Transport what estimate he has made of\n(a) the percentage increase in traffic on roads by\nthe year 2005 and (b) the cost of consequent\ndelays and inefficiencies.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n9 Department of Transport Managing the trunk road programme November 1995\n10 Op cit Figure 2-VI\n11 Travel Sickness: The Need for a Sustainable Transport Policy edited by John Roberts et al \"The Traffic Generation\nGame\" \n12 Transport Studies Unit Transport: The New Realism 1991\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nMr. Watts: The Department's most recent\nforecasts show road traffic in 2005 between 16\nper cent. and 26 per cent. higher than in 1996.\nThe Department does not make estimates of the\nnational cost of delays and inefficiencies. These\ncosts at a national level are very difficult concepts\nto pin down. Others have made estimates of the\nUK cost of congestion on the basis of work\ncarried out by the Organisation for Economic\nCongestion and Development some six years ago.\nHowever, the method used contains a number of\ngross simplifications and the results are\nconsequently unreliable.\nOur own assessments focus on the appraisal of\nindividual transport projects.

It is not possible to\nsuccessfully reproduce the maps because of the colour. \n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nIV Effects of Congestion\nThere has been increasing concern in recent years about the economic cost of road congestion\nas well as the environmental effects of pollution from car traffic. A study by the British Road\nFederation estimated that the cost of congestion in Britain's main conurbations in 1985/86\namounted to £3.2 billion.14 The CBI has estimated that the nationwide costs of congestion\nare around £15 billion per annum of which some £10 billion can be attributed to the problems\nof London and the South-East.15\nMore recently the Department of Transport has produced a review of the literature on the cost\nof environmental externalities16 and announced that it was pressing ahead with further work\nto see how far it was possible to put a value on the environmental costs of transport.17 The\nenvironmental effects of transport include noise, air pollution, climate change, landtake and\nlandscape. The review found that it might be possible to derive values for the effects of noise\nand the health effects of pollution but that the values for climate change damage were less\nreliable. It concluded that values for landtake and the effect on landscape could not be\nderived. The report identified the range of values appearing in the literature for the cost of\nnoise and pollution effects. The total cost estimates for noise pollution for transport are\nwithin a range of £2.17 billion to £3.95 billion per annum with an allocation of 86% for road,\n10% for air and 4% for rail. The total cost estimates for the transport related health impacts\nof local air pollution in urban areas ranged from £1.2 billion to £3.4 billion per annum.\nThe Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution found that emissions from road vehicles\nwere the main influence on air quality over large areas of the UK in which there are no\nsignificant industrial emissions. The main air pollutants are carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide\nvolatile organic compounds, particulates and sulphur dioxide. With the exception of sulphur\ndioxide, most of which comes from power stations, transport produces most of these with\nalmost all emissions coming from road transport.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 British Road Reduction The Price of Congestion in Inner London\n15 CBI Transport in London Task Force Report The Capital at Risk 1989\n16 Department of Transport The Valuation of Environmental Externalities\n17 Department of Transport press notice no 364 13. 11.95\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nV The Government's View of Targets\nThe Government stated its opposition to specific targets for road traffic reduction in a written\nanswer of 29 June 1993,18 arguing that it was for businesses and individuals to decide how\nto travel. It did enumerate, however, a number of measures which were designed to reduce\ncongestion and limit the environmental impact of transport choices:\nTraffic Volume\nMs Walley: To ask the Secretary of State for\nTransport (1) if he will consider setting targets for\ntraffic flow reductions (a) within urban areas and\n(b) on inter-urban roads; and if he will make a\nstatement;\n(2) if he will list the initiatives he is assessing\nto reduce traffic flows and the use of private\nvehicles; and if he will set targets for each\ninitiative.\nMr. Key: The Government set no targets for\nreducing traffic flows: it is for individuals and\nbusinesses to decide where and how to travel.\nNevertheless the Government do have a\nresponsibility to ensure that, collectively,\nindividual decisions do not have unacceptable\nconsequences for the environment.\nPolicies aimed at reducing congestion and the\nenvironmental impacts of traffic include:\n  measures to reduce harmful emissions from\nvehicles (particularly through requiring 3-way\ncatalytic converters to be fitted to new cars);\n  the annual increases in fuel duty announced in\nthe March budget;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n18 HC Deb 29.6.93 c. 425w\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\n  the programme of research into road pricing in\nLondon;\n  high levels of investment in public transport;\n  assistance for local authorities in introducing\ntraffic calming measures;\n  assistance for local authorities in developing\nstrategies for urban areas, supported by\ninvestment in all forms of transport;\n  the recently-issued draft planning policy\nguidance note (PPG 13) on reducing the need to\ntravel;\n  investment in bypasses, included in the current\nroads programme.\nThe Green Paper, Transport: the Way Ahead was the Government's response to the national\ndebate on transport it initiated and sets out its views on a variety of issues.19 The\nGovernment is still not yet convinced of the efficacy of national targets for reducing traffic\nlevels although it does endorse them at a local level. Its views are set out in the conclusions\nto chapter 13 \"Targets and traffic growth\" as follows:\nConclusion\n13.24 The Government accepts the need for measures which influence traffic, and reduce\ntraffic growth. But in the light of the discussion above, the Government is not so far convinced\nthat national traffic targets would be practicable. There is too great a risk of imposing costs on\nsociety which would not be justified by the benefits produced.\n13.25 The Government believes a more effective approach is to focus measures directly\non the impacts of transport supported, where appropriate, by specific targets for reducing those\nimpacts.\n13.26 Traffic targets can, however, be a useful and sensible tool for dealing with specific\nsituations at local level and for helping to focus attention on strategies and measures needed. The\nGovernment will therefore monitor closely the progress which local authorities are making on the\ngreater use of traffic targets and the effects on traffic levels of the measures described elsewhere\nin the paper.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n19 Department of Transport Transport - the Way Ahead April 1996 Cm 3234 \n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\n13.27 The Government will keep the case for national traffic targets under review, in\nparticular by encouraging local authorities to provide their views on this issue.\n13.28 Paragraphs 13.18-13.20 above noted the importance of adapting targets to local\ncircumstances. In the case of traffic targets, not only are most problems of traffic (as opposed\nto problems of emissions) essentially local in character, so most of the practical measures for\ndealing with traffic are best applied at local level. This is notably true in urban areas: the next\nchapter looks in closer detail at the challenges presented by urban transport, and how local\nauthorities can respond.\nThe whole of this chapter explains the background to the Government's views on targets.\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nVI Other Policy Options\nTransport planners have been trying to reduce the impact of the private car in urban areas for\nmany years and concern about air quality and the economic consequences of congestion is\nparticularly strong at present. Physical policies are used to discourage the use of the car such\nas the stricter enforcement of parking controls, allowing public transport to have priority by\ninstalling bus lanes and giving bus priority at traffic lights and the introduction of park and\nride schemes. Exhortation to leave your car home continues but seems to have little effect.\nCar drivers are much in favour of better public transport and its increased use - but usually\nonly for everyone else. Despite efforts urban traffic congestion is still rife, and probably\ngrowing in most cities. \nSome policy options which are either being tried or have been suggested for curbing traffic\ncongestion in cities are considered briefly.\n1. Increase infrastructure supply (invest more in roads and rail)\nThe Department of Transport has forecast that car use by the year 2025 will increase by\nbetween 83% and 142%.20 Clearly it would be impossible to build roads to cope with this\nincrease in the volume of cars quite apart from the environmental objections. A decision was\ntaken in March 1990 not to proceed with the major road building schemes in London\nrecommended by the London assessment studies. This was largely as a result of local\nobjections. Nevertheless some major investment in trunk road schemes has taken place in the\nlast five years, for example, the Limehouse link to East London and Docklands, the M11 link\nbetween Hackney and the M11, improvements to the A13 and a new river crossing, the\nprivately financed Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, at Dartford. However in March 1994 in the\nDepartment of Transport's review of the trunk road programme the conclusions on road\npriorities included: \"the programme of major urban road improvements should be a very\nlimited one, in the light of continuing substantial investment in urban transport initiatives.\"21 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n20 Department of Transport Roads to Prosperity 1989 Cm 693\n21 Department of Transport Review of the Trunk Road Network March 1994\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nSeveral major public transport projects are either under construction or planned for London.\nAn extension to the Jubilee Line to Stratford via Docklands and the Greenwich peninsula is\nunder construction and due to be completed in 1998 at a cost of around £1.9 billion.\nThameslink 2000, an extension of the existing cross London rail line from St Pancras to\nLondon Bridge, is to be built to coincide with the opening of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link\nin about 2003 at a cost of some £650 million. A shorter term and rather cheaper public\ntransport solution for congestion is a light rapid transit system. These systems include light\nrail, tramways and guided buses and there are some 45 light rail and related schemes being\nplanned in the UK. \n2. Reduce or restrict demand (traffic calming or restrictions and/or\nreductions in the need to travel) \nIn a debate on transport and the environment in October 1994, the Minister for Transport in\nLondon, Steve Norris, noted that a degree of compulsion was required in encouraging drivers\nto give up their cars when travelling into cities: \"It is obvious that it is not enough simply to\napply the carrot; one must also apply the stick, whether that be physical restraint on vehicles -\n park and ride, and local parking control, which is obviously important - or pricing, which is\na vital component.\" 22\na. Traffic Calming\nAlthough traffic calming has been seen mainly as a road safety measure whereby traffic\nspeeds are reduced and accidents prevented, it can also be a means of promoting alternative\nmodes of transport to the car, pedestrian, public and bicycle transport. The Traffic Calming\nAct 1992, which resulted from a Private Member's Bill introduced by Keith Mans, empowers\nhighway authorities to construct traffic calming works authorised by the Secretary of State.\nPreviously there was only clear legal authority for the installation of road humps. Many\nhighway authorities had been discouraged from implementing traffic calming schemes such\nas chicanes or rumble strips for fear of prosecution for causing an obstruction in the road but\nsince the passing of the 1992 Act many towns and villages have had traffic calming schemes\nimplemented.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n22 HC Deb 31.10.94 c. 1313\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nb. Bus Lanes\nBus lanes are road lanes where buses have priority. Figures estimated by London Transport\nin 1989 showed that out of 1,800 miles of route network only 50 miles (less than 1.5% of the\nnetwork) had bus lanes but these provided net benefits of around £20 million a year.23\nc. Park and ride schemes\nThese are arrangements whereby cars are left in out-of-town car parks and buses are provided\nto take drivers into town centres. \nd. Pedestrianisation and car-free zones\ne. Red routes\nThese are routes where stopping is strictly controlled to ease the flow of traffic. Double red\nlines indicate that stopping is prohibited at any time and single red lines indicate where\nstopping is prohibited at certain times. The only exemptions to red line restrictions are buses\nat stops and stands, licensed taxis picking up or setting down passengers, to pick up and put\ndown a disabled person, for emergency purposes and to avoid an accident.\nf. Parking enforcement\nPart II of the Road Traffic Act 1991 established arrangements for the decriminalisation of\nmost non-endorsable parking offences in London (except on major routes) and provides scope\nfor similar arrangements to be introduced outside London. Parking then becomes the\nresponsibility of local authorities who employ parking attendants to take on the role of traffic\nwardens. Local authorities are able to keep the penalty charges paid by errant motorists so\nmore enforcement is possible at no extra cost to council tax payers. Police and traffic\nwardens retain control of illegal parking on the red routes and associated main roads. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n23 LRT press notice 21.2.89, no 262\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\ng. `High-occupancy vehicle' lanes\nThese are special road lanes for the exclusive use of cars carrying two or more people. They\nare well established in the USA, notably in Los Angeles, where they have helped to reduce\ntraffic volumes. These schemes are easier to operate in the US on freeways with large\nnumbers of lanes. \nh. Car sharing\nCar-sharing in this country is thought of as a scheme for sharing a journey to work. The\ngovernment supports the idea but gives no particular financial incentives.24 \ni. Advanced transport telematics (ATT)\nThe ROMANSE - Road Management System for Europe - is a three year pilot project based\nin Southampton. Its aim is to use ATT to develop the city as a model for an overall transport\nmanagement system. The idea is that it provides real time traffic and travel information to\ninfluence travel behaviour, increase the use of public transport, maximise the efficiency of the\ntransport system and provide high quality information for use in strategic policy decisions.\n3. Road pricing (congestion charging)\nThe theoretical case for what has come to be termed `road pricing' derives from the rationale\nthat the users of roads, like the users of any other valuable and limited resource, should pay\nall the costs arising from their use. Only then will the decisions on whether, when, where and\nhow to travel be made correctly. Road users are currently charged for the right to use roads\nbut the marginal use is largely \"free\". Congestion costs money and a road pricing system\nwhich assesses congestion can ensure those who contribute to it, pay for it.\nThe practical case for road pricing stems from the fact that traffic conditions have reached a\nstate where business interests are being seriously damaged and the quality of life for a\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n24 HC Deb 5.3.96 c. 149\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\ngrowing proportion of individuals is worsening because of the direct and indirect effects of\ntraffic congestion. Other techniques, such as traffic regulation, parking controls and public\ntransport subsidies, can help combat congestion but the difficulties of enforcement and\nfinancial constraints mean that these traditional methods are unlikely to be able to cope with\nrising road traffic volumes. Road pricing will also have direct implications for public\ntransport, although these may be less than is hoped. \nThe main objections to road pricing have been that it is unfair and impractical. Rich drivers\nare of course bound to find charges less burdensome than poor drivers. On the other hand,\nonly 20 per cent of the poorest quarter of households own a car compared with 93 per cent\nof the richest. Road pricing, by improving traffic flow, ought to improve the efficiency of\nbus services which are used disproportionately by the low paid. Drivers must not see road\npricing as a system for discouraging other drivers, but accept it could affect all those who live\nwithin the controlled area.\nFears about the technology seem to be misplaced. The technology does appear to be available\nand experience overseas would seem to show that road pricing is practicable. A system has\nto be capable of handling automatically large flows of moving traffic and of processing\ncashless transactions. There must be no record of individuals' journeys as this is seen as an\nunacceptable intrusion into people's lives. \nEnforcement could be a problem as millions of extra offences could need to be checked,\ninvestigated and prosecuted each year. The new technology which is being used increasingly\nin the transport area should be able to overcome this to some extent.\nThere are a number of different forms of road pricing:\nToll Roads where a single charge is levied for driving on a particular road. The charge\ncan be varied according to the time of the day or week. This form of road pricing is\nmore suitable for motorways and estuarial crossings. It is already used for the latter,\nthe Dartford Tunnel and Bridge, The Severn Bridge, The Forth Bridge etc.\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nSupplementary Licensing (also known as Area Licensing or Cordon Charges) where\na single charge is levied for entering a specified area. A special sticker has to be\ndisplayed in the windscreen and cars are checked as they drive past enforcement\npoints. There are two main disadvantages of this system. It creates a cordon effect\nencouraging people to dump their cars at the boundary causing congestion there. The\nother disadvantage is that it imposes the same charge on someone momentarily\ncrossing the border as on someone spending the whole day driving round the\ncongested city centre. \nElectronic Road Pricing (ERP) where the charge varies according to both time and\nplace. Charges operate within specified areas and are higher at peak hours. Cars were\nfitted with an electronic smartcard which is read by electronic loops in the road\nsurface. Motorists are then presented with bills according to their use of the roads.\n4. The Government's Attitude \nThe Government's attitude to many of these policies is set out in the Green Paper Transport\n- the Way Ahead. Chapter 14 \"Urban Transport\" of that document discusses the means by\nwhich traffic can be controlled. The main points are summarised as overleaf:\n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nDealing with traffic growth\n14.9 The Government does not, in general, support investment in roads which are\nlikely to add to traffic in town centres. However, there is a continuing need for many\nother types of road improvement, which can help tackle congestion and improve\nsafety. To this end, more than 800 local authority road schemes have been accepted\nfor funding by Transport Supplementary Grant since 1985 totalling more than £5\nbillion.\n14.10 It is important to distinguish between schemes whose purpose is to tunnel\nmore traffic into urban centres, and those highway improvements which complement\nwider strategies or are aimed at improving road layout. For smaller towns, and even\nlocal centres within conurbations, bypasses may offer a practical option for removing\nthrough-traffic from congested areas. The creation of new capacity on one route\nprovides a specific opportunity to install traffic calming measures on the routes thus\nrelieved of heavy traffic.\n14.11 A range of traffic management techniques can be used for different objectives:\nto smooth traffic flows; reduce noise and air pollution in sensitive areas; and to\nimprove safety. Lower speed limits can be especially effective: over two hundred and\nfifty 20 mph zones have so far been introduced, incorporating a range of traffic\ncalming features. Analysis of the first hundred zones has indicated a reduction of 56\nper cent in annual accident frequency, and a reduction of 74 per cent in casualties to\nchildren and cyclists.\n14.12 Some people have expressed concerns about potential environmental damage\narising from traffic calming - the fear being that measures which slow or interrupt\ntraffic flow may create local air quality or noise problems. The Government is\ncommissioning research on the environmental effects of traffic management.\n14.13 Improving the way we manage and control traffic in urban areas will be\nimportant. Driver information needs to be clear - signs must be visible and legible,\nand it is important that visual clutter be avoided and consistency and continuity\nmaintained. The Government has already issued guidance to local authorities on good\ndirection signing. The SCOOT urban traffic control system has been very successful\nin reducing delays and smoothing traffic flows. Recent improvements enable SCOOT\nto give priority to buses and cope with congestion incidents. The Government will\nbe commissioning further research in this area, aiming to develop systems that help\nto improve conditions for pedestrians and cyclists and improve air quality.\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nLocal strategies\n14.14 Where the volume of traffic would otherwise cause undue congestion or\nenvironmental impacts in a town or city, the Government supports the implementation\nof measures to discourage car use. Many people will still need or choose to drive.\nBut restraint measures may have a part to play in a coherent local strategy, based on\nmeeting access needs for individuals and businesses, that gets the most efficient use\nout of the road network.\n4.15 Local authorities already have extensive powers to regulate and restrain car\nuse. They can:\nregulate the availability of on-street and publicly owned off-street car\nparking. The location, price, and total amount of parking can be\nvaried. For instance, where a park and ride service is provided, it\nmay be appropriate to reduce the amount of parking in the town\ncentre. Planning authorities are encouraged to apply tighter parking\nstandards at new developments where accessibility can be maintained\nby other means;\nrestrict vehicular access to particular roads or areas by traffic\nregulation order. It is possible, for instance, only to allow buses and\nessential vehicles into a town centre, or to restrict vehicular access to\ncertain times of day;\nreallocate road space from car use to dedicated facilities for buses,\ncyclists or pedestrians. Creating and effectively enforcing bus and\ncycle lanes, or bus only streets, has the additional advantage of\nmaking those alternative modes more attractive;\nimplement physical traffic calming measures to discourage \"rat\nrunning\" through residential areas.\n14.16 Controls on parking are at present perhaps the most important tool, since\navailability of parking spaces, and the cost of parking to motorists, can have a major\ninfluence on the level of traffic entering a town. The Government has supported local\nauthorities in considering more active means to manage parking availability, by\nincreasing charges generally or changing the balance between long-stay and short-stay\nparking, for example to encourage shoppers at the expense of commuters. The\nGovernment is also keen to see car parks managed and maintained efficiently, with\nday-to-day operation undertaken by the private sector.\n29\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\n14.17 The Government is conducting research into the role of parking policies on\ntraffic levels and economic activity, and will work with local authorities on new\nguidelines in the light of this research.\n14.18 Charging drivers to enter congested city centres - congestion charging - is\noften suggested as an effective means of reducing congestion and pollution and\nimproving journey speeds and reliability. As part of its programme of research into\na range of urban transport issues, the Government conducted a major study of the\npossible implications of implementing congestion charging in London, and supported\nresearch by local authorities elsewhere. The report on the London research\nprogramme was published in 1995.25\n14.19 This work has significantly advanced knowledge of the advantages and\ndisadvantages of charging. It confirmed the potential benefits, specifically the\npotential congestion charging offered to bring about a significant reduction in traffic\nlevels in the charged area, with consequent improvements to journey speeds and\nreliability and reductions in emission levels. But it also identified a number of\ncomplex issues, relating primarily to administration and enforcement, that need to be\naddressed before congestion charging could become a realistic policy option. The\nGovernment concluded on that basis that a congestion charging scheme could not be\nimplemented this century, but that work should continue on the subject. Further\nresearch and development is in progress, in partnership with interested local\nauthorities.\n14.20 Some respondents to the transport debate suggested that local authorities\nshould have wider powers, for example, to implement restraint measures including\ncongestion charging on an experimental basis. This is something the Government is\nprepared to consider.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n25 The London Congestion Charging Researching Programme, Principal Findings, Government Office for\nLondon, July 1995.\n30\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/9\nVII Further Reading\nSpeech by Cynog Dafis HC Deb 25.4.95 cc 663-5\nSpeech by Cynog Dafis HC Deb. 20 March 1996, cc.397-400\nRoyal Commission on Environmental Pollution Eighteenth Report \"Transport and the\nEnvironment\" 1994\nSelect Committee on Transport, Urban Road Pricing, 22 March 1995 HC 104-I 1994-95\nDebate on urban road congestion HC Deb 8.2.95 cc 282-302\nDepartment of Transport Transport - the Way Ahead  April 1996 Cm 3234\n31\n\n\n\n"

It is also designed to enable the UK courts to\nprosecute British citizens or residents who commit certain sexual acts abroad against children.\nThis paper considers the provisions of the Bill and other related subjects, including the\nquestion of public access to information about sex offenders. \nMary Baber\nHome Affairs Section\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

It will also give our courts the power to\npenalise those who engage in the evil trade of child prostitution overseas.\nPart I of the Sex Offenders Bill [Bill 66 of 1996-97], which is considered in the first chapter\nof this paper, is designed to implement the Government's proposal by requiring those people\nwho are convicted of or cautioned in respect of certain specified sex offences in England and\nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to notify the police of their names and addresses and\nany subsequent changes. The proposals for sex offender registration are distinct from\nprovisions in Part V of the Police Bill [HL Bill 10 of 1996-97], which are intended to enable\ncriminal conviction certificates to be issued to prospective employees in general, and to\nenable criminal record certificates and enhanced criminal record certificates to be issued to\napplicants for particular types of paid and unpaid work. They are also distinct from proposals\nfor permitting public access to the register of sex offenders or otherwise notifying the public\nof the presence of convicted sex offenders in the community. The Government is currently\nconsulting with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) about how information about\nsex offenders is currently disclosed by police forces and how such information might be made\navailable in future. The Government's proposals for change in the arrangements concerning\naccess to criminal records for employment and other related purposes are summarised in the\nthird chapter of this paper, which also describes arrangements in the USA for public\nnotification of the presence of sex offenders in particular communities.\nPart II of the Sex Offenders Bill, which is considered in the second chapter of this paper, is\ndesigned to confer extra-territorial jurisdiction on the courts in England and Wales, Scotland\nand Northern Ireland in respect of certain sexual offences committed abroad by British\ncitizens or UK residents.\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nI. Notification Requirements for Sex Offenders\nA. Background\nCompulsory registration schemes for different types of offences have been in place in some\nstates in the USA for many years. In a paper published in the Howard Journal of Criminal\nJustice in May 1996, Bill Hebenton and Terry Thomas note that in most US states which\nrequire sex offenders to be registered the requirement applies to convicted offenders; in some\nit applies to individuals found to have committed a sexual offence by judicial decision (such\nas those found not guilty by reason of insanity); in one state (Minnesota) the requirement has\nbeen extended to those charged with sexual offences. They also report that there is\nconsiderable variation between states on which types of offender to include in a registry, with\nsome states only registering adult offenders and others only registering adult offenders whose\nvictims were under 181. Under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994\nstates in the USA are required to enact statutes or regulations requiring those considered to\nbe \"sexually violent predators\" or who are convicted of sexually violent offences, to register\nwith appropriate law enforcement agencies for ten years after release form prison. States\nwhich fail to establish registration schemes may have Federal grant money reduced.\nOn 27 March 1996 Janet Anderson presented a Sexual Offences against Children (Register\nof Offenders) Bill2 which was intended to provide for the maintenance of registers of people\nconvicted of certain sexual offences against children. Under the Bill's provisions, the\ninformation in the registers would have been available to those public bodies, charities and\nother persons or bodies involved in work with children but not to the wider public. On June\n12 1996 Anthony Coombs presented a Ten Minute Rule Bill to control and monitor convicted\npaedophiles. Neither of these Bills progressed any further, but there were increasing calls,\nfrom the police and others for the establishment of such a register.\nThe Government set out proposals for a requirement that those convicted of sexual offences\nnotify changes of address with the police in its consultation paper Sentencing and Supervision\nof Sex Offenders, published in June 1996.3 The Government set out the background to its\nproposal and its view of the purpose which such a requirement might serve:4\n                                                                                                                                                 \n1\n\"Tracking\" Sex Offenders - Howard Journal of Criminal Justice May 1996 p.97-112\n2 Bill 91 of 1995-96\n3 Cm 3304 paras 41-63\n4 ibid. paras 42-43\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\n42. There have, separately, been proposals,\nnotably by the Superintendents Association, that\nthere should be a national register of those\nconvicted of sexual offences against children. Most\nrecently, Ms Janet Anderson MP brought forward\na Bill (The Sexual Offences against Children\n(Registers of Offenders) Bill) which proposed a\nduty on the Secretary of State to maintain registers\nof those convicted of sexual offences against\nchildren. The Bill also made provision for access\nto these registers by certain categories of\norganisations, with a view to vetting those who\nmight seek employment on a paid or voluntary\nbasis, which would involve access to children.\n43. The purpose of requiring convicted sex\noffenders to notify the police of any change of\naddress would be to ensure that the information on\nconvicted sex offenders contained within the police\nnational computer was fully up to date. At the\nmoment, information held in the National Criminal\nRecord collection will only contain the last address\nknown to the police, usually the one at which the\noffender was residing when he was convicted. The\nmajor drawback with the records as they stand at\npresent is that the local police have no means of\nlearning from them whether a convicted sex\noffender has moved into their area. If the police\nwere armed with this information, it could not only\nhelp them to identify suspects once a crime had\nbeen committed, but could also possibly help them\nto prevent such crimes. It might also act as a\ndeterrent to potential reoffenders.\nThe requirement that certain sex offenders notify the police of their names and addresses is\nset out in Part I of the Sex Offenders Bill, which was published on 18 December 1996. \nB. Offences to which the notification requirement will apply\nThe offences to which it is intended that the notification requirement should apply are listed\nin Schedule 1 to the Bill, which is set out in the appendix to this paper. The requirement to\nregister principally applies to those convicted of offences against children, although those\nconvicted, dealt with or cautioned in respect of offences of rape, attempted rape and in some\ncases indecent assault involving adults will also be required to register. \nIn England and Wales, the offences of intercourse with a girl between 13 and 16, buggery,\nand indecency between men are excluded where the offender was under 20. The offences of\nincest by a man, buggery, indecency between men, and assault with intent to commit buggery\ndo not apply where the victim or other party to the offence was 18 or over. The offences of\nindecent assault on a man or indecent assault on a woman do not apply where the victim or\nother party to the offence was 18 or over, unless the offence is one in respect of which the\noffender has been sentenced to imprisonment for 30 months or more (a sentence which\nwould only be available to the Crown Court) or has been admitted to hospital subject to a\nrestriction order. Similar restrictions apply to the offences to which the notification\nrequirement will apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nConsensual heterosexual acts between people who are aged 16 or over (17 in Northern\nIreland) are not generally subject to criminal sanction except in the case of buggery, where\nthe age of consent is 18, or incest. The age of consent for homosexual acts in private was\nlowered from 21 to 18 by section 145 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order 1994. In its\nbriefing on the Sex Offenders Bill the lesbian and gay rights group Stonewall, which has\ncampaigned for an equal age of consent for both homosexual and heterosexual acts, criticises\nthe inclusion of offences involving consenting homosexual sex with 16 or 17 year olds in the\nlist of offences to which the notification requirement will apply. It notes that there is no\nequivalent requirement to register those who have consenting heterosexual sex with 16 or 17\nyear olds, since this is not generally an offence. Stonewall states that the effect of the\nadditional provisions concerning the age of offenders convicted of certain consenting sex\noffences will be that a young gay man of 20 having a relationship with a 17 year old could\nbe prosecuted, convicted and required to register as a dangerous sex offender. It adds that\neven if the police felt that the matter was not serious enough to warrant prosecution and such\na man was cautioned, he would still have to register as a sex offender5. In its briefing on the\nBill Liberty also takes the view that the Bill will \"highlight the discriminatory nature of the\ncriminal law as it relates to homosexual sex in the United Kingdom\"6.\nC. Retrospective and prospective application of the notification\nrequirement\nClause 1 of the Sex Offenders Bill seeks to establish the circumstances in which people who\nare found to have committed certain specified sexual offences may be required to notify the\npolice of their names and addresses and of any subsequent changes. The Home Office press\nnotice issued on the day of the Bill's publication notes that the registration requirement is\nintended to be retrospective and that it will apply to offenders who are in custody or under\nsupervision in the community7. The retrospective elements of the requirement may be the\nsubject of some criticism as there is a general principle and a general presumption of statutory\nconstruction that, except in relation to procedural matters, changes in the law should not take\neffect retrospectively. Bennion on Statute Law observes that8:\nA person is presumed to know the law, and is required to obey the law. It\nfollows that he should be able to trust the law. Having fulfilled his duty to\nknow the law, he should then be able to act on his knowledge with\nconfidence. The rule of law means nothing else. It follows that to alter the\nlaw retrospectively, at least where that is to the disadvantage of the\nsubject,, is a betrayal of what law stands for. Parliament is presumed not\nto intend such betrayal. \n                                                                                                                                                 \n5 Stonewall Briefing on the Sex Offenders Bill - January 1997\n6 The Sex Offenders Bill: Liberty Briefing January 1997\n7 New measures to tackle sex offenders.... - Home Office 18.12.1996\n8 Third Edition p.151\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nAs Bennion notes, the principle against retrospectivity is a presumption, rather than a hard and\nfast rule. It may therefore be rebutted. Where, however, the courts are considering the\napplication of a particular statutory provision in relation to an individual case and it seems\nto the court that some retrospective effect was intended, the presumption against\nretrospectivity indicates that this should be kept to as narrow a compass as will accord with\nthe legislative intention.9\nArticle 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that: \n1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act\nor omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or\ninternational law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier\npenalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal\noffence was committed.\n2. This article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for\nany act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal\naccording to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations. \nThe categories of convicted sex offender on which registration requirements are to be imposed\nunder Clause 1, those on whom the requirement will not be imposed, and the circumstances\nin which these requirements may apply retrospectively, may be summarised as follows:\nTable: Sex Offender registration requirements under Clause 1 and their\nretrospective application\nCategories  of  Offenders\n1. Where, after commencement, offender is\nconvicted, found not guilty by reason of\ninsanity etc. or cautioned.\n2. Where, at the time of commencement,\noffender has been convicted, found guilty by\nreason of insanity etc. but has not yet been\nsentenced or otherwise dealt with.\nApplication  of  registration  requirement\nRequirement will apply. Possible retrospective\napplication where offence was committed\nbefore commencement.\nRequirement will apply. Retrospective\napplication, as offence will have been\ncommitted before commencement.\n                                                                                                                                                 \n9 Lauri v Renad [1892] 3 Ch 402, 421; Skinner v Cooper [1979] 1 WLR 666\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nCategories  of  Offenders\n3. Where, at the time of commencement,\noffender has been convicted and sentenced or\notherwise dealt with, and is serving a sentence\nof imprisonment or a term of service detention,\nor is subject to a community order, or is\nsubject to supervision, having been released\nfrom prison, or is detained in hospital or\nsubject to a guardianship order following\nconviction, or is detained in hospital having\nbeen found not guilty by reason of insanity etc.\n4. Where, at the time of commencement\noffender has served a sentence of\nimprisonment, and is no longer subject to\nsupervision following release, or is no longer\nsubject to a community order, or where\noffender has been released from hospital and is\nnot subject to a guardianship order.\nApplication  of  registration  requirement\nRequirement will apply. Retrospective\napplication as offence will have been\ncommitted before commencement.\nRequirement will not apply. Application\nwould be retrospective as offence would have\nbeen committed before commencement.\nUnder Clause 1(1) it is thus intended that individuals should become subject to the\nnotification requirement if, after the commencement of this Part of the Bill they are either\ncautioned (in England and Wales and Northern Ireland) by a police constable in respect of\nan offence which they admit at the time the caution is given, or they are convicted, found\nnot guilty by reason of insanity, or found to be under a disability and to have done the act\ncharged against them.\nWhere the act complained of took place after the commencement of this part of the Bill there\nwill be no retrospective element in Clause 1(1), but claims of retrospectivity might be made\nwhere the person was convicted (or found not guilty by reason of insanity etc.) after\ncommencement but the act in respect of which they were charged took place before\ncommencement when notification was not required. \nUnder Clause 1(2) a person will also be subject to the notification requirement if, at the time\nwhen this Part of the Bill is brought into force, he has already been convicted of one of the\nspecified sexual offences (or found not guilty of it by reason of insanity etc.) but has not yet\nbeen sentenced or otherwise dealt with in respect of the conviction or finding. It will not\napply where an offender was dealt with by being cautioned by a police constable. Claims of\nretrospectivity may be made in respect of the requirement under Clause 1(2) as it will clearly\napply the notification requirement, which may be seen as a \"heavier penalty\", to cases where\nthis penalty was not available at the time when the offence was committed. The same is true\nof Clause 1(3), under which the notification requirement will apply where, at the time when\nthis Part of the Bill is brought into force, a person has been convicted of a specified sexual\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\noffence, (or found not guilty by reason of insanity etc.) and is in the process of serving a\ncustodial sentence, or is subject to a community order, or is subject to supervision following\nrelease from a custodial sentence, or is subject to a guardianship order following conviction,\nor is detained in a hospital following conviction or a finding of insanity or disability. The\nnotification requirement will also apply to offenders who would come within the categories\nset out in Clause 1 (3) but for the fact that, at the Bill's commencement, they are unlawfully\nat large or absent without leave, on temporary release or leave of absence, or on bail pending\nan appeal. \nA person who, at the time of the commencement of this part of the Bill, has already\ncompleted a sentence and is not subject to supervision, or has been released from hospital and\nis not subject to a guardianship order, will not, it would seem, be required to notify the police\nof his name and address under the terms of the Bill as currently drafted. Claims of\nretrospectivity would, of course, be likely to be made if the notification requirement were\nimposed on this category of offender.\nIn the consultation paper Sentencing and Supervision of Sex Offenders10, published in June\n1996 the Government discussed the question of potential retrospectivity. While noting that\narguments on both sides of this question were strong, the Government took the view that the\nimportant factor in determining the extent of the notification requirement should be the ease\nwith which offenders could be notified that they were subject to them. The paper states that:11\nIt is necessary to consider for how long the requirement to register should apply and whether it should apply\nto those convicted of any of the qualifying offences before the passage of the legislation. A separate question,\nif so, is how far back the obligation should extend.\nIf the requirement applied only to those convicted of a qualifying offence after the introduction of the\nrequirement, there would be no doubt as to whether the offender were aware of the requirement, as he could\nbe made aware of it at court. It follows that any failure to notify a subsequent change of address would be\nculpably negligent. However, without some element of retrospectiveness it could be some time before those who\nneeded to use the records could be confident that the addresses were up to date. In short, there might be no\nbenefit for many years. This would clearly be undesirable.\nAs the purpose of the requirement to register would be to provide better protection for the public which is\nneeded now, there therefore appears a strong argument for concluding that it should in some respects be\nretrospective. On the other hand, seeking to impose this proposed requirement retrospectively would create an\nobligation in respect of a past conviction for a sex offence which did not exist at the time of conviction. In\nprinciple, in all but the most exceptional circumstances, new laws speak only as to the future. Retrospectiveness\nruns contrary to this rule. It may also prove impossible to contact previously convicted sex offenders in order\nto inform them of the new requirement, and this would seriously reduce the effectiveness of the system. These\npractical objections do not apply to previously convicted sex offenders who have regular contact with the\ncriminal justice agencies, including those who are still in custody or under supervision in the community. It\n                                                                                                                                                 \n10 Cm 3304\n11 ibid paras 49-52\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nwould probably be possible in practical terms to extend the requirement to register to them.\nThe period for which notification requirements will remain in force in respect of particular\noffenders will depend on the sentence or order imposed on them. Clause 1(4) sets out the\napplicable periods as follows:\nDescription of person Applicable period\nA person who, in respect of the offence, An indefinite period\n is or has been sentenced to imprisonment\nfor life or for a term of 30 months or more\nA person who, in respect of the offence or An indefinite period\nfinding, is or has been admitted to a hospital\nsubject to a restriction order\nA person who, in respect of the offence, A period of 10 years beginning\nis or has been sentenced to imprisonment with the relevant date\nfor a term of more than 6 months but less\nthan 30 months\nA person who, in respect of the offence, A period of 7 years beginning\nis or has been sentenced to with that date \nimprisonment for a term of 6 months\nor less\nA person who, in respect of the offence or A period of 7 years beginning \nfinding, is or has been admitted to a hospital with that date\nwithout being subject to a restriction order\nA person of any other description A period of 5 years beginning\nwith that date\nBy virtue of Clause 4 the notification requirements will apply to young sex offenders serving\ncustodial sentences, or periods of detention under certain statutory provisions in England and\nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Where offenders who would otherwise be subject to\nnotification periods under Clause 1(4) of 10, 7 or 5 years respectively are under the age of\n18 on the relevant date Clause 4(2) is intended to provide that these periods should be halved.\nThe \"relevant date\" from which the notification period is to be measured in the case of both\nadult and young sex offenders is the date of conviction, the date of the finding of disability\nor the date of the caution, whichever is appropriate (Clause 1(8)).\n \nWhere a convicted offender has been sentenced to consecutive or partly concurrent terms of\nimprisonment in respect of two or more sexual offences to which the notification requirement\napplies, Clause 1 (5)-(6) seeks to provide that the applicable periods will have effect as if the\nperson were or had been sentenced, in respect of each of the offences, to a term of\nimprisonment which, in the case of consecutive terms, was equal to the aggregate of those\nterms, or in the case of concurrent terms, was equal to the aggregate of those terms after\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nmaking such deduction as might be necessary to secure that no period of time was counted\nmore than once. \nWhere a person is found to be under a disability but to have done the act charged against him\nin respect of a sexual offence and that person is subsequently tried for the offence, Clause\n1(7) provides that the finding of disability and any order made under it must be disregarded\nfor the purposes of the section. This provision may be intended to ensure that the period for\nwhich an offender is subject to the notification period following a finding of disability is not\ndeducted from the full period for which he or she may be subject to such a requirement\nfollowing conviction.\nClause 6(3) states that a reference to a person being \"under a disability and to have done the\nact charged against him\" includes a reference to his being or having been found:\na) unfit to be tried for such an offence;\nb) insane so that his trial for such an offence cannot or could not proceed; or\nc) unfit to be tried and to have done the act charged against him in respect of such an\noffence.\nUnder amendments to the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 brought in by the Criminal\nProcedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991, where a jury has determined that a\ndefendant in a criminal trial is under a disability which would constitute a bar to his being\ntried, a jury must then proceed to determine whether or not it is satisfied, on the basis of\nevidence already given and any additional evidence which may be adduced by the prosecution\nor a person appointed by the court to put the case for the defence, that the defendant did the\nact or made the omission charged against him. In trials at which the defendant has been\nfound to be under a disability since this provision was implemented on January 1 1992 the\ncourt will therefore generally have gone on to determine whether or not the defendant did the\nact charged. In these cases or those where the defendant has been found not guilty by reason\nof insanity, and the offence concerned is a sexual offence to which the notification\nrequirement will apply, the provisions of Clauses 1(1)(b), 1(2)(b) and 1(3)(d) seek to ensure\nthat the defendant will be subject to the notification requirement for the appropriate period.\nThe extension in Clause 6(3) of the definition of the expression \"under a disability and to\nhave done the act charged against him\" to cases where a person has been found unfit to be\ntried or insane so that his trial cannot or could not proceed, without reference, in these two\ncases, to findings as to whether or not the defendants did the acts charged, is intended to\nensure that the notification requirement can be applied to defendants who are still detained\nin hospital having originally been charged and ordered to be detained in hospital before the\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nimplementation of the 1991 Act12. \nD. Cautions\nThere has been some criticism of the extension of the registration requirement to offenders\nwho, after the commencement of Part 1 of the Bill, are cautioned by police constables rather\nthan being convicted or otherwise dealt with by courts. In a leading article on June 14 1996\nthe Daily Telegraph expressed the view that the inclusions of cautions on a national register\nof sex offenders would be unjustified, since cautions were not public information.13\nIn its briefing on the Bill Liberty suggests that, as cautions can be offered in informal\nsituations, individuals may consent to them without the benefit of legal advice or\nrepresentation. Liberty notes that cautions are non-statutory and that they are intended to act\nas a warning. It considers that if cautions are being used for offences serious enough to merit\nnotification they should not be, and goes on to suggest that attaching a sentencing and\npunitive function to them threatens to undermine their potential and amounts to an\nunreasonable extension of executive power and due process. Liberty also takes the view that\nif the extension of the registration requirement to cautions is enacted, it will not be in an\nindividual's interest to accept a caution, and there is likely to be a considerable rise in\nchallenges to cautioning decisions by way of applications for judicial review.\nIn the consultation paper Sentencing and Supervision of Sex Offenders the Government said\nthe registration requirement would probably best be targeted on those who were convicted of\nany sexual offence which was serious enough to attract the possibility of custody14. The\nGovernment added that there was evidence that the \"single offence\" sex offender was likely\nto be the exception and that many who were convicted of one offence might well have\ncommitted others in the past. It added that there was evidence that securing a conviction for\na sexual crime was very difficult15.\nE. Certification for the purposes of the notification requirement\nClause 5 is designed to enable courts, by or before which defendants are convicted of the\nrelevant sexual offences (or found not guilty by reason of insanity or found to be under a\ndisability and to have done the act charged) after the implementation of this Part of the Bill,\n                                                                                                                                                 \n12 Source: Home Office Mental Health and Criminal Cases Unit\n13 When inquiries are abused - Daily Telegraph 14.6.1996\n14 Cm 3304 para 46\n15 ibid. para 45\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nto state in open court that this has happened on the date in question, that the offence in\nquestion is a sexual offence to which this part of the bill applies, and to certify these facts,\nwhether at the time or subsequently. The certificate will be evidence or, in Scotland, sufficient\nevidence of those facts, for the purposes of the Bill's provisions concerning the notification\nrequirement.\nWhere a person is cautioned by a police constable in respect of a relevant sexual offence\nwhich the offender has admitted at the time the caution is given, and the constable informs\nthe offender that he has been cautioned on that date for a sexual offence to which the\nnotification requirement applies and certifies those facts in a form to be prescribed by the\nSecretary of State16 this certificate will also constitute evidence of these facts for the purposes\nof this Part of the Bill. The certification provisions in Clause 5 would seem to be intended,\namongst other things, to provide a means by which offenders may be made aware that the\nnotification requirement applies to them.\nF. Effect of the notification requirement\nUnder Clause 2, a person who is subject to the notification requirement will be required to\nnotify the police of certain information within 14 days of the date of the conviction, finding\nof disability or caution which gave rise to the requirement. The person concerned will have\nto notify any police station in writing or attend a police station and give an oral notification\nto a police officer or to any person authorised for the purpose by the officer in charge of the\nstation. A police will be required to provide written acknowledgment of the notification.\nUnder Clause 2(1) the person subject to the notification requirement will have to provide the\nfollowing information:\na) his name and where he also uses one or more other names, each of those names: and\nb) the address of his sole or main residence in the United Kingdom or, where he has no\nsuch residence, the address of premises in the United Kingdom which he regularly\nvisits.\n \nA person subject to the notification requirement will also have to inform the police within 14\ndays of his using a name which has not been notified to the police or of any change \"which\nhas the effect of falsifying\" information concerning the address of the person's sole or main\naddress in the UK or, if he has no such residence, the address of premises which he regularly\nvisits. The person will be required to notify the police of his new or additional name or names\nand of the effect of any change in the information concerning his address. \n                                                                                                                                                 \n16 In a statutory instrument subject to annulment under the negative procedure \n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nAny time when the person is remanded or committed to custody by a court, or is serving a\nsentence of imprisonment or a term of service detention, or is detained in a hospital, or is\noutside the UK, is to be disregarded for the purposes of determining whether initial or\nsubsequent notification has been made within 14 days (Clause 2(3)).\nUnder Clause 3 it will be an offence, punishable on summary conviction by up to one months'\nimprisonment and a £1,000 fine, for a person who is subject to the notification requirement\nto fail, without reasonable excuse, to notify the police as required by Clause 2, or to provide\ninformation under these provisions which the person knows to be false. Clause 3(2) is\nintended to enable proceedings for this offence to be commenced in any court having\njurisdiction in any place where the person charged with the offence resides or is found. \nThe Bill does not appear to provide specific guidance on the definition of premises which a\nperson \"regularly visits\" for the purposes of determining whether or not a person, who is\nsubject to the notification requirement but has no sole or main residence in the UK, has\nfulfilled his or her obligation. It is presumably intended that these words should be given their\nordinary, natural meaning, given the absence of specific provision to the contrary, and it is\nperhaps intended that this question be left to be worked out on a case by case basis. There\nmay, however, be an element of uncertainty about whether the notification requirements have\nbeen fulfilled, and consequently about whether or not the offence of non-compliance has\nbeen committed, in cases involving offenders who are either homeless or otherwise without\na sole or main residence in this country. The Home Office consultation paper Sentencing and\nSupervision of Sex Offenders made the following observations about offenders with\ntemporary addresses or no fixed abode17:\n58. Some of those convicted of designated\noffences requiring notification of changes of\naddress will not have a fixed address. One\npossibility is that they should be exempted from\nregistration until they had acquired a fixed\nresidence. The disadvantage with this suggestion is\nthat it could provide a loophole for those\ndetermined to avoid registration. In these\ncircumstances, we therefore propose that offenders\nshould be required to give an address in the locality\nthrough which they could be contacted. So, for\nexample, a person staying for a few nights at a time\nwith different friends around Manchester could\n(subject to agreement) give one of the friend's\naddress, his place of work, or the address of an\norganisation he visits frequently and regularly, as\nthe contact address. If, however, he moved to\nBirmingham, he would be required to give a new\ncontact address in that city.\n                                                                                                                                                 \n17 Cm 3304 p.11\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\n59. It is inevitable that the register would not be\nso comprehensive as to provide information on all\nthe places where a convicted offender may seek to\nreoffend. For example, an offender who lived in\nReading, and whose address was correctly\nregistered, might have widespread opportunities to\noffend elsewhere, particularly if his employment\ninvolved travel. Police in the areas he visited\nwould not be aware from the record of his presence\nin their force area even though it was entirely up to\ndate. With this in mind, and also conscious of the\nneed to reduce the burden on offenders and the\nbureaucratic burden on police, we propose that\ntemporary changes of address of less than four\nweeks would not need to be notified. This would\nallow an offender to spend a reasonable time away\nfrom his permanent address on holiday or visiting\nrelatives without notifying the police, so long as he\nreturned home within four weeks.\nIt could be argued that it may be easier to secure convictions for non-compliance with a\nnotification requirement than it would be for a sexual offence and that the creation of the new\noffence of non-compliance may increase the prospect of such offenders being apprehended\nand dealt with, although not for sexual offences themselves. Similar arguments have been put\nforward for the extension of the penalty of disqualification for driving to offences other than\ndriving offences.\nG. The mandatory nature of the notification requirement\nIn its briefing on the Sex Offenders Bill18, Liberty notes that a notification requirement could\nprove a valuable additional aspect of the courts' sentencing powers in dealing with certain\nconvicted sex offenders who may continue to pose some risk once released back into the\ncommunity. It takes the view, however, that for a registration scheme to be workable and to\nhave any merit it should be targeted to the offender, rather than to the offence. Liberty's view\nis therefore that a notification requirement should be an additional sentencing option available\nto judges. It is concerned that the Bill seeks to impose a blanket requirement based not only\non conviction but also on accepting a caution. Liberty notes that the Bill will require\nregistration regardless of the facts of the case or of the danger posed by the offender and\nsuggests that the list of offences which will carry a registration requirement is too broad to\nprevent injustice. Liberty is also concerned that the Bill does not provide for additional\nresources to be made available to the police to enable them to cope with the administrative\nburden of compiling and maintaining the register and suggests that this may reduce the\neffectiveness of the registration scheme.\n                                                                                                                                                 \n18 The Sex Offenders Bill: Liberty Briefing - January 1997 part 1\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nIn the consultation paper Sentencing and Supervision of Sex Offenders the Government made\nthe following observations about whether or not the imposition of a notification requirement\nshould be at the discretion of the sentencing court:19\n47. The requirement to register could either be\nautomatic on conviction for an appropriate offence,\nor could be at the discretion of the court. An\nelement of discretion would provide for the\nrequirement to be targeted more sharply on those\nwho appeared to represent the greatest potential\nthreat. However, discretion would risk excluding\nfrom the requirement those who may in fact\nreoffend. If the power were discretionary, the\ncourts might wish to call upon reports about the\noffender before deciding to make such an order.\nAny discretionary power would be subject to appeal\nto a higher court.\n48. A middle path may be possible, whereby\nregistration would be compulsory for those\nconvicted of serious offences, but would otherwise\nbe at the discretion of the court. If this approach\nwere adopted, it might be appropriate to define\n'serious offences\" by way of the sentence imposed,\nrather than the offence of which the person was\nconvicted. We consider that, under this\narrangement, automatic registration could apply to\nall those sentenced to 12 months or more.\nH. Further Comment\nThe proposal that people convicted of certain sexual offences be required to register their\nnames and addresses with the police has met with little criticism. As has already been\nmentioned, some commentators have, however been concerned about the proposed extension\nof the requirement to people who have been cautioned rather than convicted. The Daily\nTelegraph, for example, expressed the view that although it had reservations about \"strong-\narmed measures directed against the freedoms of the individual\" a national register of\nconvicted sex offenders would be a good thing. It added, however, that it did not consider the\ninclusion of cautions to be justified, as they were not public information.20\nSome commentators have questioned whether sex offenders are likely to comply with\nregistration requirements or be deterred from re-offending by them. An article in Police\nReview on July 19th 1996 referred to a study of registration in Washington State, USA,\nwhich apparently showed that only 70 % of offenders registered with the police, with the\nremaining 30% being those most likely to re-offend.21\nIn an article on \"Sex offender registration and community notification in the USA\" in the\nAutumn 1996 issue of Criminal Justice Matters Bill Hebenton and Terry Thomas note that\npart of the premise behind sex offender registration is that at any one time the police should\n                                                                                                                                                 \n19 Cm 3304 paras 47-48\n20 When inquiries are abused - Daily Telegraph 14.6.1996\n21 Registering sex offenders \"of little use\" - Police Review 19.7.1996\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nbe able to locate with some precision the known sex offenders living in their area. It is then\nargued that this in turn will aid the investigation of new sex crimes, act as a deterrent to those\non the register and assist other agencies offering treatment programmes. On this basis,\nidentifying the location of a perceived risk or threat to the community posed by a known sex\noffender can be seen as the first step to assessing and managing that risk or threat. As\nHebenton and Thomas go on to observe, critics may point out that registration has its\nlimitations as an aid to policing. They note that an offender may travel out of the local police\narea to avoid detection. An unregistered person may commit a crime and the police waste\nhours checking the register while the trail leading to the offender \"goes cold.\" At worst, they\nsay, registers will only serve to help \"round up the usual suspects\" who will be continually\nharassed and prevented from living a normal life.\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nII Sexual Offences Committed Outside the United\nKingdom\nA. Background\nGenerally speaking, the jurisdiction of the UK criminal courts is territorial and is thus\nrestricted to offences committed here, whether by UK citizens or citizens of other countries.\nThe courts do not have general jurisdiction over British nationals abroad, although there are\nsome notable exceptions, such as British nationals who commit murder abroad, who may be\ntried here. Where British nationals are alleged to have committed crimes abroad the preferred\noption is to extradite them to the country in which the crime is alleged to have taken place,\nrather than try to locate and bring in all the possible witnesses and evidence for a trial here.\nSome other countries, such as Germany, for example, are unable to extradite their own\nnationals because there are constitutional prohibitions on such a course of action or for other\nreasons. These countries therefore need to rely on their courts being able to invoke more\ncomprehensive extra-territorial jurisdiction in criminal matters.\nIn recent years there have been calls for the jurisdiction of the criminal courts in the UK to\nbe extended to permit the trial in this country of people from the UK who commit acts with\nchildren while overseas which would amount to sexual offences if committed in this country.\nThe Government was initially reluctant to extend the jurisdiction of the UK courts in this\nway. It set out its position on the matter in a number of Written Answers. For example, in\na Written Answer of 11 February 1994 the Home Office minister, David Maclean, said22:\nThe Government deplore sexual offences against children wherever they occur. Our own\nlaw against such abuse is rightly severe. However, our courts' jurisdiction is territorially\nbased rather than nationally based; and we have no plans to extend their jurisdiction over\npaedophile offences committed by British citizens abroad. We believe that such\njurisdiction would be largely unenforceable in practice and that where such offences have\nbeen committed abroad it is right for the country concerned to enforce its own law.\nUnlike some countries which do claim a wide extra-territorial criminal jurisdiction over\ntheir nationals, the United Kingdom is willing to extradite its own nationals to stand trial\nfor these offences abroad, subject to the usual safeguards. We are also willing to give\nlegal assistance to other countries under the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation)\nAct 1990.\nOn February 7th 1995, Lord Hylton introduced a Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill in the\nHouse of Lords which was intended to extend the jurisdiction of United Kingdom courts to\ntry sexual offences against children committed overseas. The Bill, which was not supported\nby the Government, completed all its Lords stages and was introduced into the Commons on\n                                                                                                                                                 \n22 HC Deb Vol 237 c.532W 11.2.1994\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nMay 3rd 1995, but did not progress any further.\nOn 12 July 1995 the Home Secretary announced the Government's plans for dealing with sex\ntourism. He said:23\nThe Government share the abhorrence felt by the vast majority of people about the sexual\nexploitation abroad of young children. The introduction, by Lord Hylton, of his Sexual\nOffences (Amendment) Bill has done much to highlight the issue and we have listened very\ncarefully to all that has been said both inside Parliament and more generally. We are\nanxious that effective action should be taken to deal with this problem. That must involve\naction by the foreign governments concerned, but that alone is not enough. We must also\ndo all that we can.\nDespite its admirable aim, Lord Hylton's Bill is, in the Government's view, seriously flawed\nand does not provide a workable or effective solution to the problems posed by sex\ntourism. The Government cannot therefore support it. \nWe are, however, urgently examining the scope of the law in each of the United Kingdom\njurisdictions to see what steps could be taken to deal with those who, in this country,\nconspire or incite others to commit offences abroad. This would enable us to deal with\nthose who organise sex tours or encourage others to travel abroad for the purpose of\nsexually exploiting children.\nAny legislation which might be brought forward to achieve this aim would need careful\nthought to ensure that it would be effective. We would hope to have proposals for\nlegislation ready as soon as the details can be satisfactorily resolved.\nOn December 8th 1995 the Government announced proposals for additional measures\ndesigned to deal with the problem of sex tourism through an extension of the law on\nconspiracy and incitement. The intention behind the new provisions was to facilitate the\nprosecution of those who organise tours abroad to commit sexual offences against children\nand encourage others to travel abroad for the purposes of sexually exploiting children. 24\n \nThe Sexual Offences (Conspiracy and Incitement) Bill 1995/96, a Private Member's Bill\ndesigned to implement the Government's proposals, was introduced by John Marshall on\nDecember 13th 1995 and had its Second Reading in the House of Commons on February 2nd\n1996.25 The Bill, which is now the Sexual Offences (Conspiracy and Incitement) Act 1996,\nextends to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and came into force on October\n1st 1996. The Act sets out an offence of conspiring to commit certain sexual acts abroad\nagainst children or inciting a person to commit certain acts against children where these acts\nwould, if committed in the UK, amount to one of a number of specified sexual offences. The\n                                                                                                                                                 \n23 HC Deb Vol 263 c.600 (W) 12.7.1995\n24\n\"New measures to stamp out sex tourism\" - Home Office 8.12.1995; HC Deb Vol 268\nc.451-2 (W) 8.12 1995\n25 HC Deb Vol 270 c.1225-1267 2.2.1996\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nsexual acts must be considered to be criminal offences in the place where they are alleged to\nhave been committed. Government-supported amendments introduced during the legislation's\nreport stage in the House of Commons provide that any act of incitement by means of a\nmessage (however communicated) is to be treated as done in England and Wales, or Scotland\nif the message is sent or received in England and Wales or Scotland. (For the purposes of the\nAct, \"England and Wales\" includes Northern Ireland.) In the course of the debate on these\namendments the Home Office minister Mr Maclean said that they were intended to extend\nthe scope of incitement to ensure that incitement by means of a telephone call, fax, Internet\nmessage or any other modern form of communication is deemed to take place in this country\nif it is received in this country.26\nSome commentators suggested that the Act should have gone further and extended the\njurisdiction of the UK courts to enable them to try people accused of sexual offences\ncommitted overseas. On December 5th 1995 Lord Hylton re-introduced his Sexual Offences\n(Amendment) Bill, which was intended to enable the courts to do this. The Bill completed its\npassage through the House of Lords and was introduced in the House of Commons, but it did\nnot have Government support and did not complete its passage through Parliament before the\nend of the session.\nOn February 1st 1996, the eve of the Second Reading of John Marshall's Bill which became\nthe 1996 Act, the Government announced an interdepartmental review of the extra-territorial\njurisdiction of the UK courts. The review was not only concerned with sex tourism, but\nincluded discussion of other serious crimes, such as violent assault and offences committed\naboard aircraft travelling to this country. The Home Office Press Notice announcing the\nreview stressed the Government's view that the countries in which child sex tourism is rife\nshould step up their efforts to deal with the problem and enforce their own laws. It reported\nthe Home Office minister David Maclean as saying;27\nThis is not an attempt to export British laws worldwide. The review is\nlooking at situations in which British nationals or residents commit crimes\nabroad which are offences both here and in the country concerned. And I\ndo not want to raise expectations that change will necessarily follow this\nreview. The practical difficulties of taking extra-territorial jurisdiction will\nnot be easy to overcome. A prosecution is generally best pursued in the\nterritory in which the crime is alleged to have been committed. It would be\ndangerous for us to give our courts jurisdiction as a token gesture. We\nmight be left in a situation in which we could not prosecute here because we\ncould not get the evidence to convict and we could not extradite because the\ntourist-receiving countries had washed their hands of the matter. We prefer\nto help those countries to face up to the problems in their own backyard.\n                                                                                                                                                 \n26 HC Deb Vol.275 c.953-4 19.4.1996\n27\n\"Review of extra-territorial jurisdiction announced\" Home Office Press Notice 1.2.1996\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nThe Press Notice referred to some of the potential practical problems of extra-territorial\njurisdiction as follows:\n- British police have no powers to investigate crimes or gather evidence in\nother countries;\n- British courts require witnesses to give evidence and be cross-examined in\nperson, but would not be able to compel the attendance of foreign witnesses;\nand\n- if the authorities in the place where an offence is alleged to have been\ncommitted are unwilling, or are unable to come up with sufficient evidence,\nto bring proceedings, our authorities would have great difficulty in carrying\nout a successful investigation.\nIn his speech during the Second Reading debate on Mr Marshall's Bill the Home Office\nminister David Maclean set out in some detail the Government's view of the advantages and\ndisadvantages of extending the courts' extra-territorial jurisdiction, including practical\ndifficulties and potential problems with the law of evidence.28 Similar issues were raised\nduring the debate on the Bill's report stage and third reading in the House of Commons.29\nDuring the debate on Third Reading Mr Maclean re-iterated the Government's view that only\neffective action by the tourist-receiving countries would make a difference on the ground and\nimprove the lives of the children who are subjected to abuse by paedophile tourists. He\nadded that:30\nI am encouraged by some of the steps that have been taken by the\nPhilippines, for example, to crack down on sex tourists. I am puzzled by\nthose who act as apologists for the inaction by tourist-receiving countries\nwhen they say that those countries cannot be seen to prosecute western\ntourists because of the harm that it will do to their tourist trade. Therefore\nthey must pass the buck back to western countries to do something. Of\ncourse those countries will attract the scum of the earth if they fail to purge\ntheir sleazy child brothels. I suggest that their tourist trade might expand if\nfamilies and decent people felt able to visit such places, free from the fear\neither of being thought a pervert or of having to consort with them. My\nmessage to those countries is, \"Prosecute those scum and see your\ninternational standing rise.\" Soho was cleaned up by taking action there, not\nby exhorting people in foreign countries not to come to London.\nIn a Press Notice issued by the Home Office on July 23rd 1996, the Government announced\nthat its inter-departmental review of extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of criminal offences\nhad been completed. The Press Notice added that the Government had accepted the review's\n                                                                                                                                                 \n28 HC Deb Vol 270 c.1249-1254 2.2.1996\n29 HC Deb Vol 275 c.945-998 19.4.1996\n30 HC Deb Vol 275 c.996 19.4.1996\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nrecommendation that decisions on extending jurisdiction should be based on the following six\nguidelines:\na) The offence would have to be serious;\nb) Witnesses and evidence needed for a prosecution are likely to be\navailable in this country;\nc) There is international agreement that certain conduct is reprehensible and\nconcerted action is needed;\nd) Action is needed because of the vulnerability of the victim;\ne) It is in the interests of the standing and reputation of the UK in the\ninternational community;\nf) There is danger that no action would be taken to deal with the offences\nThe press notice added that:\nMeeting any of the guidelines would not necessarily mean that wider jurisdiction would be\ntaken over a particular offence, but it would establish whether there was a \"prima facie\" case -\nthat is the case merited further consideration with a view to legislating to extend the\njurisdiction of the courts. \nThe Press Notice also announced that legislation to provide new powers to prosecute child\nmolesters who commit offences abroad and people who, while in this country, conspire with\nor incite others to commit offences abroad, would be introduced at the earliest opportunity.\nThe Jurisdiction (Conspiracy and Incitement) Bill31, which was introduced by Nigel Waterson\non November 11 1996, is supported by the Government and is due to be debated on Second\nReading on January 31 1997, is designed to extend the courts' jurisdiction over people in this\ncountry who conspire with or incite others to commit offences abroad. Measures designed to\nenable the courts in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to prosecute people\nwho commit certain sexual offences while outside the United Kingdom are set out in Part II\nof the Sexual Offenders Bill.32\nB. Part II of the Sex Offenders Bill\nClause 7 of the Bill seeks to give the courts in England and Wales and Northern Ireland\njurisdiction over acts done, by persons in countries or territories outside the United Kingdom,\nwhich constitute offences under the laws in force in those countries or territories (in that they\n                                                                                                                                                 \n31 Bill 19 of 1996-97\n32 Bill 66 of 1996-97\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nare punishable under the law in force in that country or territory, however they may be\ndescribed in that law) and would have constituted one of the sexual offences to which the\nClause applies if they had been done in England and Wales or Northern Ireland. Clause 8 is\ndesigned to give similar jurisdiction to the courts in Scotland by inserting a new section 16B\ninto the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995.\nOnly those people who are British citizens or residents in the United Kingdom at the time\nwhen Clauses 7 and 8 are implemented, or who subsequently become British citizens or\nbecome resident in the United Kingdom, will be liable to prosecution under these\narrangements. Foreign nationals who are not resident in the UK when these Clauses are\nimplemented and do not subsequently become resident here will not, therefore be triable in\nthe UK criminal courts under these provisions. \nClauses 7 and 8 seek to provide that the condition, that an act constitute an offence under the\nlaw in force in another country, be taken to be satisfied unless, within a period of time to be\ndetermined by rules of court in England and Wales and Northern Ireland (or an Act of\nAdjournal in Scotland) the defence serves on the prosecution a notice stating the defence's\nview that the condition is not satisfied, showing its grounds for that view and requiring the\nprosecution to show that it is satisfied. The courts will have discretionary powers to dispense\nwith this prior notice requirement if they see fit. In the Crown Court in England and Wales\nand the courts in Scotland the question whether the condition, that an act done by a person\nmust constitute an offence under the law in the country or territory where it took place, has\nbeen satisfied in a particular case will be for the judge alone.\nThe offences in respect of which it is intended that the courts in England and Wales, Northern\nIreland and Scotland should have extra-territorial jurisdiction under Part II of the Bill are set\nout in Schedule 2 and Clause 8 and summarised in Appendix II to this paper. In all three of\nthese UK jurisdictions the age of consent for homosexual acts is 18, having been lowered\nfrom 21 by Section 145 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Liability for\nprosecution under the provisions of Part II of the Sex Offenders Bill for homosexual offences\ncommitted abroad will, however, be restricted to acts where the other party is under the age\nof 16. Some commentators may argue that this provides support for the argument that the age\nof consent for homosexual acts should be lowered to 16, which is the age of consent for\nheterosexual acts other than heterosexual buggery.\nThe proposals to extend the jurisdiction of the UK courts to cover sexual offences against\nchildren committed by British citizens and UK residents abroad have generally been accepted\nor welcomed. In its briefing on the Sex Offenders Bill Liberty says that while it understands\nthe sentiment behind the provisions in Part II of the Bill, it doubts whether the measures are\nworkable. It considers it improbable that a defendant under such circumstances would receive\na fair trial, particularly if he or she lacked the resources to bring defence witnesses to the UK\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nor such witnesses refused to travel here.33 \n                                                                                                                                                 \n33 The Sex Offenders Bill: Liberty Briefing January 1997\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nIn a report on Action against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, published by\nthe Home Office in August 1996, the Government set out its decision to extend the\njurisdiction of the UK courts to allow trials in the UK of those who commit child abuse\nabroad. It added:\nHowever, the Government recognises the considerable practical difficulties\ninvolved in gathering sufficient evidence and witnesses from abroad to\nmount a satisfactory prosecution in the UK courts - and for this reason\ncontinues to regard extradition to the country where the offence was\ncommitted as the best means of bringing offenders (even its own nationals)\nto trial.\nThe report went on to describe the current arrangements for assisting foreign countries who\nwish to take action against British tourists for committing sexual offences against children.34\n                                                                                                                                                 \n34 Action against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children: A Report by the\nGovernment of the United Kingdom Home Office August 1996 p.11-12\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nIII Other Matters Relating to Sex Offenders\nThe Crime (Sentences) Bill35, which has just completed its passage through the House of\nCommons and been passed to the House of Lords, contains provisions designed to implement\nproposals for the sentencing and supervision of sex offenders in England and Wales which\nwere set out in the White Paper Protecting the Public36 and the Home Office consultation\ndocument Sentencing and Supervision of Sex Offenders.37 These proposals are considered in\nLibrary Research Paper 96/99 on The Crime (Sentences) Bill. The Crime and Punishment\n(Scotland) Bill38, which has just completed its passage through the House of Commons,\ncontains provisions relating to the sentencing and supervision on release of offenders in\nScotland. Provisions in both of these Bills on the treatment of mentally disordered offenders\nare considered in Library Research Paper 96/100 on The Crime (Sentences) Bill and the Crime\nand Punishment (Scotland) Bill: provisions for mentally disordered offenders. The proposal,\nin the consultation paper Sentencing and Supervision of Sex Offenders, to make it an offence\nfor a convicted sex offender to seek employment involving access to children,39 is shortly to\nbe the subject of further consultation by the Home Office. \nA. Access to information about sex offenders\nIn the White Paper On the Record, published in June 1996, the Government set out the\ncurrent arrangements for access to criminal records for employment and other related\npurposes, and some of the problems arising from these arrangements40:\n3. At present police forces conduct, free of\ncharge and at the request of prospective employers,\ncriminal record checks on a limited range of\noccupations. Those working with children form the\nlargest group for which checks are undertaken.\nOver 600,000 such checks were made in the year to\n31 March 1995. Several hundred thousand\nadditional checks are made annually on other\ngroups including taxi and minicab drivers,\nmanagers of residential homes and claimants for\ncriminal injuries compensation. There have been\nmany calls for checks to be made more widely\navailable. But carrying them out is often a\nmanpower-intensive activity, diverting police\nresources from other vital tasks. As a result it has\nnot been possible, up to now, to reach agreement\non the extension of criminal record checks to any\nnew groups.\n4. At the moment there is no completely\ncomprehensive collection of criminal records for the\nwhole country. The national collection is held on\nmicrofiche at the National Identification Service\n(formerly the National Identification Bureau) at\nNew Scotland Yard. It consists of records of\nindividuals who have committed \"reportable\"\n                                                                                                                                                 \n35 Bill 3 of 1996-97\n36 Cm 3190 March 1996\n37 Cm 3304 June 1996\n38 Bill 5 of 1996-97\n39 Cm 3304 paras 68-77 \n40 Cm 3308 p.4-5\n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\noffences (ie those for which the offender could be\nimprisoned), plus a small number of non-reportable\noffences. The computerisation of this collection is\nunder way but is not yet complete (see paragraph\n11 below).\n5. Details of non-reportable convictions and\ncautions, together with some information relating to\nsuspected offences for which there has been no\nconviction (\"non-conviction\" information), are held\nby the police force which dealt with the matter. So\nany fully comprehensive crimincheck must be\ncarried out at both national and local force level.\n6. At present, those categories subject to checking\nare not the same as the categories which are\nexceptions to the provisions of the Rehabilitation of\nOffenders Act 1974 (ROA), although there is\nconsiderable overlap between the two groups. This\nmeans that although, for example, most people\nworking with children are both exceptions to the\nprovisions of the Act and subject to checking, a\nnumber of professions such as solicitors and\ndoctors are exceptions to the provisions of the Act\nbut not subject to checking, and some groups\nsubject to checking - such as taxi and minicab\ndrivers - are not exceptions to the provisions of the\nAct. This situation is hard to defend in principle\nand often causes misunderstanding and confusion in\npractice.\n7. The present system, in which criminal record\nchecks are only available to employers for certain\ntypes of staff, has led to an abuse of the subject\naccess rights available to individuals under the Data\nProtection Act 1984 (DPA). Under the Act\nindividuals can apply for a copy of information\nheld about them on police computerised records.\nProspective employers and others (such as overseas\nGovernments who require information about\ncriminal convictions from prospective immigrants)\nwho have an interest in establishing whether\nindividuals have a criminal record often require\nthem to make an application for information under\nthe DPA. This practice, known as 'enforced subject\naccess\", is unsatisfactory because it elicits both\nspent and unspent convictions, which clearly\nundermines the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act.\nThe White Paper contained proposals for three new procedures for checking a person's\ncriminal record, depending on the circumstances in which the information was requested.\nSimilar proposals for Scotland were set out in a Scottish Office consultation document On the\nRecord in Scotland, published in June 199641. These proposals are now set out in Part V of\nthe Police Bill, which was introduced in the House of Lords, where it is still being\nconsidered. In her speech opening the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill the Home\nOffice minister, Baroness Blatch, summarised the Government's intentions in relation to Part\nV, which extends to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, as follows:42\nA new criminal records agency will be\nestablished as part of the Home Office to undertake\nthis work for England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn Scotland the work will be undertaken by the\nScottish Criminal Record Office. Individuals will\nbe able to obtain information about their criminal\nrecords. In carefully defined circumstances and\nwith the consent of the individual, this will also be\nprovided to those bodies which are registered with\nthe agency which will include employers, licensing\nbodies and voluntary organisations.\n                                                                                                                                                 \n41 UC 31 1995-96\n42 HL Deb Vol 575 c.794-795 11.11.1996\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nThe Bill proposes three types of certificate. The\nfirst, a criminal conviction certificate, will be issued\nonly to individuals. It will state whether they have\nconvictions recorded in central police records which\nare not spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders\nAct.\nThe second certificate, a criminal record\ncertificate described as a \"full\" check in the White\nPaper, will be available for occupations which are\nexceptions to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act.\nA joint application will be made by the individual\nand organisation which is seeking the check.\nInformation will be provided from central police\nrecords about spent and un-spent convictions and\nabout cautions.\nThe third certificate, an enhanced criminal\nrecord certificate described as an \"enhanced\" check\nin the White Paper, will be restricted to those\nworking on a regular, unsupervised basis with\nchildren; for certain licensing purposes; and, prior\nto appointment, judges and magistrates. An\nenhanced certificate will include the information\ncontained in a criminal record certificate, plus\ninformation from local police records. Where\nrelevant, non-conviction information might be\nsupplied. Very exceptionally this could be\nprovided to the employer but not the individual.\nThis would only happen where the information\nmight prejudice an ongoing or future investigation.\nWe expect individuals to meet the cost of the\nchecks although employers or others could\nreimburse them if they wished to do so. The cost of\ncriminal conviction certificates and criminal record\ncertificates is estimated at about £5 or £6. An\nenhanced criminal record certificate would cost\nabout £8 to £10.\nBodies eligible to receive criminal record or\nenhanced criminal record certificates must register\nwith the agency. A registration fee will be payable\nwhich we expect to be about £15 to £20. A\ncondition of registration is that organisations should\nfollow a code of practice. We will shortly be\npublishing responses to the consultation exercise\nwhich was undertaken on the draft code. Some of\nthe responses have already led directly to the\ninclusion of provisions within the Bill but some\nfurther consultation will be required with interested\nparties before the code can be finalised.\nWe recognise that there are important civil\nliberties issues connected with criminal record\nchecks. What we have tried to do is to strike a\nbalance between the need to protect vulnerable\nmembers of society, particularly children, while\navoiding the need for intrusive checks. That is\nparticularly so when we come to information which\nhas not been tested before the courts. That is why\nwe have felt it important to restrict the use of non-\nconviction information to situations where children\nmight be at risk because those working with them\nwill be in a position which gives them regular and\nunsupervised contact and for various statutory\nlicensing purposes where it is important to guard\nagainst fraud or where the information is necessary\nfor probity in the administration of justice.\nThe proposed new arrangements for criminal record checks, which have caused some\ncontroversy, are to be implemented by a criminal records agency which is intended to be self-\nfinancing. Charges are therefore to be made for certificates issued. On current estimates the\nfee for a criminal conviction certificate or criminal record certificate will be £5 or £6, while\nthe fee for an enhanced criminal record certificate will be between £8 and £10. Concern has\nbeen expressed by voluntary organisations, groups representing child-minders and others about\nthe impact on their members and on volunteers of the cost of acquiring the various levels of\ncertificate. During the Bill's committee stage in the House of Lords Lord Weatherill\nsuccessfully moved amendments designed to exempt applicants for voluntary positions from\nhaving to pay the prescribed fees for criminal conviction certificates, criminal record\ncertificates or enhanced criminal record certificates under Clauses 100,101 and 102 of the Bill\n29\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nas originally drafted43. He was concerned about the effect which the need to pay fees would\nhave on organisations which depended on the services of a large number of volunteers.\nIn unsuccessfully opposing Lord Weatherill's amendment, the Home Office minister Baroness\nBlatch described some of the practical difficulties which the Government felt would arise if\nfree or subsidised checks were made available to certain categories of applicants. She set out\nthe Government's view that an even spread and a modest fee for criminal record information\nwhich would enhance the effectiveness of the voluntary sector and make vulnerable groups\nsafer in the community was the fairest way forward, as this would not then become an\nunreasonable burden on individuals and/or taxpayers.44 An amendment to exempt child-\nminders from the requirement to pay fees for criminal record checks was introduced, and\nsubsequently withdrawn, by the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank during\nthe report stage of the Police Bill in the House of Lords.45 \nUnder Clause 109 of the Police Bill it will be an offence for a person to make a false\ncertificate, alter a certificate, use another person's certificate in a way which suggests that it\nrelates to himself or allow a certificate relating to him to be used by another person in a way\nwhich suggests that it relates to that other person. It will also be an offence for a person\nknowingly to make a false statement for the purpose of obtaining or enabling another person\nto obtain a certificate. These offences will be punishable on summary conviction by up to six\nmonths' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine, or both.\nClause 109 of the Police Bill also creates offences relating to the unauthorised disclosure of\ninformation provided under the provisions concerning criminal record certificates and\nenhanced criminal record certificates. These offences will be punishable on summary\nconviction by up to six months' imprisonment and a £1,000 fine or both. It is intended that\ncriminal conviction certificates should only be issued to the individual concerned. Where an\nindividual requests a criminal record certificate or an enhanced criminal record certificate in\nthe prescribed form countersigned by a body registered under Clause 107 of the Bill, a copy\nof the certificate issued to the individual will be sent to the registered body, and in the case\nof the enhanced criminal record certificate certain additional, confidential information which\nis considered to be relevant may be provided to the registered body alone. There is, however\nno further provision in the Police Bill for wider public access to criminal records.\nOther sources of information relating to the suitability of applicants for posts involving access\nto children are described in the consultation document Sentencing and Supervision of Sex\nOffenders as follows46: \n                                                                                                                                                 \n43 HL Deb Vol 576 c.469-492 2.12.1996\n44 ibid. c.482-486 \n45 HL Deb Vol 577 c.534-538 20.1.1997\n46 Cm 3304 paras 65-67\n30\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\n65. The Department of Health operate, on an\nadvisory basis, a consultancy service, which applies\nto England and Wales, whereby local authorities,\nand private and voluntary organisations can check\nthe suitability of those they propose to employ in a\nchildcare post. The service:\n notes convictions against those who (at the time\nof conviction) are or were in child casework; it\nalso notes the names of persons formerly in\nsuch work who have been dismissed or who\nhave resigned in certain circumstances;\n at the request of employers, provides a check\nagainst these records in respect of individuals\nseeking work in a childcare post; and\n alerts employers if the check is positive.\nThe object is to make sure that, as far as possible,\nunsuitable people are not appointed to positions\ninvolving contact with children or responsibility for\nthem. The type of jobs covered are those where\nthe person would have substantial unsupervised\naccess to children.\n66. The Secretary of State for Education and\nEmployment has power to bar a person from\nemployment by a local education authority, school\nor further education establishment as a teacher or in\nany other capacity that would involve regular\ncontact with children or young people up to 18\nyears of age. She may bar people on grounds of\nmisconduct, or on medical grounds. Anyone\nconvicted after 31 October 1995 of a sexual offence\nagainst a child under 16 years of age is barred\nautomatically. Barred persons may apply to the\nSecretary of State to have the bar removed on the\nbasis of new evidence, or evidence of a significant\nchange in circumstance.\n67. The Department for Education and\nEmployment maintain a list of barred persons,\nknown as List 99, which employers within the\neducation service must check to ensure that they do\nnot appoint someone who is barred. People are\nbarred by the Secretary of State for a variety of\nreasons. List 99 is not a list of sex offenders; nor\nis everyone on the list perceived to be a danger to\nchildren.\nB. Public notification of the addresses of sex offenders.\nIn the United States, where, as has already been mentioned, sex offender registration schemes\nare common and no longer appear to be controversial, a further development has arisen in the\nform of community notification schemes. In their article in the Autumn 1996 issue of\nCriminal Justice Matters Bill Hebenton and Terry Thomas note that some sex offender\nregistration schemes have been made accessible to the public in certain circumstances and that\nfive states have gone further by pro-actively notifying the public when a sex offender has\ncome to live in their area. They add that notification exists in Louisiana, Alaska, Tennessee,\nWashington and New Jersey, and that other states are reported to be interested. Notification\nhere involves informing people in a given locality of the whereabouts and details of sex\noffenders living near them by sending out \"flyers\" with an offender's photograph and address\nor using the local press or television channels. In some cases information on these matters is\nalso available on the Internet. Hebenton and Thomas note that:\nLawyers, and the American Civil Liberties Union have argued that\nnotification is an invasion of privacy and a \"cruel and unusual\" form of\npunishment which is therefore unconstitutional. While the matter has not yet\nbeen tested at Supreme Court level, at state level both arguments have been\nlost in favour of the protection of society argument and the argument that\n31\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nnotification is a form of civil \"regulation\" rather than punishment.\nIn the consultation document Sentencing and Supervision of Sex Offenders the Government\nmade the following remarks about wider public access to information from the criminal\nrecords database:47\n62. Although the idea of a requirement to\nregister changes of address so that the criminal\nrecords database can be kept more up to date\nparticularly addresses the needs of police, there is\na wider interest in this information. Those\nresponsible for working with children may wish to\nobtain criminal record information about applicants\nfor voluntary or paid positions. The Government\nwould wish to allow access to this information for\nthose who wished to use it for the purpose of\nprotecting children, so far as this is feasible,\nalthough the danger of misidentification is such that\nthe criminal records should be accessed only by the\npolice and a very limited number of other agencies.\nEven on the basis of police providing information\nabout criminal records, we would not wish to see\n unrestricted availability. Unrestricted availability\nof criminal records information could have a\nnumber of undesirable outcomes: the register could\nbe used by those who wished unlawfully to harass\nthose on it; it could be used to locate victims (there\nis some evidence of this having occurred in\njurisdictions without controls on information about\noffenders); and it could be used by sex offenders as\na means of networking. As a central register held\non the Phoenix database of the police national\ncomputer, it would not be open directly to any\nperson or organisation other than the police and the\nbodies with whom access agreements have been\nmade.\nThe Government is currently consulting with the Association of Chief Police Officers about\npresent police practice concerning the disclosure of information on sex offenders and how\nsuch information might be disclosed in future. Civil liberties groups and some commentators\nhave expressed fears about the potential which public notification schemes might have to\nencourage vigilantism and have pointed to cases in this country in which known sex offenders\nhave been forced to leave their homes after information about them was made available. The\nmurder of one sex offender in Scotland was also reported as having been linked to local\nknowledge of his record of sex offences.\nC. Lord Cullen's recommendations\nIn his report on The Public Inquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13\nMarch 1996, published in October 1996, Lord Cullen recommended that there should be a\nsystem for the accreditation to a national body of clubs and groups voluntarily attended by\nchildren and young persons under 16 years of age for their recreation, education or\ndevelopment, the main purpose of which would be to ensure that there were adequate checks\non the suitability of the leaders and workers who had substantial unsupervised access to\nthem48. In its reply, the Government referred to the changes in arrangements for the disclosure\n                                                                                                                                                 \n47 Cm 3304 p. 12 para 62\n48 Cm 3386 p. 150 para 27 \n32\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nof criminal records set out in the Scottish Office consultation document On the Record in\nScotland, which are now set out in the Police Bill. The Government added that it would\nconsult immediately with all interested parties in Scotland on the proposals for the\nestablishment of arrangements for a national information and accreditation system and that\nthere would be parallel consultations in England and Wales49.\nLord Cullen also recommended that consideration be given to the development of a Scottish\nVocational Qualification in respect of work with children, including the organisation of clubs\nand child development and protection50. The Government accepted this recommendation and\nsaid it was inviting the Scottish Vocational Education Council urgently to bring forward\nproposals for a qualification as recommended51.\n                                                                                                                                                 \n49 Cm 3392 October 1996 p.7\n50 Cm 3386 p.150 para 28\n51 Cm 3392 p.7\n33\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/11\nAppendix I\nOffences to which the notification requirement will apply\nSex Offenders Bill Schedule 1\nOffences in England and Wales\n1.-(1) This Part of this Act applies to the following sexual offences under\nthe law of England and Wales, namely-\n(a)offences under the following provisions of the Sexual Offences Act\n1956-\n(i) section I (rape);\n(ii) section 5 (intercourse with a girl under 13);\n(iii) section 6 (intercourse with a girl between 13 and 16);\n(iv) section 10 (incest by a man);\n(v) section 12 (buggery);\n(vi) section 13 (indecency between men);\n(vii) section 14 (indecent assault on a woman);\n(viii) section 15 (indecent assault on a man);\n(ix) section 16 (assault with intent to commit buggery);\n(x) section 28 (causing or encouraging prostitution of,\nintercourse with, or indecent assault on, girl under 16);\n(b) an offence under section 1(1) of the Indecency with Children Act\n1960 (indecent conduct towards young child);\n(c) an offence under section 54 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 (inciting\ngirl under 16 to have incestuous sexual intercourse);\n(d) an offence under section I of the Protection of Children Act 1978\n(indecent photographs of children);

Summary\nCurrently, people who receive social security benefits after an accident or disease can find\nthat an amount is recovered by the DSS from a subsequent damages award. The aim of this\nis to prevent people being compensated twice, through both the benefits system and a\ndamages award. Awards under £2,500 are not subject to recovery.\nPeter Lilley, Secretary of State for Social Security, announced his intention to reform the\nscheme for compensation recovery on 9 October 19961. This followed a Social Security\nSelect Committee report2 after an enquiry into the operation of the scheme and consultation\nby the DSS on how the suggested reforms might be implemented.\nThe Bill redrafts and amends Part IV of the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\nIn brief the changes will:\n• enable victims of personal injury or disease who have been receiving social security\nbenefits to keep their damages for pain and suffering. Previously all damages could be\nsubject to recovery to recoup social security benefits paid;\n• remove the £2,500 ceiling below which compensation recovery does not currently take\nplace.\nThe Government intends the provisions will come into force for settlements made after\nOctober 1997. It anticipates the provisions in the Bill will lead to net public expenditure\nsavings of £50 million3.\nThe Bill was introduced in the House of Lords and received its second reading there on\n19 November 1996 and completed its Report stage on 21 January 1997.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 Department of Social Security press notice Peter Lilley announces reform of compensation recovery scheme,\n96/197.\n2 Compensation Recovery, Fourth Report of the Social Security Committee HC 196 1994/5, 21 June 1995\n3 Department of Social Security Press Notice 241, 8 Nov 1996. (The projected saving of £50 million is\nrevised from the previous estimate of £40 million in press notice 96/197)\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nB. Introduction\nA person who has been incapacitated by accident or disease may be entitled to social security\nbenefits. If that injury or disease was caused by negligence of a third party they may also\nbe entitled to compensation from that third party. In practice this compensation is usually\npaid by insurance companies after a settlement between the parties or enforced through the\ncourts. It is a long established principle that the benefits which are paid to the 'victim' do not\nserve as double compensation for the same loss but should simply meet their needs while a\nsettlement is being reached4. Prior to 1989, courts were instructed to take into account the\nvalue of benefits received, and the amount of future benefits, through a reduction in damages\nawarded5. \nBetween 1948 and the 1980's a number of changes to the system were made in terms of the\nbenefits to be taken into account and the proportion of benefits to be recovered. The amount\ndeducted varied according to the benefit concerned. For example, 50% of industrial injuries\nbenefits and invalidity benefit was taken into account while statutory sick pay was deducted\nin full. Attendance allowance and mobility allowance were ignored. Also, courts deducted\namounts from compensation payments but these did not have to be paid to the DSS by\ncompensators. In effect therefore, the negligent party (or his insurer) could be argued to have\nbeen receiving a subsidy at the expense of the taxpayer who was meeting the cost of the\nbenefits paid. A summary of the former treatment of social security can be found in a\nNational Audit Office Report - Recovery of social security benefits when damages in tort are\nawarded.6 One crucial difference between the present and old systems is that, before the 1989\nAct, benefit was recovered solely from damages awarded for loss of earnings. Since 1989\nrecovery is made from total damages including those awarded for pain and suffering in\naddition to loss of earnings.\nThe Government introduced a recovery scheme in the Social Security Act 1989 in an attempt\nto deal with the inconsistencies between the treatment of different benefits. This followed a\nconsultation exercise and recommendations by the Public Accounts Committee.7 This\nscheme is now incorporated in the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\nThe Compensation Recovery Scheme is administered by the Compensation Recovery Unit\n(CRU) which is part of the Benefit Agency and is staffed by around 200 civil servants.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n4 Social Insurance and Allied Services, Report by Sir William Beveridge, November 1942 Cmd 6404, \npara 260: 'An injured person should not have the same need met twice over.'\n5\n Law Reform (Personal Injuries ) Act 1948\n6\n HC 353 of 1985/6\n \n7 Recovery of social security benefits when damages in tort are awarded HC 120 1987/88\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nC. The Current System of Recovery\nThe current rules on recovery of social security benefits from damages were introduced by\nthe Social Security Act 1989 with effect from 3 September 1990. They are now contained\nin Part IV the Social Security Administration Act 1992. They apply to payments over £2,500\nmade after 2 September 1990 to compensate for injuries or diseases which took place on or\nafter 1 January 1989. Under this scheme, an amount equal to 100% of certain social security\nbenefits may be deducted from compensation awards before they are paid to the claimants.\nThe relevant benefits are shown in

The Social Security Select Committee Enquiry\nI The Report\nIn July 1995, the Social Security Select Committee published a report on the work of the\nCRU.8 This Report made a number of criticisms of the present system.9 It argued that a\nnumber of cases the Committee had encountered were \"revolting to the ordinary man's sense\nof justice\" and that the system of compensation recovery as it currently stands \"appears to be\nhaving at least some deterrent effect on the pursuit of claims.\" In particular, the recovery\nfrom damages other than for those for loss of earnings was identified as being \"central to the\nunfairness identified with the present scheme.\" The report's main proposal was that the\nscheme should be revised so that damages awarded for loss earnings should be treated\ndifferently from those given for pain and suffering. The Committee could see that not to\nclawback benefits paid for loss of earnings would be compensating them twice over, once\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 Compensation Recovery, Fourth Report of the Social Security Committee, HC 196 1994-95, 21 June 1995.\n9 Ibid. paras 65-79.\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nthrough the benefits system and once through the damages award. However, it was unable\nto see how this argument could be extended to apply to damages paid for pain and suffering\nfor which no benefits would have been paid.\nThe Committee outlined these arguments as follows:10\nTo ensure that there is no double compensation, the amount included for\nbenefit recovery should be distinguished from the amount within the settlement\nfor special damages for loss of earnings in excess of the level received by the\nclaimant in the form of DSS benefits. If the amount of compensation for loss\nof earnings is lower than the amount paid in benefits, the amount equivalent\nto the total amount of benefit received should nevertheless be included in the\nclaim. Most importantly, the amounts in the settlement for pain, suffering,\nfuture earnings and any other element other than compensation for loss of\nearnings should not be subject to any clawback. In this way, the taxpayer\nwould be fully protected, receiving back through recovery all the money paid\nout in benefits. The individual would receive the full compensation settlement\napart from damages paid for loss of earnings up to the amount he had already\nreceived in the form of benefit. This method of recovery and reimbursement\nwould answer the varied complaints made about the present scheme: the\ndistortions of the small payments limit would be eliminated and any\ndisincentives to pursue claims because of fear of loss of settlements through\nrecovery would be removed.\nIf the taxpayer is protected and the individual gains, then the money in this\nfinancial equation must come from somewhere. We believe that it is right\nthat the compensator and insurer bear the cost reimbursing the taxpayer\nfor benefits paid to claimants as the result of accidents or injury or\ndisease. \nThe report went on to acknowledge that this would result in increased insurance premiums,\nbut it argued that spreading the cost in this way would be better than burdening individuals\nwho have had accidents or diseases caused by others. It might also be an incentive to settle\nclaims quicker.\nThe Committee was concerned that the £2,500 threshold could be an incentive for claims to\nbe settled at or below this unrecoverable level rather than above it when the whole might be\nsubject to recovery. It did not, however, make any specific recommendation about the\nthreshold.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n10\n op cit paras 76 & 77\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nII Government Response\nThe Government response to the Select Committee report was published on 2 October 199511.\nIt welcomed the recognition by the Select Committee of the necessity for some form of\ncompensation recovery to exist to avoid double compensation. It also believed the\nCommittee's recommendations that compensation should only be recovered from that part of\nthe award made for loss of earnings were important but it was unable to decide whether the\nCompensation Recovery scheme should be amended to this end. It therefore launched a\nconsultation exercise to determine the wider implications of the reforms suggested by the\nSelect Committee. Any reforms would be in the light of this and a compliance cost\nassessment, showing the likely cost to business. In reaching its decision the Government's\nstated central objective was \"to deliver a system that is fair and is seen to be fair - to the\nplaintiff and the defendant, to Business and to the taxpayer\".12\nThe consultation document was included with the Government response and the closing date\nfor submissions was 13 November 1995. When the initial consultation period ended, a further\nexercise, including consultation, was mounted to assess the full effects on business of\namending the current scheme. The consultation period for this Compliance Cost Assessment\nended on 29 April 1996. \nIII The Compliance Cost Assessment\nThe compliance cost assessment, produced by Price Waterhouse for the DSS, estimated there\nwould be additional annual costs to insurers of between £54 million and £79 million which\nif passed on to customers would increase employer liability premiums by between 3.7% and\n5.6%.13 \nPrice Waterhouse also looked at the effect on the CRU. They estimated that abolition of the\nsmall payments limit of £2,500 would lead to an increase of between 47% and 55% in the\nvolume of cases processed by the CRU. They also concluded that additional staff, between\n100 and 200 would be required if the time taken to process cases were not to be increased\nby more than 20%. Although some of this increase could be absorbed through improved IT\nsystems some rise in staffing and consequently larger premises, may be required. There\nwould also be an increase in workload of local Benefit Agency offices which would be\nrequired to provide detailed information on benefits received for CRU staff.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n11 Reply by the Government to the Fourth Report of the Select Committee on Compensation Recovery, Cm 2997\n12 DSS Press Release 2 Oct 1995 Government to consult on compensation recovery scheme\n13 Compliance cost assessment: compensation recovery scheme. Prepared at the request of Dept of Social Security.\nPrice Waterhouse. 1996.\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nIn terms of the increase in the amount of benefit recoverable if the small payments limit was\nabolished, Price Waterhouse concluded 'a reasonable conservative estimate is that in total a\nfurther £58 million to £65 million of benefit could potentially be recouped.'\nE. Reactions to the Consultation Exercise\nA summary of the responses to the Government's consultation exercise was placed in the\nLibrary by the Secretary of State.14 There was a broad consensus on the principle of\nprotecting damages awarded for pain and suffering from benefit recovery. The abolition of\nthe small payments limit was more contentious. The Association of British Insurers believes:\nthat the real objectives of government will be better achieved by ring-fencing pain and suffering and loss\nof amenity whilst at the same time preserving the small payments limit (SPL). Indeed, we believe that\nabolition of the SPL would generate little extra revenue for Government whilst imposing an onerous\nadministrative burden on all parties concerned.15\nThe Law Society also had reservations about abolishing the small payments limit. It\nrecognised that the existing limit could mean that some claims are settled at or below £2,500\nto avoid recovery but thought that complete abolition of the limit could deter some plaintiffs\nwith small claims and that the resulting increased administrative burden on the DSS would\nmake the scheme unworkable. \nWhile we are not necessarily advocating retention of exactly the present limit, we would strongly\nrecommend that both for administrative reasons and to give plaintiffs with small claims an incentive to\npursue them, a small payments exemption limit should remain.16\nThe National Consumer Council acknowledged that 'once the repayments are taken from a\nseparate head of damages ... it is for the Government to decide if the taxpayer should go on\nabsorbing payments of up to £67 million per year that the courts might well consider to be\nlegally the responsibility of those who caused injury and their insurers.' However, they went\non to express reservations if the two central recommendations were linked and 'protecting\ndamages from clawback is sacrificed because of the costs of abolishing the small payments\nlimit.'17\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 Deposited Paper 2819 February 1996\n15 ABI Compensation Recovery Scheme 4 June 1996\n16 The Law Society Civil Litigation Committee Response to Compliance Cost Assessment of the Compensation\nRecovery Scheme, April 1996\n17 NCC The cost of compensation recovery May 1996\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nF. The Bill's Proposals \nThe Bill redrafts and amends Part IV of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 Sections\n81-105. A number of the clauses are therefore a rewording of the original legislation.\nThe main changes which would be brought about by the Bill will:\n• restrict recovery of specified benefits to the part(s) of a compensation award made for loss\nof earnings, loss of mobility and the cost of care. This will enable victims of personal\ninjury or disease to keep their damages for pain and suffering. \n• remove the £2,500 ceiling below which compensation recovery does not currently take\nplace. The Bill does retain the power to disregard small payments in the future18. The\nGovernment have said that they do not intend to use this power but wish to retain it if it\nbecomes necessary to introduce a limit in the light of experience of the new system.19 The\nsmall payments limit was the subject of significant discussion during the Committee stage\nin the Lords20.\nDuring its passage in the Lords, the Bill received general support from Labour and Liberal\nDemocrat frontbenches.\nThe Bill does not include provision to adjust recovery of compensation in cases where there\nis contributory negligence, nor has any exemption from recovery for those suffering from\nasbestos related conditions been included. Both these were the subject of recommendations\nof the Select Committee, and some respondents to the consultation exercise.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n18 Schedule 1, Part II\n19 HL Deb 10 Dec 96 c951\n20 HL Deb 10 Dec 1996 c943-952\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nClause 1 sets out the cases to which the Bill applies. It provides for any case where a\npayment is made either by an individual, or on behalf of an individual, to another person as\na result of an accident, injury or disease. It applies where any of the listed benefits have been\npaid during the relevant period. The listed benefits and the heads of compensation to which\nthey apply are contained in Schedule 2 and detailed in Figure 3.\nSubsection (3) allows for payments to come under the scheme regardless of whether they have\nbeen made as result of a court order or through mutual agreement between the parties. It also\ncovers payments made from outside the United Kingdom.\nSubsection (4) defines the terms \"injured person\", \"compensation payment\" and \"recoverable\nbenefit\". These definitions are in line with those under section 81 of the Social Security\nAdministration Act 1992.\nBenefits and recovery under the new

Compensation for\nloss of mobility during\nthe relevant period\nMobility allowance\nMobility component of\ndisability living\nallowance\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nClause 2 defines the compensation payments to which the Act will apply. These will\ngenerally be payments made on or after the day on which Section 2 is brought into force (by\ncommencement order). The exception is payments made in pursuance of a court order or\nagreement made before that day.\nIt is the Government's intention to apply the new rules to settlements made after October\n1997.21\nThe new system is therefore likely to be applied to outstanding cases and to injuries and\ndiseases that have already taken place or been diagnosed. The Law Officers are said to be\ncontent with this element of retrospection. The insurers who may have to make larger overall\npayments as a result of the provisions of the Bill, will have had a year's notice in which to\nreset premia.22\nClause 3 defines the \"relevant period\" for benefit recovery. This means that benefit recovery\ncan take place for five years from the date following any accident or injury or five years from\nthe date of claim of a listed benefit in respect of a disease, or up to the date of the final\nsettlement or award if that is sooner. This is the same as under the 1992 Act except\nsubsection (4) allows that in the case when an earlier payment is later decided to be the final\none the end of the relevant period is the date of that agreement and not the date of the earlier\npayment. This would mean that benefit could be reclaimed for a period after a payment\nwhich turns out to be the final settlement. \nDuring the passage of the Bill in the House of Lords, Baroness Hollis of Heigham criticised\nthe definition of the 'relevant period' arguing that people who suffered a disease are treated\nless fairly than those who have suffered an accident:\nWith injury the clock starts ticking from the point when the injury occurs, but with disease the clock\nstarts ticking from when the victim makes a benefit claim and not when the disease is first diagnosed. 23\nFor the Government, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish responded to this by pointing out that the\nBill's provisions largely mirror those used in the post-1989 system and that these had worked\nwell. He believed there would be significant dangers to the smooth operation of the scheme\nif the definition of the period were changed to incorporate the date of diagnosis.\nClauses 4 and 5 set out the procedures under which a compensator must apply for a\ncertificate of recoverable benefits before a compensation payment is made and the information\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n21 DSS Press Notice 8 Nov 96\n22 DSS Social Security (Recovery of Benefits Bill) Notes on Clauses House of Lords Nov 1996\n23 HL Deb 10 December 1996 c 968\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nto be provided. Subsections (2) and (3) would require the Secretary of State to acknowledge\nan application for a certificate within 4 weeks. \nClauses 6 and 7 are the provisions which cover the liability of the compensator to pay the\ntotal amount of the recoverable benefits. Compensators would be liable for the amount of\nrecoverable benefit immediately before the compensation payment is made. Clause 7 allows\nthe Secretary of State to demand immediate payment of recoverable benefits in cases where\npayment has not been made, or a compensator has not applied for a certificate, and allows for\ncivil proceedings to recover the amount due.\nClauses 8 and 9 are new provisions. Clause 8 sets out the relationship between\ncompensation paid against certain heads of compensation and the related benefits listed\nagainst those heads. The heads of compensation and the related benefits are listed in columns\n1 and 2 of Schedule 2 to the Bill (see figure 3). All compensation can be recovered against\nthe list of benefits except that awarded against a head of pain and suffering. There is no\nsuch distinction under the current legislation. Clause 9 would require the compensator to\ninform the injured party of the details of the payment and any reductions made in respect of\nrecoverable benefits.\nClauses 10-14 Reviews and Appeals\nIn the 2nd reading of the Bill in the House of Lords, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, Minister\nof State for Social Security outlined the Government's plans to reform the current appeals\nprocess:\nWe plan to streamline the present appeal system for benefit recover decisions, which is complex and has\nled to difficulties. I should make it plain that we have no intention of diminishing the rights to appeal\nwhich exist in this area; in fact our reforms should make the process more intelligible and therefore more\naccessible.24\nAs under the current legislation the Secretary of State would be allowed to review a certificate\nof recoverable benefit. An extra provision allows the Secretary of State to increase the\namount shown on the certificate if it is believed that the person who applied for the certificate\nsupplied incorrect or insufficient information (Clause 10 subsection(3)).\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n24 HL Deb 19 November 1996 c 1204\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nClause 11 contains the provisions for appeals. These are similar to those currently contained\nin Section 98 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. Subsection (5) allows for\nregulation to make provisions for the manner and time limits of appeals as under the current\nlegislation.\nClause 12 provides for appeals against a certificate of recoverable benefits to be referred to\nmedical appeal tribunals. Currently, appeals are dealt with by either a social security appeal\ntribunal or a medical appeal tribunal depending on the nature of the appeal. All appeals\nwould in future be dealt with by a medical appeal tribunal as part of the Government's\nattempts to simplify the procedures. Subsection (3) confirms the current legislation in\nimposing a duty on any tribunal to take into account a previous decision of a court. An\nopposition amendment in the House of Lords to bind a tribunal to any previous court decision\nwas defeated.\nClause 13 reconfirms existing provisions which allow an appeal to a Social Security\nCommissioner on the grounds that a decision was wrong in point of law. \nClause 14 provides that if in the event of an appeal or review changing the amount of\nrecoverable benefit, payment of the balance is to be paid by the party concerned. This\nlargely restates existing provisions.\nClauses 15-17 The Courts\nIn order to differentiate between the various heads of damages outlined in Schedule 2 the\ncourts need to identify the amounts of the compensation payment attributable to each head\nof compensation. Clause 15 imposes a duty on the court to specify the amounts when\nmaking an order for compensation. This enables the amount of recoverable benefit to be\nestablished.\nClause 16 provides for regulations to modify the sections of the Bill which relate to payments\nmade into court. The provisions which regulations could allow are currently included in the\nexisting legislation. Clause 17 restates the current legislation which does not allow the\namount of recoverable benefit to be considered in an assessment of damages by the court. \n          \nClauses 18 and 19 provides for regulations which may make provision to modify existing\nclauses in complex cases involving more than one payment in respect of the same injury or\ndisease. These are currently contained within the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nIn their notes on the clauses, the DSS argue that interim payments form only a small part of\nthe scheme and it is therefore appropriate that they should be governed by regulations.\nClauses 20-24 are miscellaneous technical clauses. Clause 20 allows for regulations to\ngovern the recovery of benefits when the injured party has received an overpayment of\nbenefit. Under current legislation, overpayments of benefit can only be recovered from the\ninjured party who has received them. Under this clause regulations could be made which\nwould allow the repayment of any overpayment to be made directly from the compensation\npayment. Clause 21 sets out the provision for disregarding compensation payments when a\ncompensator has followed the procedures for applying for a certificate of recoverable benefit\nbut has not received the correct notification from the department within the specified time.\nClause 22 was added by a Government amendment in the House of Lords and covers the\nliability of insurers to repay recoverable benefits when they are responsible for making\ncompensation payments. Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish said the amendment was necessary\nto \"put it beyond doubt that policies of insurance cover the liability to repay benefit.\"25\nClause 23 restates Section 94 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 which covers\nthe provision of information to the Secretary of State (ie the Department of Social Security)\nof the details of a compensation case. The time and manner of the notification would be\ncovered by regulations as at present. Clause 24 allows Schedule 2 to be amended by\nregulations under the affirmative procedure. The benefits to be recovered and the heads of\ndamages under which payments could be recovered, could therefore be amended without\nprimary legislation but the amendments would have to go before both Houses of Parliament. \nClauses 25-27 Northern Ireland\nThese clauses replicate existing provisions where a compensator and/or injured party is\nresident in Northern Ireland. \nClauses 28-31 General\nThese clauses define the terms used in the Bill, provide for any power under the Bill to make\nregulations to be exercisable by statutory instrument and restate existing legislation which\nallows for payments to and from the National Insurance and Consolidated Funds to the extent\nit is estimated they relate to compensation payments.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n25 HL Deb 14 January 1997 c 138\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nClause 32 and 33 provide for regulations to make transitional arrangements considered\nnecessary. \nClause 34 details the formal citation for the Act should the Bill be passed.\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 97/13\nG.

This exercise will\nin some cases have a noticeable effect on the unemployment figures which are published for\nsmall local areas, including parliamentary constituencies. Until now, unemployment statistics\nhave been published for geographic areas (constituencies, local authority districts etc) which\nare defined in terms of local authority wards as they existed in April 1981. From May 1996\nmonthly unemployment data will be based on a frozen 1991 geographical base. \nThe Library is taking this opportunity to update the denominators used for estimating\nresidence-based unemployment rates from the 1988 ones used until now to ones derived from\nthe 1991 Census of Population.\nIt should be noted that this change does not in any way affect the definition of unemployment\nused; it only affects the way in which the figures are presented for small geographic areas.\nII Monthly unemployment statistics defined\nThe monthly unemployment figures are a by-product of the social security system. The\nclaimant count relates to the number of people claiming unemployment benefit, income\nsupport or national insurance credits at an Employment Service local office (formerly\nUnemployment Benefit Offices or UBOs). In order to meet the eligibility criteria for these\nbenefits, individuals, for each day they are claiming, have to be:\n• unemployed;\n• available for work;\n• \"actively seeking\" work in the week in which the day falls.\nThose aged under 18 are only able to claim unemployment-related benefits on the grounds\nof severe hardship. The unemployment count is usually performed on the second Thursday\nof each month and is derived from administrative records, which are now almost completely\ncomputerised. Postcodes of claimants' home addresses are allocated to electoral wards and\nthese form the building blocks for unemployment statistics for constituencies, local authority\nareas, travel-to-work areas, regions and ultimately the country as a whole. Figures for the\nnumber of unemployed claimants are then combined with estimates of the workforce in local\nlabour markets to calculate unemployment rates.\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\nIt is recognised that this measure of unemployment excludes certain individuals who would\nnormally be considered unemployed, but who, because they are not entitled to benefit, are not\nincluded in the count. At the same time there are individuals who are claiming benefit but\nin one way or another may not be considered strictly unemployed, because they are already\nworking part-time or are not immediately available for work, for example. \nIn spite of these failings this measure of unemployment has the advantages of being relatively\ncheap to compile, figures are collected and processed quickly and, because it is a full count\nrather than a survey, it can provide detailed analyses of local areas and age groups. However,\nthe disadvantage is that apparent differences in the number or rate of unemployment between\ntwo dates may reflect changes in the methodology of the unemployment count or changes in\nthe social security system rather than actual changes in the labour market.\nIII Unemployment rates\nA. ONS Unemployment Rates\nIn order to compare the level of unemployment in one area with that in another it is usual to\nexpress the number of unemployed claimants as a proportion of the labour force. The ONS's\nunemployment statistics are compiled on the basis of where people live, but their employment\nstatistics (the main part of the divisor in this calculation) are on the basis of place of work.\nUntil May 1996, the smallest areas for which the ONS calculates unemployment rates were\ntherefore those which form a reasonably self-contained labour market. These are where a\nsignificant proportion of people both live and work, and are known as travel-to-work areas\n(TTWAs). The ONS's basic criterion for a self-contained labour market is that at least 75%\nof the people who live in the area should also work there, and that 75% who work in the area\nshould also live there. The ONS's rates provide an idea of relative labour market positions\nbetween areas. The unemployment rate in each of the 334 TTWAs in the UK is published\nin table 2.4 of the ONS's monthly Labour Market Trends (formerly the Employment Gazette).\nIn May 1996 the ONS began to publish unemployment rates for the new unitary authorities\nin England, Wales and Scotland. Whilst some of these areas are, geographically speaking,\nquite large (and could therefore be thought of as being reasonably self-contained labour\nmarkets), others are much smaller and do not meet the self-containment criteria.\nThe travel-to-work patterns reflect data collected in the 1981 Census of Population. There\nare no plans at present to update TTWA geographies to reflect information available from the\n1991 Census1.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n     \n1 HC Deb 21st June 1995 c280W\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\nONS unemployment rates are usually expressed as a proportion of the workforce. The\nworkforce is comprised of employees in employment, the self-employed, HM Forces, those\nparticipating in Government-supported government training schemes (largely Youth Training\nand Training for Work) and the unemployed. The workforce-based rate was introduced from\nJuly 1988 -partly in recognition of the growing importance of the self-employed - and has\nalmost completely displaced the narrow-based rate (which expresses unemployed claimants\nas a percentage simply of employees in employment and the unemployed). \nB. Residence-based unemployment rates\nOne problem of using the ONS's workforce-based unemployment rates is that, especially in\nurban areas, TTWAs can conceal significant variations in the level of unemployment within\ntheir boundaries. In terms of parliamentary constituencies, only a handful in the United\nKingdom exactly match a TTWA. In many cases, one TTWA includes a number of\nconstituencies (for example, virtually the whole of Greater London is in a single TTWA) but\nin rural areas there can be more than one TTWA within a constituency. \nIn order to compare unemployment rates between constituencies it is necessary to look at the\nemployment status of its residents using a different denominator. Although unemployment\nfigures built up using claimants' postcodes are available every month, no similar data are\ncompiled for employees or the self-employed. Such figures that are available usually come\nfrom the decennial Census of Population, the latest being for 1991. \nFor the past five years the Library has used estimates of the workforce resident in each\nconstituency compiled by CACI Information Services Ltd as the denominators in the\ncalculation of residence-based unemployment rates for constituencies in Great Britain. These\nrates expressed the number of unemployed claimants as a percentage of the estimated labour\nforce for 1988. Full methodological details of how these were compiled are contained in the\nLibrary Background Paper No. 292 but, in broad terms, the denominators were projections\nbased on the 1981 Census of Population.\nMore recently, residence-based unemployment rates for Northern Ireland constituencies have\nbeen produced which use denominators from the 1991 Census of Population. This\nopportunity is being taken to change to denominators from the 1991 Census for all\nconstituencies in the United Kingdom.\nResidence-based rates show the proportion of the economically-active population resident in\na particular constituency who are unemployed. These rates have a different interpretation\nfrom the ONS's rates. They provide a social measure of local deprivation (ie. the proportion\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\nof local residents who are out of work) rather than an economic measure of the mismatch\nbetween the demand for and supply of labour. This is because they take no account of the\npossibility of unemployed individuals seeking work outside the area in which they live. Due\nto social factors, the unemployed are not always evenly spread throughout a TTWA. These\ndifferences, which are not apparent from the official TTWA rates, are revealed by\nresidence-based unemployment rates. Thus the unemployment rate in the local TTWA will\nprovide a guide to the labour market situation in a constituency whereas the residence-based\nrate will provide an indicator of social conditions.\nC. Workforce and residence-based unemployment rates compared\nONS unemployment rates use the present month's unemployment total as the numerator and\nworkforce estimates for mid-1995 as the denominator2. The residence-based constituency\nrates in this paper use the same numerator but the denominator is the number of people in\neach constituency recorded as being economically active at the time of the 1991 Census of\nPopulation. This covers anyone in a full- or part-time job (including the self-employed and\nthose on Government training schemes) as well as those seeking or waiting to take up a job\nand people prevented from seeking work because of temporary sickness or holiday. The\nfollowing table compares regional unemployment rates in March 1996 calculated using\nresidence- and workforce-based denominators. \nUnemployment Rates by Region\nMarch 1996, seasonally adjusted\nCensus 91 Workforce 91 Workforce 95\nRegion Claimants Rate Rate Rate\nSouth East 302,000 5.7 5.9 6.0\nEast Anglia 61,700 6.1 6.1 5.8\nLondon 372,700 10.9 9.0 9.2\nSouth West 153,300 6.9 6.6 6.5\nWest Midlands 195,600 7.8 7.5 7.9\nEast Midlands 139,100 7.1 7.1 7.3\nYorkshire and Humberside 196,800 8.5 8.2 8.4\nNorth West 240,200 8.2 7.8 8.4\nNorthern 140,500 10.0 10.0 10.1\nWales 104,700 8.3 8.3 8.3\nScotland 194,700 8.1 7.8 8.0\nNorthern Ireland 85,300 12.5 11.1 11.0\nUnited Kingdom 2,186,600 8.0 7.7 7.8\nSource: Off ice for National S tatistics (NOMIS ) © Crow n Copy right\nThe differences between the unemployment rates which both use workforce estimates for the\ndenominator can be explained by changes in the size of the workforce between 1991 and\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n     \n2 Mid-1995 denominators for TTWAs will be introduced in June.\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\n1995. In some cases - East Anglia for instance - the workforce has fallen, whereas in others -\nthe West Midlands for example - the workforce has grown in size. The graph below\ncompares the unemployment rates calculated firstly with the 1991 Census denominator and\nsecondly with the 1991 workforce denominator.\nUnemployment Rates by Region\nMarch 1996, seasonally adjusted\nSouth E\nast\nEast An\nglia London South W\nest\nWest M\nidlands\nEast M\nidlands\nYorks a\nnd Hum\nberside North W\nest Norther\nn Wales Scotlan\nd\nNorther\nn Irelan\nd\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\nper cent\n1991 Census \ndenominator\n1991 Workforce \ndenominator\nFor most regions, the difference between the two unemployment rates is small (and in some\ncases, zero when expressed to one decimal place). The only areas with significantly different\nrates are London and Northern Ireland. In the case of London, this is to be expected since\nbeing an area with a net inflow of commuters, the workforce denominator is significantly\nlarger than the residence-based denominator. This is also likely to be a factor in the case of\nNorthern Ireland, since people also commute from the Republic to work in Northern Ireland.\nIV Geographical Disaggregation\nAs mentioned above, unemployed claimants are allocated to electoral wards on the basis of\ntheir postcode. Unfortunately, from a statistical point of view, the boundaries of electoral\nwards are periodically re-drawn. To overcome this problem, the unemployment statistics are\nbased on what are termed \"frozen\" wards, that is to say geographical boundaries as they were\ndefined at one particular point in time. \nEver since unemployment statistics became available on a ward basis in September 1984 (with\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\ndata back-calculated to June 1983), the figures for England and Wales have related to frozen\n1981 ward boundaries3 (constituencies, districts and counties being aggregations of wards).\nThe unemployment figures for April 1996 (released in May) and subsequent months use\nfrozen 1991 ward boundaries as their geographical basis for all parts of the United Kingdom.\nFor a more detailed explanation of this topic, please refer to the Technical Notes in Section\nIX. Figures for January, February and March 1996 have also been re-released on a 1991 ward\nbasis so that a complete calendar year's data for 1996 will eventually be available. \nThis change has a number of implications:\n• Figures are now available for the new unitary authorities in England, Wales and\nScotland;\n• It is possible to produce figures for the new Parliamentary constituencies4 (the\nconstituencies on which the next general election will be contested);\n• The denominators used for calculating residence-based unemployment rates for\nconstituencies can be updated (the change brings monthly unemployment data onto the\nsame geographical basis as the 1991 Census of Population);\nThere is one major disadvantage with this change however; back-runs of figures for dates\nprior to January 1996 will not be available on the 1991 ward basis. This means that for many\nconstituencies, there will be a discontinuity in the time-series of figures at the end of 1995.\nFor areas which are only defined in terms of 1991 wards (ie new Parliamentary constituencies\nand unitary authorities) figures will not be published at all for dates prior to 1996.\nV Residence-based constituency unemployment rates\nA. Results for March 1996\nAppendix 1 shows the twenty-five constituencies in Great Britain with the highest residence-\nbased unemployment rates at March 1996 together with the twenty-five with the lowest\nunemployment rates. These were originally published in Research Paper 96/51. The statistics\nare based on 1981 frozen ward boundaries and use the 1988 denominators estimated by CACI.\nAll the constituencies at the two extremes of high and low unemployment rates are in\nEngland. The Welsh constituency with the highest unemployment rate (Carnarfon) ranked\n81st highest in Great Britain, whilst the Scottish constituency with the highest rate (Glasgow\nSpringburn) ranked 45th highest in Great Britain.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n     \n3 Frozen 1984 wards in Scotland and frozen 1985 wards in Northern Ireland.\n     \n4 At present, it is only possible to provide figures for the new constituencies in England and Wales.\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\nThe unemployment rates for Northern Ireland constituencies which were published in\nResearch Paper 96/51 were not strictly comparable with those for Great Britain because they\nalready used the figures from the 1991 Census of Population for the denominator.\nAppendix 2 shows the twenty-five constituencies in the United Kingdom with highest\nresidence-based unemployment rates at March 1996 together with the twenty-five with the\nlowest unemployment rates. These figures are all based on 1991 frozen ward boundaries and\nuse the denominators obtained from the 1991 Census of Population. Constituencies are\nranked within each home country as well as for the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that\nthe rankings would be somewhat different if the male or female rates were considered\nseparately. \nThe published figures for both unemployed claimants and the economically active population\nfor Bethnal Green & Stepney and Bow & Poplar are thought to contain an error, due to a\nward being misallocated between the two constituencies. Since the error relates to both the\nnumerator and the denominator, the unemployment rates should not be significantly affected.\nAt the time of writing, this is being investigated by the ONS and NOMIS.\nB. Comparison of Unemployment Rates\nAppendix 3 provides an alphabetical list of all 634 constituencies in Great Britain showing\nthe number of unemployed claimants on the 1981 and 1991 ward bases, and the\nunemployment rates using the 1988 and 1991 denominators (Northern Ireland constituencies\nare excluded from this table because there have been no changes). The penultimate column\nof the table shows the extent of the difference in the unemployment rates on the two bases,\nexpressed in terms of percentage points. (The last column ranks constituencies according to\nthis change). The overall difference will be a combination of several factors:\n• The extent of boundary changes between the 1981 and 1991 ward base. Some parts\nof the country have not had any ward changes at all, so the boundaries of\nconstituencies in these areas will therefore be unaffected.\n• The distribution of unemployed claimants within each constituency. It is possible that\nboundary changes could have occurred in a constituency between 1981 and 1991 but\nif no unemployed claimant lives in the ward(s) affected then there will be no apparent\neffect on the unemployment figures for the constituency. Conversely, if there is a\nvery high concentration of unemployed claimants living in ward(s) affected by\nboundary changes then the effect on the unemployment figures would be far more\nsignificant.\n• The extent of the change in the economically active population between 1988 and\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\n1991. In some areas there has been a comparatively large increase or decrease in the\neconomically active population resident in each constituency. An increase will, all\nother things being equal, cause the unemployment rate to be lower than it previously\nwas. A decrease in the economically active population will conversely serve to\nincrease the residence-based unemployment rate.\nMany of the constituencies experiencing the biggest increase in unemployment rates between\nthe two methods of compilation are those in inner city areas: Birmingham Small Heath,\nManchester Central, Glasgow Provan and so on. This is more to do with a decrease in the\nsize of the denominator than it is a change in the geographical coverage of the constituency.\n(In the vast majority of constituencies the change in the size of the denominator has been\nproportionately larger than the change in the number of claimants).\nVI Future Plans\nThe next general election will be contested on new parliamentary constituencies. Overall,\nthere will be eight additional seats: five in England, two in Wales and one in Northern\nIreland. Many more constituencies (including some in Scotland) have had their boundaries\nre-drawn. \nThe new parliamentary constituencies were defined in terms of the wards as they existed at\nthe time of the Boundary Commission Reviews: 1995. For the purposes of unemployment\nstatistics however, they will also be defined in terms of 1991 frozen wards on a best-fit basis.\nFor constituencies in England and Wales this process is already complete, and unemployment\nfigures will be available for new constituencies when 1991 ward-based statistics are available.\nIt is hoped that figures for Scotland will be available towards the end of 1996.\nIt is already possible to re-aggregate ward data from the 1991 Census of Population to form\ndenominators for calculating unemployment rates for new constituencies in England and\nWales. The House of Commons Library intends to produce estimated rates for the new\nconstituencies in due course.\nVII Other sources of local area unemployment data\nA. Labour Force Survey\nThe Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a quarterly survey carried out by interviewing individuals\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\nabout their personal circumstances and work. Topics covered include demographic\ncharacteristics (age, nationality, ethnicity, marital status), household characteristics (housing\ntenure, composition of household) and those relating to economic activity (employment,\nunemployment, income, hours). Each quarter the LFS covers around 150,000 people living\nat a representative sample of private addresses throughout the United Kingdom. Students in\nhalls of residence and people living in NHS accommodation are also included in the sample.\nThe LFS uses the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of unemployment. The\nILO definition includes those individuals who are:\n• without a paid job in the reference week\n• available to start work in the next fortnight; and\n• had either looked for work at some point in the last four weeks or were waiting to\nstart a job already obtained\nThis definition of unemployment is used by Eurostat (the Statistical Office of the European\nCommunity), the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD). The ILO definition has the advantage of being\ninternationally comparable, and has been used for the Labour Force Survey since 1984\nwithout being changed. The ONS are currently consulting a wide number of users of labour\nmarket statistics about the best way in which to make available monthly data from the LFS.\nAs the LFS is only a sample survey (unlike the monthly statistics for unemployed claimants\nand the Census of Population) it is not possible to disaggregate the figures into small\ngeographic areas in the same way. At the present time unemployment statistics based on the\nILO definition are available for most counties in Great Britain and for some of the larger\n(mainly Metropolitan) districts. Although in principle these figures can be broken down\nfurther to give separate figures for different sub-groups, it is usually the case that the samples\nare too small to provide estimates which are statistically reliable5.\nThe ONS has just published data from the LFS which is available at the local authority\ndistrict level6. This will only be for a very limited set of variables, but it will be possible to\ncalculate unemployment rates for all but the most sparsely populated districts. To overcome\nthe problem of small sample sizes, which has until now prevented the publication of statistics\nfor areas this small, results from four quarters' surveys have been aggregated to give annual\naverage figures. Whilst these will not be as timely as figures from the count of unemployed\nclaimants, they have the advantage of being based on internationally-agreed definitions. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n     \n5 Grossed-up estimates of less than 10,000 are not deemed to be sufficiently reliable to use.\n     \n6 For a full explanation of how these data are compiled, see Labour Market Trends (May 1996).\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\nB. Census of Population\nIn addition to providing figures for the overall number of people who are economically active,\nthe Census of Population also breaks down this total to show the number of people who are\nemployees (full- and part-time), self-employed (with and without employees), participating\nin a Government training scheme or who are unemployed. The Census definition of\nunemployment however is different from both the monthly count of unemployed claimants\nand the ILO definition. \nThe results from the Census are compiled from the questionnaire sent to each household in\nApril 1991 which would have been filled in (generally speaking) by the head of household.\nThe Census asked respondents if those they were answering for were “unemployed and\nlooking for a job”, and to “include any person wanting a job but prevented from looking by\nholiday or temporary sickness”. Thus whilst this includes the same factors as the ILO\ndefinition they are not qualified by specific time restrictions in the same way.\nUnemployment data from the 1991 Census of Population are, like the data for economic\nactivity, available for frozen 1991 wards and other areas built up from them. They can also\nbe cross-tabulated with other characteristics such as gender, age and ethnicity.\nVIII Technical Notes\nA. Unemployment totals \nPart of the information held about unemployed claimants includes details of their postcodes.\nThe ONS uses postcode information to allocate claimants to the appropriate electoral wards.\nThis mapping exercise is done by with the aid of a computer file known as the Central\nPostcode Directory (CPD), which is compiled and jointly maintained by the Royal Mail and\nONS. The CPD cross-references postcodes with codes for electoral wards and grid references.\nClaims which have an invalid or missing postcode are allocated to wards in proportion to the\ngeographical distribution of correctly coded claims. Data for wards then form the building\nblocks for larger geographical areas: constituencies, local authority districts, TTWAs etc.\nCPDs can either be current, reflecting up-to-date geographies, or frozen, in which case they\nreflect the situation at a particular point in time. Figures from the monthly count of\nunemployed claimants are coded using a frozen CPD which enables comparisons in the level\nof unemployment in a particular area to be made over a number of months or years without\nbeing affected by geographical changes. In May 1996 the ONS moved from using a frozen\n1981 CPD to a frozen 1991 CPD.\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\nB. Best-fitting of wards\nIt is important to note that for both the unemployment figures and the Census data used for\ncalculating unemployment rates, the constituency areas are those formed by best fitting wards\nto constituency boundaries. The ward boundaries are those which were in place in 1991 in\nEngland, Wales and Scotland; not necessarily current ones. For Northern Ireland\nconstituencies, the figures are based on 1985 ward boundaries which have not changed since\nthen. In some cases these areas will not conform exactly to the present constituency\nboundaries since re-warding of districts takes place on continuous basis. Such changes that\nare made are not generally major ones and are unlikely to affect the derived unemployment\nrates by more than ±0.1% points. \nC. Aggregation of Census data\nThe data from the 1991 Census of Population used for the denominators in calculating\nresidence-based unemployment rates were obtained from the dataset known as the Local Base\nStatistics. In the case of the Censuses for England and Wales, and Northern Ireland, the raw\ndata relate to areas known as \"Enumeration Districts\". These data are first aggregated into\nelectoral wards and then wards are aggregated to form constituency totals. In Scotland the\nraw data relate to \"Output Areas\". These figures are not available at a ward level but are\naggregated directly into higher level geographical areas such as constituencies and districts.\nThere is inevitably a time-lag between changes in electoral ward boundaries being\nincorporated into parliamentary constituencies. This means that wards are not always\ncoterminous with constituencies. Where this is the case, wards have been best-fitted to\nconstituencies on the basis of the constituency where the majority of the population are\nthought to live. Those constituencies where such a process has been employed are denoted\n\"***\" in all the tables in this paper.\nCensus data for constituencies have also been published by the Office for Population Censuses\nand Surveys (OPCS) in a series of Constituency Monitors. The aggregation of raw data in\nthese publications differs from that used in this paper in that (for England, Wales and\nNorthern Ireland) it aggregates figures directly from Enumeration Districts into constituencies.\nThis method of aggregation largely overcomes the need to best-fit wards which were subject\nto changes in boundaries, and produces what can be thought of as \"true\" constituency\nboundaries frozen as of April 1991. The differences between the two methods of compilation\nare in most cases extremely small; typically they are in the region of ±0.1% on the total\npopulation of the constituency.\n \n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\nThis latter source of Census denominators has not been used for this paper however because\nthe data for unemployed claimants have been aggregated in the same way as the Local Base\nStatistics. Thus whilst the figures relate to slightly more approximate constituency\nboundaries, the numerator (unemployed claimants) does relate to exactly the same\ngeographical area as the denominator (economically active population).\nD. Political Representation\nThe political party shown against each constituency is that of the current sitting MP. Where\nthere is a pending by-election the seat is deemed vacant. West Bromwich West, the seat\nrepresented by Madam Speaker, is not attributed to any Party. At the time of writing one\nConservative member has resigned the party whip. Bolton North East constituency is\ntherefore denoted CON* in the tables. The following abbreviations for parties have been\nused:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/63\nAppendix 1\nUnemployment by Constituency,

It was first noticed in the mid-1980s, and considerable\nresearch has since been undertaken. Many areas remain uncertain, however, and there is still\nno test for the disease in live animals, a fact which greatly complicates policies to control and\neradicate the disease. \nThe disease was identified by the Central Veterinary Laboratory in November 1986 following\nstudy of an affected cow. Initial epidemiological studies started in April 1987, and Ministers\nwere informed of the new disease on 5 June 1987. An experiment to determine the likely\ncause was then put under way, with results available in September 1988. On 15 December\n1987 the initial epidemiological studies were completed, concluding that the only viable\nhypothesis for the cause of BSE was feedstuffs containing meat and bonemeal from ruminants\n- in this case, sheep. On 21 April 1988 the Southwood Working Party was announced. This\nwas a working party, under the chairmanship of Professor Sir Richard Southwood FRS, to\nadvise on the implications of BSE and matters relevant thereto. The Government indicated\nthat they would legislate to make BSE notifiable and to ban feeding of rations that contained\nprotein derived from ruminants. On 21 June 1988 the disease was made notifiable, and\nisolation of suspects when calving was required by the BSE Order 1988.1 On 18 July 1988,\na temporary ruminant feed ban came into force.2 The exact wording of the ban required an\nimmediate end to the use of such feedstuffs, not simply to its production.\nProhibition of sale, supply and use of certain feedingstuff for feeding to ruminating animals\n(1) No person shall knowingly sell or supply for feeding to animals any feedingstuff in which\nhe knows or has reason to suspect any animal protein has been incorporated.\n(2) No person shall feed to an animal any feedingstuff in which he knows or has reason to\nsuspect that any animal protein has been incorporated.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1\n 1988 SI 1039\n2\n The Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Order 1988 (SI 1039)\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\nOn 5 August 1988, based on interim recommendations from Southwood, a slaughter policy\ncame into force, whereby animals with the disease were slaughtered. On 30 December 1988\nlegislation came into force to prolong the feed ban and to prohibit use of milk from suspect\ncattle for any purpose other than feeding to the cow's own calf.\nOn 27 February 1989 the Southwood Report was published and all its recommendations\naccepted. The establishment of the Tyrrell Committee on research was announced, following\na Southwood recommendation. The Tyrrell Report was received by Government on 10 June\n1989. On 13 June 1989 the decision to introduce a ban on the use of certain specified bovine\noffals was announced. This was a Government initiative, not a recommendation of\nSouthwood. On 13 November 1989 the Offals Ban Regulation came into force in England\nand Wales following consultation - a legal requirement - and consideration by top experts.3\nOn 30 January 1990 the offals ban was introduced in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n(B) The position in 1995\nThe restrictions in force before the present crisis are included in the Specified Bovine Offal\nOrder 19954 which came into force in August 1995, and represented a slight tightening up on\nthe previous position. The reason for the tightening was explained by the Minister5, who said\nthat the decline in the numbers of new cases showed that the ruminant feed ban was proving\nsuccessful in bringing the epidemic under control:\nHowever, we are continuing to see cases of BSE in animals born after the\nintroduction of the feed ban in July 1988. This suggests that there has been\nsome continued leakage of BSE infective material into animal feed.\nWe have already taken steps to prevent this by :\nintroducing new requirements, in April 1995, on the staining of specified bovine offal\n(SBO);\nreviewing the controls on SBO to consolidate and strengthen them;\nintroducing new EC standards at rendering plants and withdrawing from use a system\nwhich was found, in experiments, not to inactivate the BSE agent;\nidentifying, with the industry, the potential for cross-contamination in feed mills so that\nsystems can be tightened up;\nintroducing the use of a new test to detect the presence of ruminant protein in animal\nfeed.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3\n 1989 SI 1039\n4\n SI 1928\n5\n MA FF News Release, 19 July 1995\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\nHe said that the new Order would bring in the following main changes:\n(i) To require all rendering plants, head-boning plants, incinerators and collection points for\nspecified bovine offal to be approved by Ministers. Rendering plants will have to have a\ntotally dedicated processing line for specified bovine offal.\n(ii) Movement permits for specified bovine offal issued by local authorities will no longer\nbe required in view of tighter controls being introduced on approval and record keeping\nthroughout the disposal chain;\n(iii) The brains and eyes of a bovine animal of six months or more may no longer be\nremoved from the head so that the part of a skull containing brain and eyes, after removal of\nthe head meat and tongue for human consumption, will have to be disposed of as specified\nbovine offal.\nIt is clear from the surveillance of slaughterhouses and head-boning plants that has been\nundertaken by my officials since the Government took over full responsibility for control of\nsuch premises in April this year, that current practice on the separation and staining of the\nspecified bovine offals can be improved. Most of the failings we have identified are\ncomparatively minor in nature - for instance using the wrong stain - and plant operators have\nbeen given clear instructions on what they must do to put things right. But some could have\nresulted in BSE infected material entering the animal feed chain. Further follow up visits are\nbeing made to ensure that the faults have been rectified....Although these lapses in our animal\nhealth control system are unsatisfactory, consumers have no cause for alarm. I am satisfied\nthat these findings have no implications for human health and that measures to ensure that no\ninfective material enters the human food chain are working effectively.\nIn November 1995, however, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee was\nconcerned that the State Veterinary Service had found that in a small number of cases the\nspinal cord had not been properly removed in mechanically recovered meat. The Committee\nconcluded that, unless and until there was full compliance with the requirement to remove the\nspinal cord, it would be prudent, as a precaution, to suspend the use of bovine vertebrae in\nthe manufacture of mechanically recovered meat6.\n(C) The position since 20 March 1996\nThe present crisis began with the announcement by the Secretary of State for Health about\nnew conclusions from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee.7\nThe committee has considered the work being done by the Government surveillance unit in\nEdinburgh, which specialises in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. That work, which relates to the\n10 cases of CJD that have been identified in people aged under 42, has led the committee to\nconclude that the unit has identified a previously unrecognised and consistent disease pattern.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n6\n MA FF News Release 28 November 1995\n7\n HC Deb 20 March 1996 c.375\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\nA review of patients' medical histories, genetic analysis and consideration of other possible\ncauses have failed to explain those cases adequately.\nThere remains no scientific proof that bovine spongiform encephalopathy can be transmitted\nto man by beef, but the committee has concluded that the most likely explanation at present\nis that those cases are linked to exposure to BSE before the introduction of the specified\nbovine offal ban in 1989... \nThe clearest statement of the Government's action came in the speech by Mr Hogg in the\ndebate on 28 March 1996.8 \nI am pursuing the following timetable. Orders are being laid today that will have the effect\nof banning, from tomorrow, the manufacture of feeding stuffs for farm animals using\nmammalian meat and bonemeal and extending SBO controls to cover heads and lymph glands.\nAs a temporary measure, I am also banning the sale of meat from newly slaughtered cattle\naged over 30 months. This measure will apply until we have in place a procedure for\nlicensing and supervising deboning plans, as recommended by SEAC. I am under a legal\nobligation to consult on the order introducing those procedures and on a proposed ban on the\nuse of bonemeal in agricultural fertilisers. Despite that statutory obligation, I am proceeding\nrapidly. The consultation document has been issued, and I intend to make the relevant\nlegislation in the week beginning 15 April...\nThe order to which I have referred has the effect of preventing cattle over the age of 30\nmonths from entering the food chain, but the hon Gentleman should remember SEAC's\nrecommendation that animals over that age could come into the food chain provided they did\nso in a deboned state, the deboning taking place in premises approved for that purpose...The\norder...is temporary in character and will cover the situation until such time as we can put in\nplace the licensing regime that will enable farmers to sell cattle over the age of 30 months,\nthe meat being in a deboned state...\nThe first [announcement] concerns the problem of the renderers, which is important because\nif the renderers cannot operate the slaughterhouse system will seize up and it will be\nimpossible for farmers to sell their beef. Therefore the Government will make available\ntransitional aid of around £1.5 million for week to help the rendering industry adjust to the\nchanges...\nThe second announcement relates to the immediate problem of the young bull calves, for\nwhich there is not a market at present. I told the House on 25 March that a European Union\nmarket support scheme existed, which could be used to provide aid for the slaughter of young\nmale calves from dairy herds. I am announcing today that we shall avail ourselves of that\nscheme, providing a premium of slightly more than £100 per head on all such calves\nslaughtered before reaching 10 days of age. That will be reviewed as the market position\nimproves. I estimate that it will be worth some £50 million per year to UK farmers...\nThe orders were the following :\n1. The Beef (Emergency Control) Order 1996 (SI 961)\n2. The Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (A mendment) Order 1996 (SI 962)\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8\n HC Deb 28 March 1996 cc. 1230-1233\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\n3. The Specified Bovine Material Order 1996 (SI 963)\n4. The Fertilisers (Mammalian Meat and Bone Meal) Regulations 1996\nThe ban on meat from cattle of over 30 months is no longer seen as a short-term measure to\nlast only until the deboning arrangements are finalised. That was made clear by the Minister\nin a further announcement on 16 April.9\nThe House is aware that animals slaughtered at 30 months of age or more are now excluded\nfrom the food chain, and of the expectation that farmers would be compensated by an EC\nscheme. I can announce today that such a scheme will come into effect in the week beginning\n29 April, and will also be run by the intervention board. Depending on the weight of the\nanimals, farmers could receive nearly £500 per animal - effectively the cull cow price. The\nGovernment will bear the costs of the slaughter and destruction of the animals.\nI recognise that some producers of steers and heifers normally plan to bring their animals to\nmarket at over 30 months, and will not have had time to adjust their production systems.\nSuch animals would typically fetch significantly more than cull cows. I am pleased to\nannounce today that the Government will pay a nationally funded supplement to the basic\npremium in respect of such steers and heifers, at a rate that reflects the historic differences\nbetween cow prices and those for steers and heifers.\nThe supplement will be payable for six months, which will allow producers time to adapt their\nmarketing programmes to the new circumstances. The cost is likely to be up to £80\nmillion...the top-up will be set at no less than 25p per kilo for the first four weeks that the\nscheme is in operation.\nIn the longer run, we need arrangements to allow back on the market meat from breeds -\nspecialist breeds, for example - that often do not mature until after 30 months. Many of the\nanimals are in herds with no history of BSE. The case for exempting such animals from the\n30-month rule is strong. As a matter of urgency, my officials are working up the technical\nelements of a scheme that would allow clearly defined exemptions to be made. \nOn 3 April, I reported extensions in the coverage of beef intervention. On 12 April, a further\nwidening of the categories of intervention applicable in the UK and the removal of weight\nlimits, were agreed. For the first time, intervention on young bulls will be possible in the UK.\nMore generally, I am pursuing with food retailers and manufacturers ideas for quality\nassurance schemes to help restore confidence in British beef. As a result, I can announce that\nwe are proceeding as a matter of urgency with arrangements to improve animal identification\nand traceability. I hope to be in a position to introduce a scheme of mandatory animal\npassports for that purpose with effect from 1 June...\nAs for manufacturers, on 12 April I amended the emergency control order to allow imports\nof beef from animals over 30 months of age produced in certain third countries that\ntraditionally supply the UK, in which there is no history of BSE...I should emphasise that my\ndecision to lift the ban on imports does not apply to imports from EU countries. \nAs for the slaughtering sector, in my recent statements I have informed the House of the\nadditional resources that we are giving the Meat Hygiene Service to ensure rigorous\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n9\n HC Deb 16 April 1996 c.513 \n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\nenforcement of the rules on hygiene in slaughterhouses, especially in connection with specified\nbovine offals...\nI can announce today that I propose to introduce an aid scheme which will inject £110 million\ninto the slaughtering sector. It will consist of two elements. The first is that all\nslaughterhouses that continue to slaughter bovines will receive payment based on their\nthroughput of cattle in 1995/96. The payment will be made in two stages, with 80% to be\npaid immediately, and the remaining 20% in two months time. This assistance will replace\nthe proposal to relieve slaughterhouses from Meat Hygiene Service red meat inspection\ncharges to which we referred on 3 April. Assistance will be paid at around £8.75 for every\nbovine slaughtered during 1995/96, giving a total of £30 million to be paid under this head.\nThe second element is that the Government will introduce arrangements for purchasing and\ndisposing of the blockage, which has already been identified and audited under the supervision\nof Coopers and Lybrand. The intervention board will purchase those stocks at a valuation of\n65% of the pre-crisis market price and will take responsibility for their secure disposal. The\nboard will enter into discussions with the trade associations on the detailed mechanisms. We\nestimate that the total cost of this second aid will be £80 million, making £110 million of aid\noverall.\nOn 25 April, Mr Hogg made a statement on a possible proposal for further action.10\nPossible ways of targeting for either slaughter or movement restriction a limited number of\ncattle have been sent to the European Commission. These are designed to speed up the\nelimination of BSE from the UK herd.\nSuch a measure could only be part of a process which will lead to the lifting of the ban on\nBritish beef and beef products...\nThe main parts of the proposals are to target those cattle most likely to develop BSE by;\ntracing recorded BSE cases back to the herd of origin;\nusing farm records to find other cattle of the same age from the same herd;\neither culling, or placing movement restrictions on the defined birth cohort associated\ndirectly with BSE.\nAbout 40,000 cattle are estimated to be affected. The plan could reduce BSE by between 15%\nand 30%. This is in the context of a continuing downward trend in the incidence of the\ndisease.\nHowever, this measure did not persuade the Council of Agriculture Ministers to remove the\nexport ban. Mr Hogg reported to the House on the Agriculture Council.11\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n10\n MA FF News Release, 25 April 1996\n11\n HC Deb 1 May 1996 c.1147\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\nMy first objective at the Council was naturally to achieve action on the export ban. Progress\nwas made on this, and the conclusions of the Council explicitly recognise that the ban is\ntemporary. They also recognise that the measures already put in place and foreseen form \"part\nof a process which should allow the export ban to be progressively lifted on a step by step\nbasis.\"\nIn addition, the Council has recognised that the lifting of the ban in respect of tallow, gelatine\nand semen should be addressed in the Standing Veterinary Committee shortly. As the House\nknows, the relevant decisions are taken by qualified majority vote in the Standing Veterinary\nCommittee, not in the Council.\nOn 8 May, the European Commission stated, in a recommendation to the Standing Veterinary\nCommittee, that once strict procedures for processing animal remains were introduced in the\nUK, it would no longer be necessary to maintain a ban on exports of gelatine, tallow and\nsemen. The Standing Veterinary Committee is to consider the recommendation on\nWednesday 15 May. However, Germany has already announced its opposition to the\nrecommendation.12 \nII Reporting of the Crisis\nDuring the recent crisis, three claims have been widely made in newspapers, each suggesting\nthat the disease was the result of specific official mistakes. The first claim is that the law on\nthe content of feedstuffs for animals changed, allowing cattle to be fed on meal containing\nremains of sheep infected with scrapie. The second claim is that the disaster resulted from\nderegulation and the consequential dropping of the proposed protein processing order which\nhad been prepared in draft before the 1979 election. The third claim is that the Royal\nCommission on Environmental Pollution specifically warned against the dangers of feeding\nanimal remains to ruminants in 1979, but was ignored.\n(A) The Law on Contents of Animal Feedstuffs in the 1970s and 1980s \nThere are several regulations involved, but there is apparently not one which relaxed controls\nin a way that resulted in the outbreak. There are Regulations concerning animal feedstuffs\nfrom time to time, including two around the time of the origin of the disease:\nThe Feeding Stuffs Regulations 1982 (SI 1143); or\nThe Feeding Stuffs (A mendment) Regulations 1984 (SI 51)\nHowever, neither of these changed the law to allow the use of meat in feed for ruminant\nanimals, or in any other way apparently related to the BSE outbreak. Most of the rules are,\nin any case, derived from European Community Directives. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12\n A gra Europe, 10 May 1996 E/2\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\n(B) The Proposed Protein Processing Order and its replacement\nIn 1978 the Labour Government issued for consultation a document on Proposed Protein\nProcessing Orders.13 The purpose was explained in the introduction:\n3 The aim of the proposed controls is to prevent as far as is possible the re-cycling of salmonella\nand other disease organisms in animal, bird or fish material processed for inclusion in\nfeedingstuffs. There is growing concern about the increasing incidence of salmonella infection in\nlivestock and poultry, and of food poisoning in human beings caused by those serotypes most\nfrequently contaminating animal protein. Although it is recognised that there are other ways in\nwhich salmonella can be introduced and re-cycled, there is strong evidence to support the view that\na uniformly high standard of hygiene in the protein processing industry, both at home and in our\nimported supplies, will make a significant contribution towards the reduction of the total pool of\nthis infection.\nAll rendering plants supplying feedstuffs would have to be licensed.\n8 The Agriculture Departments would license premises when they were satisfied that, as far as\nwas practicable, (a) the method of processing was sufficient to destroy all organisms, excluding\ntheir spore forms, which may infect livestock or poultry and (b) no re-contamination of the\nprocessed product was likely to occur either in or during transport from those premises.\n9 Before the grant of a licence could be considered the premises would first have to comply with\nthe constructional and operational requirements of the order. These requirements would be set out\nin schedules to the order...Because of the variation in lay-out that in practice occurs between one\nplant and another, the likelihood is that operators would need advice on the means of complying\nwith the order. Specially trained veterinary officers would provide this advice on request once the\norder was made.\n10 The method of processing would not be laid down. It could be effected by heat, chemical or\nother means, the criterion being that the final product was free of salmonella organisms as\nindicated by the test method specified in Appendix II. Operators of plant which met the\nconstructional and operational requirements of the order would be required to submit samples of\ntheir freshly processed product to an approved laboratory to demonstrate that the product met the\nrequired bacteriological standard. \nThe Conservative Government introduced another Consultation Paper with a different\nphilosophy.14\n2 The earlier proposals were formulated on the basis that all domestic plants processing\nanimal protein for inclusion in animal feed should be licensed. Licences would be issued only\nif the process itself was capable of killing salmonellae and other disease organisms and the\nlayout, construction and operation of the processing plant were such that re-contamination of\nthe finished product was prevented. Similar standards were to be required of the imported\nproduct...\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n13\n Proposed protein processing orders, MAFF 3 May 1978\n14\n Proposed Protein Processing Order, 16 April 1980\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\n3 The new proposals reflect the wish of Ministers that in the present economic climate the\nIndustry should itself determine how best to produce a high-quality product, and that the role\nof Government should be restricted to prescribing a standard for the product and to enforcing\nobservance of that standard. Ministers take the view that this simpler approach would have\nthe incidental advantage of enabling the Industry to prepare for more stringent measures which\nmight have to be taken at some future date.\nThe resulting proposals appeared in the Diseases of A nimals (Protein Processing Order) 1981\n(SI 676). The Explanatory Note describes the measure:\nThis Order, which applies to Great Britain, enables authorised officers (as defined in the Order)\nto take for analysis at an approved laboratory samples of processed animal protein from premises\nwhere it is being produced.\nThe Order gives power to veterinary inspectors, where such analysis shows that a sample of\nprocessed animal protein does not conform with the required bacteriological standard (as defined\nin the Order), to serve a notice on the owner or person in charge of the premises from which the\nsample was taken requiring him to ensure that all animal protein produced on the premises\nconforms with this standard as from a date specified in the notice. Failure to do so will be an\noffence against the Diseases of Animals Act 1950.\nThe Minister commented on the origins of BSE in March 1996.15\nMy hon. Friend is right that it had nothing to do with deregulation. The first regulation was\nimposed in 1981. There was no regulation in the 1970s : the Conservative Government were the\nfirst to impose one. There were draft proposals but...they had to do with salmonella. In any event,\nthe temperatures contemplated in the draft regulations were wholly irrelevant to BSE because they\nwould not have deactivated it. \nThe report by the Agriculture Select Committee in 1990 on Bovine Spongiform\nEncephalopathy16 contains some discussion of changing practices in the rendering industry,\nbut the only specific criticism of MAFF rules seems to be that of a renderer who argued that\nthe Diseases of A nimals (Protein Processing Order) 1981 (SI 676) dealt merely with\nsalmonella and not with other agents which could only be killed by processing at much higher\ntemperatures.17 While this is correct, the 1981 Order did mark a tightening of rules not a\nrelaxation.\nThe generally accepted explanation for the occurrence of BSE is that it followed a change of\nprocess in the rendering industry away from the use of chemical solvents, in a process which\nrequired a high temperature to drive off the chemicals, to another continuous process. The\nlatter process did not use the chemicals, partly because of tighter regulations after the\nFlixborough explosion, and therefore did not use the high temperatures. Apparently, nobody\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n15\n HC Deb 28 March 1996 c.1238\n16\n 1989/90 HC 449\n17\n Appendix 21\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\nconsidered this to be a risk at the time. It remains obscure why this change in processes\nshould have allowed the creation of BSE. The agent is so resilient that, once created, it\ncannot be destroyed by much higher temperatures. The practice of feeding cattle with meal\nincluding items from sheepmeat was not new - although it had increased for economic reasons\nin the late seventies, relative to the use of fishmeal for a protein supplement.\n(C) The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution Warning \nSome newspapers have referred to a warning given to Ministers in 1979 over the dangers of\nspreading disease from animals through inappropriate animal feed. This was cited in the\nGuardian and in some other newspapers. However, the sentence they have quoted (in italics)\nneeds to be seen in the context of the two paragraphs in which is appears.18 Taken as a\nwhole, the passage generally endorses the use of animal remains in animal feed. It was,\nhowever, written, before the development of the prion hypothesis, the infective agent believed\nto be responsible for BSE.\n5.63 In addition to its use as a fertilizer, some animal wastes may also be recycled as an animal\nfeedstuff. The use of poultry manure as a feedstuff component is well recognised although there\nare obstacles to its full development. Poultry manure from intensive hen houses, which is virtually\nneat faeces, can be dried to provide protein which can be added to animal feedstuffs. Poultry and\npig manures are used in some parts of the world for fish food, either directly or through\ndetritivores such as worms. The recycling of poultry manure, however, has been beset with\neconomic and environmental problems. Energy used for drying may increase costs to the point\nwhere bought-in protein is cheaper. The elimination of the unpleasant smell produced during the\ndrying process may require the use of an afterburner in the drier exhaust which further increases\ncost. For this reason, poultry houses designed for natural drying may prove increasingly beneficial\nif energy costs continue to rise. Poultry litter from broiler houses can be ensiled by relatively\nsimple means, such as clamping, to provide protein material that can be used in the diet of\nruminants. The major problem encountered in this recycling process is the risk of transmitting\ndisease-bearing pathogens to stock and thence to humans (italics added). This may occur, for\nexample, when the ensiling process takes place on the farm and inadequate precautions are taken\nto ensure that pathogens are not carried to the clamp, perhaps on the wheels of vehicles.\n5.64 The Commission noted in its Fourth Report that the use of poultry manure as a cattle feed\ningredient, though distasteful to some people, represents an environmentally sound re-use of\nmaterials given that care is taken to avoid health hazards. We share the view expressed by ACAH\nthat the practice could make a significant contribution to the disposal problem and should be\nencouraged. We were informed by MAFF that high fuel costs and problems of smell nuisance had\nresulted in the closure of many plants in the UK although we do not know the relative importance\nof these two factors. To the extent that the latter is the principal cause, this would add emphasis\nto the need to find ways of controlling smell.\n \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n18\n The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, 7th Report, A griculture and Pollution, (September 1979) pp.\n149-150 \n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\nIII Why has BSE continued after the imposition of the feed\nban ?\n(A) Cows with BSE born after the feed ban\nAlthough the feed ban was imposed in July 1988, cases of BSE continue to occur. That\npartly reflects the long gestation period of the disease, but also the fact that many cattle with\nBSE were born after the imposition of the ban. Critics sometimes suggest that this proves\nthat transmission is not simply via infected feedstuff but also through maternal transmission\n(in other words mothers transmitting the disease to their offspring). However, the issue is\nmore complex and less clear-cut than it might seem.\nA PQ last October asked about the number of cows born after the feed ban19.\nMrs. Browning : The number of animals affected with BSE that were born after the feed ban\nis relatively small compared with the number born prior to the ban. As at 24 October 1995,\nthere have been 22,946 cases confirmed in animals born after the ban - or BABs - 10,689\ncases born in July to December 1988, 9,364 born in 1989, 2,425 born in 1990, 461 born in\n1991, 6 in 1992 and one in 1993 - compared with the total number of BSE cases confirmed\nto 24 October 1995 of 154,150. Of cases born after the ban, 87% are in animals born in 1988\nand 1989 when feed manufactured before the ban was still in the animal feed chain.\nA number of pieces of evidence together indicate the role of feed in transmitting infection to\nanimals born after the ban. First, the infectivity of cattle brain from animals with BSE has\nbeen demonstrated in a pathogenesis study when it is fed to calves. Secondly, the infectivity\nof rendered ruminant waste which included brain from clinically affected cattle has been\ndemonstrated in experiments looking at various rendering mechanisms and conditions. Third,\nthe case control study of BABs born after 31 October 1988 found no evidence that any\nmethods of transmission, other than feed, which was not included in the study, was occurring\nat a frequency capable of maintaining the epidemic. In particular, the study found no\nstatistically significant evidence that maternal transmission occurred. Fourthly, analysis of the\ngeographical incidence of BSE in homebred animals shows that the proportion of cases of\nBSE in the northern and eastern regions of England, where the ratio of pigs and poultry to\ncattle is greatest, has increased relative to the rest of Britain. This change is consistent with\nthe contamination of cattle feed stuffs by pig or poultry feed stuffs, or ingredients used to\nprepare them, having occurred in premises which produce both ruminant and monogastric\nrations. It was permissible to feed protein derived from specified bovine offals to non-\nruminant species until 25 September 1990.\nThe following table shows the age of cattle with BSE, clearly indicating that some were born\nnot just after the ban came into force, when a bag of old feed might have been lying around,\nbut years later.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n19\n HC Deb 31 October 1995 c.220w\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\nAge  Profile  of  Cattle  with  BSE20\nYear\nCase \nReported Age (years)\n1- 2- 3- 4- 5- 6- 7+ unknown total\n1993 0 17 1056 6268 15725 7639 2969 697 34,371\n1994 0 17 486 3642 6281 8467 4385 665 23,943\n1995 0 6 415 1539 3149 2875 4197 556 12,737\nAs noted above, the tightening of controls in August 1995 was specifically linked to the\nsuggestion \"that there has been some continued leakage of BSE infective material into animal\nfeed\".21\n(B) Studies on maternal transmission\nMaternal transmission (the mother passing the disease to her offspring) has been demonstrated\nin sheep scrapie22. It is difficult to test whether such transmission is occurring and although\nwork has been underway for some years, BSE, with its long incubation period, possible\ngenetic predisposing factors and the absence of any live test for the disease does not lend\nitself readily to study. Simple maternal transmission of a disease should be very clearly\ndistinguished from the possibility of any genetic predisposition, or even resistance, to BSE\nbeing inherited (for instance, there may be a large or slight genetic contribution to\nsusceptibility to various forms of human spongiform encephalopathies; see Library Research\nPaper 95/132, page 20). \nTwo papers have so far been published which address the issue of maternal transmission. The\nfirst23 attempted to assess all the risk factors which could be contributing to an animal\ndeveloping BSE. To do this it carried out a 'matched case control study' in which 349\nconfirmed cases of BSE born after the feed ban were compared to unaffected control animals\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n20\n Library Deposited Paper 3/2962\n21\n MAFF News Release 19 July 1995.

The potential sources of infection to which\nboth sets of animals had been exposed were compared. There was no significant difference\nbetween the affected animals and the control group when the number of cases whose mothers\nsubsequently developed BSE was considered. In other words, the mother's BSE status was\nnot a significant risk factor in determining whether the offspring subsequently developed BSE.\n  \nThere was however some association between developing BSE and being born on the day or\none to three days after a subsequently affected animal calved. While conceivably this could\nhave been caused by infection from a placenta, placental tissues have not yet been shown to\nbe infective and there was no difference in cases according to whether the placenta was\nroutinely removed from calving accommodation. The statistical significance of the association\nwas marginal so the authors considered that any evidence for a causal effect from exposure\nto subsequently affected animals at around the time of birth should be treated with caution.\nA subsequent study24 adopted two lines of approach. First, offspring born to two fathers or\n110 mothers which had subsequently developed BSE were compared, in each case, to three\ncontrol animals in the same herd, born of parents unaffected at the time of the study. There\nwas no significant difference in the incidence of BSE between the animals born to BSE\naffected parents and the controls born to unaffected parents. The authors considered that this\nconfirmed Hoinville et al's (1995) conclusion that there was no difference in the incidence\nof BSE between offspring born to parents which later developed BSE and born to those who\ndidn't. \nSecondly, the study examined correlations between BSE incidence and various risk factors\nin 2210 cases in five herds. The incidence of BSE was highly correlated with the animals'\nherd, the birth date, and the age of the animal at the most recent record, and to a lesser but\nstill significant extent with the age of the mother at birth. However, there was no significant\neffect arising from the BSE status of the mother. \nThere are some problems with this, because some of the control mothers might have been\nincubating the disease while not appearing affected at the time of the study, and there may\nalso be the confounding factor of susceptibility or resistance to BSE being inherited (see\nabove) although there is no evidence for this as yet. However, assuming that the control\nmothers were not incubating the disease, the authors found no evidence for maternal\ntransmission of BSE. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n24Curnow, RN and Hau, CM The incidence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the progeny of affected sires and\ndams.

Each pair consists of an exposed animal (an offspring of a confirmed case) and\na control calf (from the same herd and birth cohort but born to an unaffected mother over six\nyears of age). The work is due to be completed at the end of 1996 (it will take a little longer\nfor the work to be published) when all the animals have reached their seventh birthday and\nhave been slaughtered and examined for BSE. Although one statistician at the MRC\nBiostatistics Unit in Cambridge has called for the study to be unblinded now to allow its\nresults to be used for projections of future case numbers25, until all the pairs can been\nexamined on post-mortem the statistical significance of the results would be reduced26. \n  \nIV Restrictions on British Beef Exports\n(A) Countries banning British Beef Exports before the present Crisis\nThe following is a list of countries which had a ban on the importation of UK beef as of 9\nFebruary 1996.27\n(i) Ban on bone-in beef and boneless beef :\nAlgeria, Argentina, Barbados, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Guyana, Iraq, Iran, jamaica, Japan,\njordan, Kazakhstan, Libya, Lithuania, Paraguay, The Philippines, Russian Federation, Saudi\nArabia, Syria, Taiwan, UAE, Uruguay, Uzbekistan and Slovenia.\n(ii) Ban on bone-in beef\nSwitzerland\n(iii) The following countries had previously placed a ban on the export of British beef, but\nthen lifted it.\nChile, Cyprus, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, State of Sarawak (Malaysia), Mauritius, Morocco,\nOman, Qatar, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey and Tunisia.

For reasons unconnected to BSE, beef can only be\nexported from the UK to the USA, if it comes from animals slaughtered in an \"approved\nplant\". The justification for this is that the UK imports meat from countries which have foot\nand mouth disease, and the US authorities are concerned that the meat they buy should not\nbe mixed with such meat. There is no such approved plant, so no exports have been possible\nfor some years. In 1994, The British authorities persuaded the US to grant a certificate\napproving the import of boneless beef. The objective was not to start exports to the USA,\nwhich remained banned, but to use the certificate to show other countries to which the UK\nwanted to export beef that the USA would not be deterred from importing British beef\nbecause of BSE.\n(B) Countries with bans introduced since 20 March 1996\nCountry Official Ban Unofficial Ban Products\nBahrain * Beef and beef products\nBenin * Beef\nCyprus * Beef and beef products\nGabon * All consumables from UK\nHong Kong * Beef\nIvory Coast * Beef\nJapan * Beef and bovine semen\nJordan * Beef\nKorea * Beef and beef products\nKuwait * Beef\nLiberia * Beef\nMalaysia * Beef and other bovine prods\nexcl milk\nMalta * Beef\nMauritius * Beef\nMayotte * Beef\nNew Zealand * Beef\nNew Zealand * Lamb\nQatar * Beef and all meat\nSeychelles * Beef\nSingapore * Beef\nSouth Africa * Beef\nSwitzerland * Beef\nTahiti * Beef\nThailand * Beef + bovine prods except milk\n+gelatin\nTrinidad & Tobago * All beef products\nTurkey * All beef products\nYemen * All consumables from UK\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\n(C) The European Union ban on British exports of beef\nThe EU ban on British exports of beef was implemented by a Commission Decision\n96/239/EC of 27 March 1996 on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy.28 The paragraph explaining the reasoning comes in the preamble:\nWhereas, under current circumstances, a definitive stance on the transmissibility of BSE to humans\nis not possible; whereas a risk of transmission cannot be excluded; whereas the resulting\nuncertainty has created serious concern among consumers; whereas, under the circumstances and\nas an emergency measure, the transport of all bovine animals and all beef and veal or derived\nproducts from the United Kingdom to the other Member states should be temporarily banned;\nwhereas the same prohibitions should also apply to exports to non-Member countries so as to\nprevent deflections of trade;\nIn other words, the main point is the ban on exports to other EU countries. The ban on\nexports outside the EU is added on so as to enforce the internal one. In general terms, the\nban on imports by other EU Members could probably be justified under Article 36 of the\nTreaty of Rome, which follows several Articles requiring the removal of trade restrictions\nwithin the Community.\nThe provisions of Articles 30 to 34 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports,\nexports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security;\nthe protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures\npossessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and commercial\nproperty. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary\ndiscrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States.\nThe 1996 Commission decision is based on Directives concerning veterinary and zootechnical\nchecks applicable in intra-Community trade.29 Article 1 of the 1990 Directive requires\nveterinary checks. Article 10(4) - singled out for mention in the Commission Decision- reads\nas follows :\nThe Commission shall in all cases review the situation in the Standing Veterinary Committee at\nthe earliest opportunity. It shall adopt the necessary measures for the animals and products\nreferred to in Article 1 and, if the situation so requires, for the products derived from those\nanimals, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17. The Commission shall monitor\nthe situation and, by the same procedure, shall amend or repeal the decisions taken, depending on\nhow the situation develops.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n28\n 1996 OJL 78\n29\n 90/425/EEC and 89/662/EEC as amended by 92/118/EEC\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\nArticle 9 of the 1989 Directive is also singled out. Member States are required to notify other\nMember States when an animal disease has broken out, and shall take appropriate action.\nThere follows an important provision.\nPending the measures to be taken in accordance with paragraph 4, the Member State of destination\nmay, on serious public or animal-health grounds, take interim protective measures with regard to\nthe establishments concerned or, in the case of an epizootic disease, with regard to the area of\nprotection provided for in Community rules.\nOnce again, the Commission is to review the situation and to take necessary measures.\nWhether the worldwide ban is justified in terms of this legislation is something to be tested\nin the European Court, where it is being challenged both by the British Government and by\nthe National Farmers Union. The exact terms of the challenges have not yet been published.\nThe NFU challenge started with an application for judicial review in the High Court of the\nrefusal by MAFF and Customs & Excise to issue health certificates for live animals for\nexport. Since they were carrying out the instructions of the EU, it is a method of challenging\nthe Commission's power. Mr Justice Turner said that the National Farmers Union had an\n\"arguable case\" that the EU ban was illegal and ordered the case to be referred to the\nEuropean Court \"at the earliest expedient moment\".30 \nThe Government's challenge is to be under Article 173 of the Treaty of Rome. This article\nstates :\nThe Court of Justice shall review the legality of acts adopted jointly by the European Parliament\nand the Council, of acts of the Council, of the Commission and of the ECB, other than\nrecommendations and opinions, and of acts of the European Parliament intended to produce legal\neffects vis-a-vis third parties.\nIt shall for this purpose have jurisdiction in actions brought by a Member State, the Council or the\nCommission on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural\nrequirement, infringement of this Treaty or of any rule of law relating to its application, or misuse\nof powers.\nThe Court shall have jurisdiction under the same conditions in actions brought by the European\nParliament and by the ECB for the purpose of protecting their prerogatives.\nAny natural or legal person may, under the same conditions, institute proceedings against a\ndecision addressed to that person or against a decision which, although in the form of a regulation\nor a decision addressed to another person, is of direct and individual concern to the former.\nThe proceedings provided for in this Article shall be instituted within two months of the\npublication of the measure, or of its notification to the plaintiff, or, in the absence thereof, of the\nday on which it came to the knowledge of the latter, as the case may be. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n30\n Guardian, 26 April 1996\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\n(D) Do other countries have BSE as well as the UK ?\n \nThere have been very few BSE cases abroad. There have been only 16 confirmed cases in\nFrance. There have been 186 cases in Switzerland. Other cases, according to MAFF, came\nin cattle imported from the UK and their numbers are very small. The low figures are\nsurprising, particularly since the UK exported feedstuff, including some which would\npresumably have been contaminated.\nThere have been suggestions in the UK that these figures are gross underestimates but no\nevidence has been produced. It is possible that cows fall ill and die on the Continent more\noften without the farmer calling a vet. Therefore there would be no diagnosis. It is possible\nthat there is a cumulative effect whereby few cases are seen by vets who are therefore unused\nto seeing BSE cases and favour a different diagnosis.\nThere is certainly no incentive for a farmer to reveal a suspect case. In Italy compensation\nis only paid at the rate of 70% of the value of the healthy cow. In France compensation is\nsaid by the French Government to be \"generous\". However, all the cattle in the herd are\nslaughtered, which could be devastating for a dairy farmer.\nThe position remains unclear, but the discrepancy between the 16 cases in France and the\n160,000 in the UK is a gap too wide to be bridged.\nThe USA has, officially, never had a case of BSE, but this position has been challenged by\nHoward Lyman, food director of the Humane Society, the largest welfare group in the US,\nwith 2.5 million members.31\nLyman is eloquent on what he sees as, at best, an ignorance in the US government or, at worst,\na cover-up protecting the large companies with a vested interest in beef. The US may not have\nBSE, but in the light of an increasing number of farmers feeding cowmeat to cows, another bizarre\nand fatal condition has arisen.\nDowner Cow Syndrome (DCS) is the term given to the 100,000 apparently healthy US cows that\ndrop dead every year. A high proportion of these cows are ground up and fed to other cows.\nWhile none of these cows have exhibited symptoms like those in mad cow disease, researchers in\nWisconsin discovered that minks given DCS feed did so. The most crucial evidence was that\nHolstein cows whose brains were injected with \"mad mink\" brain died after 18 months of an\nencephalopathy disease. It seems obvious to Lyman that there is some kind of brain disease\ninfecting parts of the US herd. He doesn't wholly trust the US government's figures that of 2,700\nDCS cows analysed, zero had BSE. \"They realise that one case of BSE will put the entire export\nindustry at risk,\" he says.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n31\n Guardian, 27 March 1996\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\nV Possible European Compensation for BSE \n(A) Cost of BSE Measures\nThere has been some confusion as to the European contribution to the cost of BSE measures.\nSpokesmen from the European Commission have referred to the European contribution as\n70% of the cost of the measures, but the reduction in the UK's rebate resulting from higher\nUK receipts reduces the net benefit. The famous rebate achieved by Mrs Thatcher in essence\namounts to 66% of the difference between the UK's payments and receipts. The rebate is\ndeducted from the UK's VAT contribution in the following budget year. Because funding for\nthe slaughtering campaign will be classed as a UK receipt, it will have the effect of reducing\nthe UK's rebate, although there will be some mitigation from the fact that the funding will\nincrease overall EU expenditure and thus also the UK's payments. Thus, the EU can claim\nto be paying 70% of the cost, while after taking account of the rebate, the net payments are\nonly 25%.32 \nThe Government calculation was stated in reply to a PQ.33 This suggests that the net\ncontribution from the EU will be £260m out of a total cost of £1,010m in 1996/97; £140m\nout of a total cost of £740m in 1997/98; and £110m out of a total cost of £680m in 1998/99. \n(B) The removal of cattle of 30 months and more from the food chain\nAt first, the UK saw it as a temporary measure until the deboning arrangements had been\nsorted out, but Continental Ministers want the ban to continue for longer. For some\n(indeterminate) time to come, therefore, cattle aged more than 30 months will be bought by\nthe Government and disposed of in a way that does not go into the food chain. It will be a\nspecial one-off event rather than an application of a general policy already in force. It has\nbeen agreed that it should be 70% financed by the EU. The scheme opened in the week\nstarting 29 April, and offers compensation of one ECU per kilo which, depending on the\nweight of the animal, could amount to nearly £500 per animal. There is also a supplement\nfor those producers of steers and heifers who normally plan to bring their animals to market\nat over 30 months. That supplement will be payable for six months. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n32\n A gra Europe 4 April 1996 P/4\n33\n HC Deb 26 April 1996 c.321w\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\n(C) A Selective Slaughter Policy\nSome other EU agriculture Ministers would like the UK to agree to slaughter all cattle in\nherds seriously affected by BSE. That might cover herds with 5 or more BSE cases, but\nsome other number might easily be chosen. If that were to happen, it would also be a special\npolicy, and the financing arrangements would have to be decided. The 70% rule, with the\nabove qualifications, would probably apply but compensation for a whole dairy herd is more\ncomplex than that for individual animals and it is possible that the UK Government might\nwant to compensate more generously for items such as income loss than the rest of the EU.\nThat last possibility, however, is entirely speculative in a very uncertain situation. \n(D) The cull of very young calves\nThis was a scheme theoretically open since the 1992 CAP reforms. Until now, Portugal has\nbeen the only Member State to take advantage of it. Under this scheme, a payment of 120.75\nECU is made for every male dairy breed calf disposed of before it reaches the age of 10 days.\nSince this is an alternative form of EU intervention, the cost of funding should be carried\nexclusively by the EU. However, the above argument about the rebate also applies in this\ncase. The Agriculture Minister, Mr Hogg, announced that this scheme is being implemented\nand should be worth some £50 million to British farmers.34 \n(E) The Intervention Mechanism\nThis is the normal way of keeping up beef prices in times when the market price is low. \nIt might seem that the normal intervention system could be used to protect farmers from\nlosses from the crisis, but its effects are strictly limited for several reasons. Only certain\ntypes of carcass are accepted, and the UK has previously encouraged tightening of the rules\nso as to prevent wasteful spending. It operates for steers which are normally slaughtered well\nbefore 30 months. The EU Beef Management Committee has met recently and agreed\nextensions to the type of carcass acceptable to be taken into intervention, but it is still strictly\nlimited. The Committee also agreed to take 50,000 tonnes of beef into intervention in April.\nAlso, the intervention price is nowadays linked to the market price in that country. Therefore\nif the market price collapsed. the intervention price would follow it down, rather than staying\nat a fixed level and protecting farmers from the effects of the fluctuations. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n34\n HC Deb 28 March 1996 c.1233\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/62\nIn the first tender, 9,275 tonnes were accepted, of which 4,500 came from Germany, 2,500\nfrom France 1,500 from Italy and only 140 from the UK.35 In the second tender the\nremaining 40,770 tonnes were accepted. 3,965 came from the UK, 13,212 from France and\n11,155 tonnes from Germany. Of the UK figure, 2,388 (all steers) came from Northern\nIreland.36\nAccording to Richard Cracknell of Anglo British Processors, the main obstacle was the processors'\nmargin which stands at 10 ECU per head. Because of the ban on sales of specified bovine offals\n(SBOs), UK animals were worth up to £45 less than French carcases, for example. Unless the\nprocessors' margin was changed, Cracknell said, traders faced a loss. The second problem was the\nrule which required slaughterers to debone and freeze meat on the same premises. Very few UK\nslaughterers had their own blast freezers and therefore sent their carcases to cold stores to be\nfrozen, a practise which had fallen foul of intervention rules.37\nIntervention is operating partly to help the Continental beef industry, which has seen its\ndomestic market decline more than has its British counterpart. For example, in the week\nbeginning 15 April, German beef consumption was still 55% below the pre-crisis level and\nFrench 40% below, while British consumption was only 36% below.38 \nIntervention is totally funded by the EU, but appears only to offer a very limited safety net\nto the British farmer in this present situation. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n35\n A gra Europe, 12 April 1966 P/2\n36\n A gra Europe, 26 April 1996 E/2\n37\n op. cit.\n38\n A gra Europe, 26 April 1996 M/3\n25\n\n\n\n"

This paper presents up-to-date\nresidence-based unemployment rates not published elsewhere for all 651 constituencies in the\nUK, using figures for the number of unemployed claimants from the monthly count and data\nfor the economically active population from the 1991 Census of Population. \nThis month the Office for National Statistics has moved to a 1991 ward base for the\nunemployment statistics. This will mean that for many constituencies it will no longer be\npossible to make direct comparisons with previously published data. As a result, this Paper\nno longer includes a table on changes in the level of unemployment in recent years. Research\nPaper 96/63 provides a guide to the methodology and to which constituencies are affected by\nthe change in the geographical base.\nJane Dyson\nEconomic Policy Paul Mann\n& Statistics Section Statistics Resource Unit\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n                                                                   \nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not published elsewhere. These use figures for the number of unemployed\nclaimants from the monthly count and figures for the number of people economically active\nderived from the 1991 Census of Population. For the first time, the denominators used for\ncalculating the unemployment rates have been obtained from the same source, enabling\ncomparisons to be made between all constituencies in the UK.\nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour, as they take no account of peoples' ability to seek work outside the constituency\nin which they live. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nthe accompanying Research Paper 96/63.\nThe data contained in this Paper are generally not comparable with figures published in the\nprevious Papers of this series. This is because the ONS have, this month, changed the\ngeographical basis of the monthly claimant count. Previously, the monthly figures have\nrelated to parliamentary constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1981 wards. From May\n1996 onwards the figures are based on constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1991 wards.\nWhilst figures for January, February and March 1996 will be re-released on the new basis,\nback-runs of figures for dates prior to 1996 will not be published. For many constituencies\ntherefore, there will be a discontinuity in the figures at the end of 1995. For this reason it\nis no longer possible to produce tables showing the change in the number of claimants 1 year,\n3 years and 5 years ago. \nNotes to tables:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The\nfollowing abbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/64\n2. One Conservative member has resigned the party whip. Bolton North East is therefore\nshown as CON* in the tables.\n3. The published figures for both unemployed claimants and the economically active\npopulation for Bethnal Green & Stepney and Bow & Poplar are thought to contain an\nerror, due to a ward being misallocated between the two constituencies. Since the\nerror relates to both the numerator and the denominator, the unemployment rates\nshould not be significantly affected. Corrected figures should be available on June\n12th.\n4. The published data for unemployed claimants in Belfast North and Belfast West are\nknown to be wrong, due to a technical error in the allocation of claimants to\nconstituencies. In order to provide data for all 651 constituencies we have assumed\nthat claimants are divided between the two in the same proportion as in March.\nCorrected figures should be available on June 12th.\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/64\n       II   Residence-based unemployment rates by parliamentary constituency, April 1996\n             United Kingdom constituencies\n                                                 A.

          "Defamation Bill [HL], Bill 127 of 1995-96:\nLaw and Procedure\nResearch Paper 96/60\n16 May 1996\nThis paper seeks to give a brief outline of the law of defamation and to explain the main\nprovisions of the Defamation Bill [HL] which is due to have its Second Reading on 21 May\n1996. Although the paper deals mainly with the changes proposed to law and procedure in\nEngland and Wales it is pointed out where the changes affect Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nThis paper should be read in conjuction with Research Paper 96/61 which discusses\nparliamentary privilege in the context of the law of defamation and the interpretation of\n'proceedings in Parliament'.\nHelena Jeffs\nHome Affairs Section\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nSummary\nThe Defamation Bill [HL] is intended to \"simplify this complex area of law and procedure,\nand fit well with current developments in the conduct of civil litigation generally\".1\nIn brief the Bill seeks to introduce the following amendments to the law and procedure in\nactions for defamation:\n a new statutory defence to supersede the common law defence of innocent\ndissemination and to concentrate on the concept of responsibility for publication\n a new and more streamlined defence of unintentional defamation which would be\navailable to a defendant who is willing to make an 'offer of amends' (ie to pay\ncompensation assessed by a judge and to publish an appropriate correction and\napology)\n a one-year limitation period for actions for libel, slander or malicious falsehood\n a new fast-track offer of amends procedure intended to provide a prompt and\ninexpensive remedy in less serious defamation cases\n new powers for judges enabling them to dispose of a claim summarily and to grant\ndamages of up to £10,000\nThere has long been consensus on the need for reform of defamation law and procedure,\nparticularly in view of certain high awards of damages by juries and the high costs of\nproceedings. There is also a large degree of consensus on the subject matter of the current\nBill although some have questioned whether it will in fact achieve its avowed purpose of\nsimplifying and reducing the costs in defamation cases. Questions have also been raised in\nrespect of editorial freedom and the offer of amends defence and on matters not addressed\nin the Bill, such as the non-availability of legal aid in defamation cases.\nIt has, however, been argued that the most significant development in relation to defamation\nlaw and procedure was the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the Elton John libel case in\nwhich the Court decided that judges give could give certain guidelines to juries regarding the\nappropriate level of awards of damages.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 Lord Chancellor on Second Reading, HL Deb vol 570 c578 - 8.3.96\n\n\nCONTENTS\nPage\nI Defamation Law - a brief introduction 7\nA.

The tort of defamation\nLibel and slander together make the tort of defamation and actions in defamation are taken\nby persons seeking to protect their reputations. In recent years there have been a number of\ncases which have attracted a great deal of publicity, either because of the large awards of\ndamages or because the taking of legal action has been seen as a disproportionate response\nto the words complained of. The debate surrounding defamation actions, particularly libel\nactions, is very much linked to the debate about the freedom of the press to comment on\nmatters of public interest.\nThere is no single or satisfactory definition of a defamatory statement but the best known is\n\"a statement concerning any person which exposes him to hatred or ridicule\nor contempt or which causes him to be shunned or avoided or which has a\ntendency to injure him in his office, profession or trade.\"2\nLibel is a defamatory statement published in a permanent form. This obviously includes\nwritten or printed statements but defamatory statements contained in radio or television\nbroadcasts or film or theatrical productions are also treated as libel.\nSlander is publication in spoken or transient form.\nOne of the main practical distinctions between libel and slander is that it is necessary to prove\nactual monetary loss in a slander action but in an action for libel, damage is presumed. The\ndistinction between libel and slander does not exist in Scotland and the Faulks Committee3\nrecommended abolition of the distinction in England and Wales. The Committee also\nrecommended that there be a statutory definition of defamation.\nEvery libel is also a crime but prosecutions for criminal libel are rare. Slander is not of itself\na crime although the words complained of may involve the commission of a criminal offence\nby reason of their being obscene or blasphemous, for example. This paper is concerned only\nwith civil actions relating to defamation.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n2 Fraser on Libel and Slander 7th edition 1936, p.3\n3 Report of the Committee on Defamation Cmnd 5909, March 1975\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nTrials in defamation actions take place in the High Court alone. They are also unusual in that\nthey are civil proceedings in which either party is entitled in most cases to insist on trial by\njury4 and the jury decides whether the words complained of are defamatory of the plaintiff\n( ie the person bringing the action). This is an application of English legal principle that\nwhen a man's life, liberty or honour is at stake that he should have the right to be judged by\nhis fellow countrymen. In an action for defamation the judge decides whether the words\ncomplained of are reasonably capable as a matter of law as bearing a defamatory meaning and\nthe jury decides whether they are in fact defamatory. The jury also assesses the damages.\nB. Defences to libel actions\nThe main defences to libel actions are as follows:\n1. Justification - This is the truth defence. It is a complete defence that the words\ncomplained of are true and the Faulks Committee recommended that the defence should\nbe renamed 'truth'.\n2. Fair Comment - This defence is available where a statement has been made in good faith\nand without malice on a matter of public interest. It applies therefore to statements of\nopinion and not of fact. The defence must prove that the subject matter of the comment\nis a matter of legitimate public interest, that the facts upon which the comment is based\nare true and that the comment is fair in the sense that it is relevant to the facts. The\ndefence will fail where that defendant was motivated by malice.\n3. Absolute privilege - Rather than being a defence as such, absolute privilege accords an\nimmunity from suit in certain circumstances. The main circumstance in which it applies\nis proceedings in parliament even if the words complained of are false or malicious. This\nis known as parliamentary privilege.\n4. Qualified privilege - If a defendant claims qualified privilege the plaintiff will not succeed\nunless he can prove that the defendant was actuated by malice. It is impossible to set out\nall the situations in which this defence might apply but it does apply to statements made\nin performance of a legal moral or social duty (eg the provision of a character reference).\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n4 section 69, Supreme Court Act 1981\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nC. Damages in libel actions\nThe main remedy for defamation is damages although the court has powers of injunction to\nrestrain publication of defamatory matter.\nThe level of damages reflects the seriousness of the action. Contemptuous damages are\nawarded when in the opinion of the jury the action should never have been brought, either\nbecause the action is trivial or the plaintiff already had a bad reputation. These damages are\nusually the smallest coin in the realm (one penny). Nominal damages are usually only a few\npounds and are awarded when the plaintiff only wanted to clear his name or there was no\nsignificant injury to him even though he was wronged. Compensatory damages are the jury's\nestimate of the sum necessary to vindicate the plaintiff's reputation and to compensate him\nfor the injury to his feelings. Aggravated damages are awarded where the defendant has\npleaded the defence of justification but cannot establish it or where he has been actuated by\nmalice. Exemplary damages are only awarded in serious circumstances, for example where\nthe defendant's conduct was calculated to make a profit for himself which may be greater than\nthe compensation payable to the plaintiff.\nUntil recently neither the judge nor counsel for the parties could suggest a sum to the jury\nas being appropriate. The judge's direction used merely to be that the award should not be\nexcessive and that it should be fair to both sides. The problem was that the jury did not\nknow where to start and could be influenced by recent decisions reported in the press which\nmay have involved large sums of damages in different circumstances.\nHigh awards of damages by juries and inconsistencies in awards became a subject of concern.\nThe tendency for juries to award much higher levels of damages than judges has resulted in\na marked difference between the level of awards in libel cases and those assessed in judges\nin personal injuries cases.\nIt has been alleged that libel plaintiffs can sometimes profit out of the damage to their\nreputation whereas personal injury plaintiffs are barely adequately compensated for the\ndamage they have suffered. It is also alleged that high levels of damages in libel cases lead\nto \"gold-digging\" plaintiffs making trivial claims against newspapers.\nHowever, during the 1990s the Court of Appeal has made a number of decisions which have\nthe effect of allowing some guidance now to be given to juries. In Sutcliffe v Pressdram Ltd5\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 [1990] 1 All ER 269\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nthe Court of Appeal decided that the judge should give the jury some guidance in his\nsumming up as to the financial implications of the sum which might be awarded by pointing\nout the investment income from, or the purchasing power of, large sums so that the jury were\nable to appreciate the real value of such sums and to weigh any sum they had in mind to\naward. In that case, however, Lord Donaldson (then Master of the Rolls) made it quite clear\nthat awards for personal injuries could not be used as a basis for compensation in defamation\ncases. In addition, by virtue of section 8 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and rule\n11(4), Order 59 of the Rules of the Supreme Court the Court of Appeal now has discretion\nin all cases set down for trial since 1 February 1991 to substitute such sum as appears to it\nto be proper in cases where it is of the opinion that the damages were excessive or\ninadequate. Hitherto the Court of Appeal could only interfere by ordering a new trial if the\namount awarded was so great or so small that no jury could reasonably have awarded such\na sum.\nThe next major case was a case involving Esther Rantzen6 in which the Court of Appeal\ndecided that reference to awards confirmed or substituted by the Court of Appeal could be\nmade to the jury. At that time the Court rejected the argument that reference should be made\nto personal injury awards.\nIn December 1995 the Court of Appeal reduced the size of the damages award in Elton John's\ncase against Mirror Group Newspapers.7 Compulsory damages were reduced from £75,000\nto £25,000 and exemplary (i.e. punitive) damages were reduced from £275,000 to £50,000.\nIn its judgment the Court made the following decisions on guidance to juries on damages in\ndefamation cases:\n1. No reference may be made to awards by other juries in comparable defamation actions.\n2. Reference may be made to awards approved or substituted by the Court of Appeal in other\ncases can be made.\n3. Reference may be made to damages in personal injury cases.\n4. Reference may be made to an appropriate award and an appropriate bracket into which the\naward might fall.\nBoth the judge and counsel for both parties could make such references to the jury. In the\nElton John case Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, said it was \"rightly offensive to\npublic opinion that a defamation plaintiff should recover damages for injury to reputation\ngreater, perhaps by a significant factor, than if that same plaintiff had been rendered a\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n6 Rantzen v Mirror Group Newspapers [1994] QB 670\n7 John v MGN Ltd Times Law Report 14.12.95\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nhelpless cripple or an insensate vegetable\". This view is very much in line with the view of\nthe Law Commission in its consultation paper on damages for personal injury.8\nThe effect of the Court of Appeal's decision could be that an award made by a jury in excess\nof the band of figures suggested by the judge will be appealed by the defendant. A plaintiff\nwould then be likely to settle at the figure suggested by the judge rather than risk wiping out\nhis award with the cost of an unsuccessful appeal. If this is the result it could then be asked\nwhy assessment of damages should not reside with the judge. However, in a written answer\nof 22 February 1995 John Taylor, then Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's\nDepartment, said that the Government had no plans to make it the responsibility of the trial\njudge rather than the jury to determine the level of damages in defamation cases but would\nrather be introducing a new summary procedure so that the judge will have power to dispose\nof straightforward claims summarily instead of sending them to trial.9 The new summary\nprocedure is contained in Clause 8 to 11 of the current Bill and is discussed in Part III E of\nthis Paper.\nIt is possible that the Court of Appeal may eventually allow reference to be made to previous\njury awards once a body of precedent has built up under the new guidelines. Legal\ncommentators have seen the decision in the Elton John case as the most significant reform\nof defamation law in recent years and possibly more significant than anything in the current\nBill. However, the decision has rekindled some concern that the decision could encourage\nnewspapers to publish stories they know to be untrue because they might calculate that they\nwould gain more in sales than they would have to pay if sued for libel.\nIn 1989 damages of £1.5 million (the highest ever sum) were awarded to Lord Aldington in\nrespect of a defamatory pamphlet written about him by Count Nicolai Tolstoy Miloslausky.\nOn July 13 1995 the European Court of Human Rights ruled10 that the size of the award\ntogether with the lack of \"adequate and effective\" safeguards against such a size of award\ngave rise to a violation of the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article 10 of\nthe European Convention on Human Rights. The decision in the Elton John case and the new\nprocedures in the current Bill may have addressed the violation of the European Convention\nto some extent. In the absence of a further case there cannot, however, be any certainty that\nthese reforms would be sufficient to satisfy the European Court of Human Rights.\n     \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 Damages for Personal Injury: Non-Pecuniary Loss Law Commission Consultation Paper No 140, December 1995\n9 HC Deb vol 225 c204W - 22.2.96\n10 Case No 8/1994/455/536, Times Law Report 19.6.95\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nD. Legal aid\nLegal aid is not available to either party to take or defend defamation proceedings.11 The\nview was taken as long ago as 1967 by a joint committee of the Law Society and the Bar\nCouncil that it is unjust that the poor cannot defend their reputations. This view was\nendorsed by both the Faulks Committee12 and the Royal Commission on Legal Services.13\nSection 58 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 empowers the Lord Chancellor to\nspecify by order proceedings in which lawyers can enter into conditional fee agreements with\ntheir clients. However, the Conditional Fee Agreements Order 199514 does not include\ndefamation proceedings. Thus defamation proceedings remain out of reach for most people.\nHowever, one of the factors which might militate against enabling defamation proceedings\nto be brought within the scope of conditional fee agreements is the difficulty for lawyers in\nassessing whether the words complained of will be taken as defamatory by the jury and so\nin assessing their own risk under the agreement.\nThe lack of funding for taking defamation proceedings is said to lead to an inequality between\nplaintiffs and defendants who tend to be well-off businesses. However, legal aid is not\navailable to defendants in defamation cases either and it is said that this can lead to a rich\nplaintiff issuing a \"gagging writ\" to silence a less well-off defendant. The question of\n\"gagging writs\" is discussed in Part IV A of this Paper.\nThe new summary procedure proposed in the current Bill (see Part III E of this Paper) is\nintended to lead to reduced costs but there is no proposal to introduce legal aid for such cases.\nIn a written answer of 26 March 1996 Jonathan Evans, Parliamentary Secretary, Lord\nChancellor's Department said that it was not the Government's intention to extend the scope\nof legal aid to libel cases.15\nIn a letter to Lord Bethell of 19 March 199616 the Lord Chancellor said that \"successive\ngovernments have taken the view that the outcome of such cases [i.e. defamation cases] is\nuniquely difficult to foresee and that even if the general mechanisms against unmeritorious\nproceedings could be strengthened in some way, they would still not provide an effective\nsafeguard against the potential waste of public money\". He also pointed out the possibility\nof an individual who qualifies financially being entitled to receive legal advice and assistance\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n11 Part II, Schedule 2 of the Legal Aid Act 1988\n12 Cmnd 5090, March 1975\n13 Cmnd 7648, 1979 (the \"Benson Report\") Section 58 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990\n14 SI 1995/1674\n15 HC Deb vol 274 c541W - 26.3.96 \n16 Library location Dep 3/5064\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nunder the legal aid Green Form scheme for preliminary matters, such as initial advice and\nobtaining counsel's opinion. \nE. Malicious falsehood\nAn action for malicious falsehood (or injurious falsehood) covers those statements which are\nfalse but not defamatory because they do not touch the reputation of the person concerned.\nFor example it is not defamatory to wrongly publish a statement that a person is retired but\nan action could be brought for malicious falsehood if there has been financial loss to the\nperson concerned and malice on the part of the defendant. Anticipated reduced costs of the\nsummary procedure could mean that plaintiffs of moderate means might be able to consider\ntaking proceedings in respect of a defamatory statement.\nII Background and Introduction to the Bill\nIn its 1992 General Election Manifesto The Best Future for Britain the Conservative Party\nstated its intention to simplify the law relating to libel in the light of the recommendations\nof the Neill Committee and, in particular, to introduce an offer of amends defence.17\nThe Defamation Bill [HL]18 was introduced in the House of Lords on 8 February 1996. It\nis intended to give effect to recommendations made by a working group of the Supreme Court\nProcedure Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Neill, to improve defamation\npractice and procedure. It seeks also to make other reforms to the law of defamation. The\nBill, as originally introduced in the Lords, was the result of three consultation exercises by\nthe Lord Chancellor's Department and of additional consultations in Scotland and Northern\nIreland. The most recent consultation took the form of the publication of a consultation paper\nand a draft Bill by the Lord Chancellor's Department in July 1995.19\nOn Lords Second Reading the Lord Chancellor said:20\n\"The Bill represents a useful measure of law reform. It will, I believe,\nsimplify this complex area of law and procedure and fit well with current\ndevelopments in the context of civil litigation generally\".\n    \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n17 p.25\n18 Bill 127 of 1995/96\n19 Reforming Defamation Law and Procedure: Consultation on Draft Bill, Lord Chancellor's Department July 1995\n20 HL Deb vol 570 c578 - 8.3.96\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nLord Williams of Mostyn set out in that debate the interests he thought were involved in\ndefamation law:21\nA number of diverse interests are involved here\nand there cannot be a perfect reconciliation of\nthem. The first is the right to privacy in personal\nand family life. That is insufficiently regarded, if\nat all, in our law. Its protection under the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights finds no\nadequate reflection in domestic law. The second is\nthe right to freedom of speech and expression. The\nthird is the English vice-not the usual one but the\nmore important one-of obsessive secrecy for no\nuseful purpose. One recalls the recent debate in\nyour Lordships' House on Lord Justice Scott's\nReport and reflects how much a Freedom of\nInformation Act is needed in this country.\nThe fourth is the public's right to know. We are\nlamentably lacking in any details of information,\nexcept on the occasion of the report to which I\nreferred a moment ago, of what those do who are\nset in authority above us. The fifth is the\ninequality of arms in this area of law. There is no\nlegal aid for libel or slander though, curiously, by\nan anomaly, there is for malicious falsehood.\nPrivate people who are wounded and defamed act,\nby and large, at their own expense except for those\nwho have a union or professional association to\nsupport them. It is worth bearing in mind that\ndefendants in this field are normally financially\npowerful corporations.\nOverarching all of this is something which I\nsuggest is too easily forgotten and overlooked,\nnamely, the sense of the very bitter and continuing\nwound that is caused to a man or woman who is\nwrongly defamed. Often that wound is much\ngrosser and graver to the plaintiff in question than\na physical injury.\nIII The Main Provisions of the Bill\nIt is important to note the specific legal meanings imported to the word \"publication\",\n\"publish\" and \"statement\" in the Bill. By clause 18(1) \"publish\" and \"publication\" are\nintended, in relation to a statement, to have the meaning that they have for the purposes of\nthe law of defamation generally (i.e. communication to a third party). However, \"publisher\"\nis specifically defined for the purposes of clause 1 (see Part III A2 of this Paper). \"Statement\nis intended to mean words, pictures, visual images, gestures or any other method of signifying\nmeaning.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n21 c579\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nA. Responsibility for Publication - the 'innocent dissemination' defence\n1. Background to the Defence and Proposals for Reform\nOn 15 February 1990 the Lord Chancellor announced that he intended to issue consultation\npapers inviting views on proposals to modify specific aspects of the substantive law of\ndefamation, including the problems of those who use advanced technology and innocently\ndisseminate defamatory materials.22 A consultation paper23 was published in July 1990\nseeking views on modifying the current rules which apply to the defence of innocent\ndissemination.\nThe cause of action (ie the right to issue legal proceedings) in libel arises from the\npublication rather than the writing of defamatory matter. Publication has a specific legal\nmeaning and in its 1990 consultation paper the Lord Chancellor's Department said:\n\"Technically there may be a separate actionable publication at every link in the chain of\ncommercial production and distribution, starting with the publication by the author to the\npublishing house, then the publishing house to the printer, the printer to the distributor, and\nso on\". It continued:\nThere will not necessarily have been a publication of a libel by every person who has\nparticipated in the process. An important distinction has developed between the primary\nparticipants, such as the writer, and newspaper company, the book publisher and the printer,\non the one hand and on the other hand, participants who only play a secondary role in the\ndistribution system. The primary participants are all fully responsible for the material they\npublish and they cannot evoke the defence of innocent dissemination. Those who are\nconsidered only to have a secondary role in the distribution of the material, such as carriers,\nnewsagents, booksellers and libraries are entitled, if it be the case, to claim that they did not\nknow, and were not negligent in not knowing of the defamatory content of the distributed\nmaterial. This is known as the defence of innocent dissemination. It is not a complete\nimmunity, but it is a fundamental defence, which enables the innocent disseminator to deny\nthat there has been any publication of the defamatory material by him. The defence is not\navailable to a distributor who was aware of the libellous content or who ought to have known\nabout it, so that his lack of knowledge amounts to negligence on his part.\nThe possibility of extending the defence to printers was considered by both the Committee\non the Law of Defamation (the \"Porter Committee\") which reported in 1948,24 and the\nCommittee on Defamation (the \"Faulks Committee\") which reported in 1975.25 However the\nCommittees came to rather different conclusions. Although the Porter Committee appreciated\nthe practical difficulties for printers in knowing whether or not the matter they were required\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n22 HL Deb vol 515 c1532-3WA - 15.2.90\n23 Defamation: The Defence of Innocent Dissemination, Lord Chancellor's Department, July 1990\n24 Cmd 7536 (1948)\n25 Report of the Committee on Defamation Cmnd 5909, March 1975\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nto print was libellous they took the view that printers had a number of means available to\nthem to protect themselves financially against the risk involved. The Faulks Committee,\nhowever, did recommend the extension of the defence to printers although they did\nunanimously reject the printers' plea for complete immunity from suit. \nThe case for extending the defence has centred on the unreasonable burden that is placed on\nprinters who may be proceeded against in circumstances where they have no knowledge or\nnegligence; freedom of expression for authors who might find it difficult to get their work\npublished if they could not afford to indemnify the printer against loss; the introduction of\nnew technology which does not involve the printer in any familiarisation with the content of\nthe work to be printed. \nThe case against extending the defence remains that put forward by the Porter Committee:\nit is open to the printer to protect himself from liability by checking the material to be\nprinted, taking out insurance or seeking an indemnity from his customers.\n2. The Bill\nClause 1 seeks to create a new statutory defence which would supersede the common law\ndefence of innocent dissemination. Such defence would be available to distributors, printers\nand others who do not have primary responsibility for a defamatory publication, provided that\nthey neither knew nor had reason to believe that their acts contributed to the publication of\ndefamatory material. Clause 1 seeks to concentrate on the concept of responsibility for\npublication and would extend throughout the United Kingdom. \nClause 1(1) seeks to offer a defence to a person who is not the author, editor or publisher\nprovided that he took reasonable care and neither knew or had reason to believe that he was\ncausing or contributing to the publication of a defamatory statement.\nAuthor, editor and publisher are defined in subsection 2.\nAuthor is defined as the originator of a statement, but not including a person who did not\nintend any publication of his statement (eg a person whose private diary is published without\nhis consent).\nEditor is defined as a person having editorial or equivalent responsibility for the content of\nthe statement or the decision to publish it.\nPublisher is defined as a commercial publisher, whose business is issuing material to the\npublic or a section of it, and who publishes the statement in the course of that business. This\nis a narrower meaning than the word would normally have in the context of defamation and\nclause 18(1) confines that meaning to its use in this clause.\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nSubsection 3 is drafted so as to exclude in effect from the definition of author, editor or\npublisher such people as printers, producers, distributors, booksellers; those processing,\nmaking copies of, distributing or selling a film or sound recording or recordings made on any\nother electronic medium; broadcasters of live programmes who have no effective control over\nthe maker of a defamatory statement; operators or providers of access to communications\nsystems by means of which a defamatory statement is transmitted or made available who\nhave no effective control over the person sending or making available the statement (eg\nInternet providers).\nIt has been suggested that the \"no effective control\" requirement in relation to Internet\nproviders could create an anomaly as those providers who seek to act responsibly and provide\nsome control over the content of their system might not come within the scope of the defence\nwhereas those who do not attempt to control material would come within the scope of the\ndefence26. However it is possible that the courts will take the view that those who refuse to\nadopt a sensible policy towards policing their networks will be deemed to have \"reason to\nbelieve\" that they are publishing defamatory material. There is, however, no requirement in\nthe Bill for Internet providers to remove material found to be defamatory from their systems\nnor does the Bill clarify when and where a publication has taken place when computer\nnetworks are used. In relation to the latter point Lord Inglewood, Parliamentary Under-\nSecretary at the Department of National Heritage, said on Lords Second Reading that the\nconsultation on the July 1995 draft Bill had revealed strong views in favour of legislation in\nthis area but that the Government did not think it right to attempt legislation without full\nconsideration and consultation on all policy issues arising in the context both of defamation\nlaw and diverse other areas of law relevant to the use of those networks.27\nSubsection 3 also seeks to give the courts a discretion to decide by analogy with the excluded\ncategories whether a person is to be considered the author, editor or publisher of a statement.\nThis allows for the possibility of including within the scope of the defence people who in the\nfuture might use new technologies for printing, selling etc which are not currently available.\nBy subsection 5 the court would be required to have regard to the following matters in\ndetermining whether a person took reasonable care or had reason to believe that what he did\ncontributed to the publication of a defamatory statement (ie in determining whether the\ndefence should operate in relation to those to whom it may apply):\n(a) the extent of his responsibility for the content of the statement or the decision to\npublish it,\n(b) the nature or circumstances of publication, and\n(c) the previous conduct or character of the author, editor or publisher.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n26 Limiting Libel -Gazette 21 February 1996\n27 HL Deb vol 570 c605 - 8.3.96\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nSubsection 5(c) would mean that a person who comes within the scope of the defence should\ntake care in their dealings with those who have been involved in previous defamation actions\nor who could be liable to make potentially defamatory statements.\nSubsection 6 seeks to confine the operation of this defence to causes of action arising after\nit comes into force.\nOn Lords Second Reading Lord Lester took the view that it was desirable for the defence of\ninnocent dissemination to be statutorily defined and extended to cover a wider class of\nsecondary publishers (eg distributors and printers)28. However he took the view that Clause 1\ndoes not adequately protect secondary publishers and would be likely to encourage increased\nand unnecessarily complicated litigation. In Committee he introduced an amendment which\nsought to bring Clause 1 into line with the common law defence of innocent dissemination\nwhere a secondary distributor is protected if he has no knowledge of the publication\ncontaining a defamatory statement. He said:29\n It is certainly desirable for the defence of innocent\ndissemination to be statutorily defined and to be\nextended to cover a wider class of secondary\npublishers; that is, distributors, printers and others.\nThe problem with Clause 1 as it stands, however,\nis that it does not contain a wholly accurate\nformulation of the elements of the existing common\nlaw defence of innocent dissemination.\n An individual libels someone else when he\npublishes in permanent form to a third person\nwords or matter containing an untrue imputation\nagainst the reputation of that person. At common\nlaw, secondary distributors can rely on the defence\nof innocent dissemination provided that they did\nnot know that the publication contained the libel\ncomplained of and did not know that the\npublication was of a character likely to contain a\nlibel and that such want of knowledge was not due\nto any negligence on their part. Consequently, it is\nthe current practice of large newsagents, aware that\nmany of the publications they sell contain\ndefamatory statements, to seek and obtain\nreassurance that there is no libel risk because there\nis every reason to believe that these statements are\ntrue.\n Yet the defence of innocent dissemination, as it is\nset out in Clause 1, would, as I understand it,\nexclude from its protection those who were aware,\nor ought to have known, that the material they were\nhandling was merely defamatory whether or not its\npublication was defensible. This, I believe, would\nhave important implications for the large\nnewsagents I have mentioned. Once they have\ndiscovered a defamatory statement in one of the\npublications they distributed, they would be denied\nthe protection of the defence of innocent\ndissemination regardless of any steps that they\nsubsequently took to assure themselves that the\nstatement was true and that its publication was not\ntherefore libellous. If I am right, that would have\nthe unfortunate effect that it might encourage\nnewsagents, booksellers and libraries to keep their\neyes shut and remain ignorant of the contents of the\npublications they carry.\n This amendment seeks to bring the defence of\ninnocent dissemination in Clause 1 into line with\nmy understanding of the common law defence. I\nbeg to move.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n28 HL Deb vol 570 c584 - 8.3.96\n29 HL Deb vol 571 c213-4 - 2.4.96\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nIn reply the Lord Chancellor said:30\n  Clause 1 is intended to provide a defence for\nthose who have unwittingly provided a conduit\nwhich has enabled another person to publish\ndefamatory material. It is intended to provide a\nmodern equivalent of the common law defence of\ninnocent dissemination, recognising that there may\nbe circumstances in which the unwitting contributor\nto the process of publication may have had no idea\nof the defamatory nature of the material he has\nhandled or processed.\n The amendment proposed by the noble Lord\nwould, in effect, create an entirely new defence. It\nwould give a defence to a person who was indeed\naware, or on notice, that he was contributing to a\ndefamatory publication, but nevertheless chose to\ndo so. It would allow him to rely on his own\njudgment as to whether there might be some other\ndefence in the event of the defamed person taking\nproceedings, and have the effect of presenting him\nwith a real defence because he thought, however\nwrongly, that he would be able to rely on some\nother defence.\n It is imperative that we do not lose sight of the\neffect on plaintiffs of giving a defence to those who\nhave in fact been instrumental in bringing material\nwhich has defamed the plaintiff to its audience.\nThe effect in practice may be to deprive the\nplaintiff of any cause of action to remedy the\nwrong which he has suffered and which he would\nnot have suffered had it not been for the link in the\nchain of publication provided by the contributor\nwho escapes liability because of this defence. That\nmay happen when the originator of the defamatory\nstatement is impecunious or cannot be found.\n That is an important point which I stressed when\nI consulted on the question of whether it was right\nfor a defence of this nature to be available to\nprinters. That had been recommended by the\nFaulks Committee in 1975, and the response to my\npublic consultation persuaded me that it was right.\n  However, the Faulks Committee had concluded\nthat it would be wrong to make the defence an\nabsolute defence absolving distributors from any\nresponsibility in any circumstances, for, broadly the\nreasons I have sought to explain. I believe that the\nreasoning of the Faulks Committee, and the public\nresponse to my consultation, justifies some\nbroadening of the categories of defendant to whom\nthis defence may be available beyond those to\nwhom the common law defence of innocent\ndissemination might have been. But in my\nsubmission it would not be right to deprive a\nplaintiff of his cause of action against a defendant\nwho was aware that he might be wronging the\nplaintiff and misjudged the plaintiff's chances of\nsucceeding in a defamation action. Unlike the\ndefamed plaintiff, those who may participate in the\npublication of a libel can protect themselves from\nthe consequences by taking care, by taking\nindemnities or by taking out insurance against\nliability.\nThe Lord Chancellor was supported by Lord Williams of Mostyn and Lord Lester said that\nhe was persuaded by the Lord Chancellor's arguments and that they shared the common aim\nof seeking to achieve in the Bill a fair balance between the rights of plaintiffs and defendants.\nThe amendment was withdrawn.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n30 c214-5\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\n3. Extent\nThis clause would apply in all three jurisdictions of the United Kingdom.31\nB. Offer of Amends Defence\n1. The Bill\nSection 4 of the Defamation Act 1952 contains a little used defence of unintentional\ndefamation. Clauses 2 to 4 of the present Bill seek to replace this defence with a new\ndefence of offering to make amends. It would be available to a defendant who offered to\nmake amends by publishing a correction and apology, and by paying such compensation (if\nany) as is agreed by the parties or as assessed by the judge where there is no agreement. The\ndefence would not succeed if it is shown that the defendant knew he was or that he might be\ndefaming the plaintiff.\nThis new defence is intended to be simpler and more streamlined than the section 4 defence\nand to provide a more realistic opportunity for defendants to recognise and make up for the\nharm they have done.32 The availability will not be limited to defendants who can prove\npositively that the publication was \"innocent\": state of mind would be irrelevant unless the\nplaintiff shows that the defendant knew or had reason to believe that the published statement\nwas false or defamatory.\nThis new defence would implement a recommendation of the Neill report33 that such a\ndefence should be enacted to enable defendants, where they recognise that the plaintiff has\nbeen defamed, to curtail proceedings by making such an offer including a willingness to pay\ndamages assessed by a judge.\nThe offer of amends defence together with the new summary procedure (see Part III E of this\npaper) together seek to make defamation actions more speedy and less costly.\nThe provisions in the current Bill relating to the defence differ slightly from those contained\nin the draft Bill34 to take into account the responses that indicated a need to make special\nprovision for those cases where a defendant conceded that he was wrong and was prepared\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n31 Clause 19\n32 p4, Notes on Clauses for the Lords proceedings, Lord Chancellor's Department March 1996\n33 section VII, Report on Practice and Procedure in Defamation July 1991\n34 contained in Reforming Defamation Law and Practice Lord Chancellor's Department July 1995\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nto offer amends, but was not prepared to do so on the basis that amends might be ordered to\nreflect a more seriously defamatory meaning than he considered his statement could have.\nClauses 2 to 4 would now allow the defendant to specify the defamatory meaning for which\nhe is willing to make amends, so that his offer is limited to that meaning and he can defend\nthe plaintiff's claim insofar as the plaintiff contends that the statement has some other\ndefamatory meaning.\nClause 2 seeks to define an offer of amends and set out the circumstances in which it can be\nmade or withdrawn. By subsection 1 the offer could be made by a person who has published\na statement alleged to be defamatory of another. By subsection 2 it could be made in\nrelation to statement generally or it could be a qualified offer made only in relation to a\nspecified defamatory meaning which is accepted by the defendant making the offer.\nSubsection 3 would require the offer to be in writing, to be expressed as an offer under the\nsection and to state whether it is a qualified offer and if so to specify the defamatory meaning\nin relation to which the offer is made. \nThe Offer\nSubsection 4 sets out what would constitute an offer of amends. It would be an offer to do\nthe following:\n(a) to make a suitable correction of the statement complained of and a sufficient apology\nto the aggrieved party\n(b) to publish the correction and apology in a manner that is reasonable and\npracticable in the circumstances, and\n(c) to pay to the aggrieved party such compensation (if any) and such costs as may be\nagreed or determined to be payable.\nOffers may be accompanied by an offer to take specific other steps but in order to be an offer\nof amends it must also be an offer to do all those matters listed above. \nMaking and Withdrawing the Offer\nSubsection 5 seeks to make it clear that a person who has served a defence to the\nproceedings cannot then make an offer of amends. This is because an offer may be made\nonly where the defendant accepts that he has defamed the other party. However the defendant\ncould make the offer any time before or after a writ is issued against him provided that it is\ndone before he serves a defence on the plaintiff. \n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nSubsection 6 seeks to allow for an offer to be withdrawn at any time before it is accepted.\nIf he then wished to renew that offer then it would be treated as a new offer. \nAccepting the Offer\nClause 3 sets out the proposed effects of accepting an offer of amends.\nBy subsection 2 acceptance by the plaintiff of an offer would stop the defamation\nproceedings although a plaintiff would still be entitled to enforce the offer. \nBy subsection 3 where the parties agree on the steps to be taken in fulfilment on the offer\nthe aggrieved party would be able to apply to the court to make an order enforcing that\nagreement. By subsection 4 where the parties do not agree on the steps to be taken by way\nof correction, apology and publication, the party who made the offer would be able to take\nsuch steps as he thought appropriate; in particular he would be able to make the correction\nand apology by a statement and apology in open court in terms approved by the court and\ngive an undertaking to the court as to the manner of their publication. \nBy subsection 5 if the parties cannot agree on the amount of compensation then the court (ie\na judge, rather than a jury35) would be able to determine the level of compensation on the\nsame principles as damages in defamation proceedings. Similarly the court would be able to\naward costs in the absence of agreement between the parties on the same principles as costs\nawarded in court proceedings.36 When determining compensation the court would be required\nto take account a number of matters and is given power to reduce or increase the amount of\ncompensation accordingly. Those matters are:\n(a) any steps already taken in fulfilment of the offer\n(b) the suitability of the correction if it has not been agreed by the parties\n(c) the sufficiency of the apology \n(d) whether the manner of the publication of the correction and apology was\nreasonable in the circumstances\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n35 clause 3(10)\n36 clause 3(6)\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nThe intention is then that the parties would normally seek to reach agreement on the details\nof what the defendant must do to fulfil his offer to the satisfaction of the plaintiff, with\nfurther recourse to the court only where no agreement can be reached.\nSubsections 7 to 9 seek to prevent the acceptance of an offer from affecting any cause of\naction against another person in respect of the same publication except in so far as the maker\nof an offer might be required to pay a contribution to any other person found liable in relation\nto the publication of the defamatory statement. However the maker of an offer could not be\nrequired to contribute more than the amount of compensation payable under the terms of the\noffer of amends.\nFailure to Accept an Offer of Amends\nClause 4 seeks to set out the consequences for the plaintiff of not accepting an offer of\namends which is still open (ie has not been withdrawn). The unaccepted offer would amount\nto a defence to any claim based on any defamatory meaning admitted in the offer. However,\nby subsection 3, the offer would not amount to a defence if the plaintiff could show that the\ndefendant knew or had reason to believe that the statement referred to the plaintiff and was\nboth false and defamatory of him. An offer of amends could then only be a defence in\nrespect of unintentional defamation unless the plaintiff has not been able to reverse the\npresumption contained in subsection 3 that the defendant did not know or have reason to\nbelieve otherwise.\nBy subsection 4 the maker of an offer of amends would not be obliged to rely on that offer\nby way of defence but if he did so then he could not rely on any other defence. In any event\nthe fact of the offer could be relied on by the defendant in mitigation of damages if he were\nsubsequently unsuccessful at trial.\nLords Debates on the Offer of Amends\nThere had been some concern about Clauses 2 and 3 as drafted in the original Lords Bill\nwhich gave the court power to determine the form and manner of publication of a suitable\ncorrection and apology where the parties could not agree. In Committee, Lord Lester moved\nan amendment, later withdrawn, which initiated a debate on the power of the court to\ndetermine the form of fulfilment of an offer of amends.37 He noted the concerns of\nnewspapers and other media organisations about the proposals to give the court a power to\nspecify the terms and the timing of the apology both in relation to the offer of amends and\nin relation to the summary procedure. This was seen as interfering with editorial freedom and\nthe concerns were also shared by Lord Williams of Mostyn who pointed out that it would be\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n37 HL Deb vol 571 c222ff - 2.4.96\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nwrong to force an editor or a broadcaster to include an apology that was not wholeheartedly\nmeant as this could vitiate the value and the effectiveness of the offer of amends procedure.\nLord Lester said:38\nIn my view, the Bill rightly seeks in Clauses 2 and\n3 to remove the obstacles to the successful\noperation of unintentional defamation by means of\nthe new defence of offer of amends. That is\ngreatly to be welcomed. The new streamlined\ndefence would provide a welcome means of\nreducing unnecessary litigation while vindicating\nthe plaintiff's good name provided that the\nprocedure was used in practice. The conditions\nnecessary to bring the defence into operation have\nbeen amended and that too is welcome. However,\nthe power of the court to make orders dealing with\nthe prominence and wording of apologies and\ncorrections in default of agreement between the\nparties has not been amended. It is the continued\ninclusion of that power which is unwelcome to\nmost broadcasters and newspaper editors.\nI shall explain why that matters a great deal. An\neditor or broadcaster confronted with the ultimate\nprospect of being ordered to give an apology or\ncorrect a prominence which he felt was not merited\nwould be most unlikely to be willing to make an\noffer of any kind. Rightly or wrongly, the\nthreatened loss of editorial sovereignty would be\ntoo great. If that is right, the defence will again be\nlittle used in practice. If any evidence is needed\nfor that one only has to look at the editorial in\ntoday's copy of The Times.\nThe amendment would alter the focus from an offer\nto publish an apology or correction to an offer to\njoin in the making of a statement in open court.\nThe power of the judge would be confined to ruling\non whether what was said in open court was\nsuitable and efficient as an apology. The statement\nwould come to the attention of the public\nvindicating the reputation of the plaintiff in two\nways. First, the Press Association is, as a matter of\nroutine, present in court when defamation\nproceedings are disposed of by a statement in open\ncourt. The outcome of the hearing is then wired to\nnewspapers and periodicals. Secondly, if the\ndefendant were a newspaper or a broadcaster its\nrespective code of practice would require it to\nreport the outcome of the action. The code of\npractice of the Press Complaints Commission\nrequires, for example. that a newspaper or outcome\nof an action for defamation to which it has been a\nparty.\nClause 2 as it currently stands would allow for a\ndegree of judicial encroachment of a coercive kind\nthat would be regarded as too coercive to make the\noffer of amends procedure likely to be attractive in\npractice. My amendment seeks to make the\ndefence of offer of amends workable for both\nplaintiffs and defendants and to strike a fair balance\nbetween their competing interests. I beg to move.\nIn reply the Lord Chancellor said:39\nI agree that there is a problem in relation to forcing\nan apology from someone who does not wish to\nmake an apology. I certainly do not wish to do\nthat and we have tried to meet the point in the\nwording of Clause 9. It states:\n\"If they cannot agree on the content, the court may\ndirect the defendant to publish or cause to be\npublished a summary of the court's judgment\nagreed by the parties or settled by the court in\naccordance with the rules of court\".\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n38 HL Deb vol 571 c223-4 - 2.4.96\n39 c225\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nThat is intended to deal precisely with the situation\nwhere a party does not wish to apologise because\nhe believes that he was right in the first place but\ncannot prove it. Therefore, he is likely to have\nbeen found liable but does not wish to make an\napology. Therefore, we have substituted for an\nenforced apology a judgment of the court on the\noutcome to be agreed by the parties or, failing\nagreement, to be settled by the court. I believe that\nthat deals with that point.\nI have read carefully, as I always do, the leaders in\nThe Times. I have thought about the ITN\nbroadcasts which will start with a \"bong\". I have\nnot yet heard one of those but I am sure that The\nTimes will anticipate the future in a way that I\ncannot. However, I do not believe that this\namendment deals with that point. We have not yet\nreached the amendment which deals with that point.\nThe answer to the \"bong\" editorial, if I may call it\nthat, is to be found at the third paragraph of Clause\n9(2), which states:\n\"If they cannot agree on the time, manner, form or\nplace of publication, the court may direct the\ndefendant to take such reasonable and practicable\nsteps as the court considers appropriate\".\nThe use of the words \"reasonable\" and \"practicable\"\nare intended to guard against the scenario which\none finds in the leader in The Times.\nOf course, it is possible to take the view that the\ncourt would act unreasonably or impracticably, but\nI am not prepared to take that view. The judges\nwould take account of the particular conditions set\nout in Clause 9. However, this amendment does not\ndirectly address those matters and therefore I\nshould have thought that it restricts the scope of an\noffer to make amends. I cannot see why it needs\nto take the restricted form which the amendment\nproposes. An essential element of the offer, which\nhas been accepted, would be missing if the parties\nwere unable to agree. \nThere is a question of precisely what the\nformulation should be. I should be the last to want\nto have a system which would not work for one\nreason or another. So far I have accepted the\nessence of the point made by the noble Lord, Lord\nWilliams of Mostyn, and have tried to deal with it\nin the form of words which I used in Clause 9(2).\nIt may be that something more needs to be done.\nI shall be happy to consider that because I want this\nto work. It is a question of whether it needs to be\nrestricted to a statement in open court.\n(NB The Times editorial40 had suggested that the Bill as originally drafted could lead to\napologies being given undue prominence, for example by being the opening headline on ITN's\nNews at Ten.\nLord Hoffman questioned whether there really would be an erosion of editorial freedom:41\nIt is only the most doctrinaire view of editorial\nfreedom which will seriously object to a newspaper\nsimply having to publish a summary of the\njudgement. The right to make a statement in court\nwhich the newspaper can ignore is perfectly\nuseless. I know that my noble friend Lord Lester\nsays that there is a code of practice relating to those\nmatters, but we have some experience of what\nhappens to codes of practice in this area. You may\nas well allow the victim to go out and proclaim his\ninnocence to the passers-by in the Strand. The only\nproper remedy is to bring what the judge considers\nto be the truth to the attention of the same people\nwho saw the original libel.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n40 Lords of Libel - Times 2.4.96\n41 c226\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nIf that is thought to be an invasion of editorial\nfreedom, one should remember that that is part of\na larger package. First, there is the limitation of\nsummary damages to £10,000. I should not like to\nsee that limit increased to £25,000, as the noble\nLord, Lord Lester, suggests, because £25,000 is\nquite a large sum of money. It is important to\nmake it clear that the summary remedy is intended\nfor people who are not primarily interested in\nmoney.\nSecondly, the other part of the package is that\nnewspapers have the advantage of using the\nsummary procedure as a cheap way to get rid of\ngold-digging claims. All that I have heard from\neditors and newspaper lawyers suggests that they\nregard this as a useful weapon. The amendment in\nthe name of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, would\ngive them all the advantages of the summary\nprocedure with virtually no concession on their part\nto the rights of libel victims. I do not believe that\nthat is fair.\nLord Lester returned to the subject of judicial control over the published prominence of\napologies on Report.42 He said that the net effect of this would be that a newspaper editor\nor broadcaster faced with the ultimate prospect of being compelled to publish an apology or\ncorrection with a prominence which he considers was not merited would be most unlikely to\nbe willing to make an offer of amends. In reply the Lord Chancellor said that he had initiated\ndiscussions with various representative of the media to see if a solution could be found which\nwould allow not only for the public recognition of the defamation in a particular case but also\nfor a published recognition of it.43\nOn Third Reading the Lord Chancellor successfully brought forward amendments to Clauses\n2 and 3 which modified the offer of amends procedure to try and meet those concerns. He\nsaid:44\n As I said at Report, it seems to me that the\ndramatic examples which have been given to\nillustrate why the media would be reluctant to offer\namends in provisions do not reflect the likely\nreality of their operation. Nevertheless, we are all\nanxious to see that the new procedure will achieve\nthe desired result, that where a person has been\ndefamed, and the mistake is acknowledged, a\nsystem of speedy and voluntary amends should\nbecome the recognised conventional path to choose\nto resolve differences which might otherwise\ninvolve the parties in protracted and expensive\nlitigation. This is something which may not happen\nif there is a general reluctance to come forward and\nmake offers, even if that reluctance is attributable\nto what we would consider to be an unnecessarily\ncautious approach. As I said, I wish to reach the\nbest possible solution to this problem. We want to\nencourage maximum use of the offer machinery,\nprovided, of course, that its use will lead to\neffective amends being made to those who have\nsuffered defamation.\nEffective amends is the whole purpose and centre\nof the provisions. It involves not merely\nacknowledgement of the wrong but an attempt to\nundo the wrong which has been done. It is\nessential that the person who has done the wrong\nshould be willing to, and should, take steps which\nwill achieve that aim. It is in both parties' interests\nthat the wrong should be righted as quickly as\npossible and as inexpensively as possible. In most\ncases, therefore, there is likely to be agreement as\nto the amends which will be appropriate.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n42 HL Deb vol 571 c628ff - 16.4.96\n43 c631\n44 HL Deb vol 572 c20-21- 7.5.96\n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nBut inevitably there will be some cases in which,\nalthough the parties are agreed in principle, they are\nunable to agree the exact steps to be taken. That\nmay be because the offeror is not willing to\napologise in terms which would be acceptable to\nthe wronged party and which the court would\nconsider reasonable or he is not prepared to give\nhis withdrawal a prominence which the wronged\nparty considers proportionate to the prominence of\nthe original published wrong; or it may be that the\nwronged party is making unreasonable demands.\nOnly the court can judge in a particular\ncircumstance which is the case. This is where I\nhave modified the provisions. I believe that it\nwould be wholly appropriate for the court to judge\nthose matters and to make an order accordingly, so\nthat the package awarded to the person who\naccepted the offer will reflect the full amends that\nhe is entitled to expect when he accepts the offer-\nno more and no less.\nIt may be that a very limited publication is apt. It\nmay be that the money element in the package, if\nany, would be very small. Nevertheless, it has\nbeen represented to me that there is a very real fear\namong the media that, if they made offers, orders\nmight occasionally be made against them in terms\nwhich differed very radically from what they had\ncontemplated when making the offer. It is\nsuggested that while there was any such risk offers\nwould not be forthcoming. Of course, the media\ndo not have the exclusive privilege of being at the\nreceiving end of libel claims, and this procedure is\nnot designed for their exclusive use. But it is\nimportant that those who are defamed by the media\nshould not be deprived of the benefit of it because\nof the reasons which I have outlined. I have,\ntherefore, sought an accommodation to vary the\nprovisions which will apply when the parties cannot\nagree the details in such a way as to preserve the\ncore of the amends package while removing that\nelement which was seen as a serious disincentive to\noffering amends; namely, that offers might rarely,\nif ever, be made.\nThe amendments now proposed to Clauses 2 and 3\nmaintain the emphasis on the need for appropriate\npublicity being given to the correction and apology.\nBut if the parties fail to agree those details, the\ndefendant must take his chances on the basis of his\nbest offer. The details of his best offer-as to\nwording and manner of publication-will be\nscrutinised by the court. If the court thinks that the\nplaintiff's demands for more were unreasonable, the\nposition will be much the same as if the court had\nmade an order coinciding with the best offer. If,\nhowever, it falls short of what the court considers\nto be adequate, that will be reflected in the money\ncompensation.\nOne possibility which did concern me was that an\noffer of amends might be made as something of a\ntactical ploy by a person who had no intention\nwhatever of righting the wrong in the manner\ncontemplated by the provisions and whose \"best\noffer\" might even exacerbate rather than amend the\noriginal wrong. It is an established principle of\ndefamation law that conduct after the original\npublication may be taken into account in the\nassessment of damages, whether that conduct shows\na will to make good or determination not to do so.\nI have taken great care, therefore, to ensure that\nthat principle is clearly manifested in the\nprovisions. If it appears that an offer has been\nmade hypocritically, that may indeed sound in the\ncompensation. That, I think, will discourage any\nattempt to abuse the new machinery.\nThe amendment was supported by Lord Williams and Lord Lester who said that it met the\nthe legitimate interests of the media while preserving the core of the offer of amends\nprocedure.45 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n45 c23\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nA further matter of concern that arose during the Lords debate in relation to the offer of\namends was the timing of the offer.\nIn Committee, Lord Williams of Mostyn sought to introduce an amendment which would\nhave allowed a defendant to make an offer even after the serving of another defence. He\nargued that a newspaper may not discover that it had made an erroneous statement until after\nthe close of pleadings or the exchange of witness statements which would then be too late to\nmake an offer of amends.46 He was supported by Lord Lester. The Lord Chancellor replied\nthat the purpose of Clauses 2 to 4 was to encourage a defendant who has published a\ndefamatory statement to make speedy reparation to the wronged plaintiff. He took the view\nthat time is allowed for the defendant to make the necessary investigation so as to decide\nwhether to enter a substantive defence or to make an offer of amends and that to accept the\namendment could take away all sense of urgency and fail to provide the plaintiff with prompt\namends.47\nLord Williams returned to this matter on Report48 and again the Lord Chancellor expressed\nmore fully his argument as to why he was not prepared to accept the amendment:49\nThe special machinery provided in Clauses 2 to 4\nis neither needed nor intended as a substitute or\nalternative formal procedure for cases that have\nreached the stage of defences having been lodged.\nIt is designed to provide immediate amends\navoiding all the trouble and expense of\nconventional proceedings where the defendant\ncomes forward at once ready to minimise and make\nup for the harm he has done. This has advantages\nfor both sides in achieving a mutually satisfactory\noutcome quickly and cheaply. The plaintiff knows\nthat proper amends will be made without his having\nto go through an action, and the defendant knows\nthat the steps which he will have to take once he\nhas committed himself to an offer will be\nreasonable.\nThe question is why the machinery should not be\nmade available to cut short proceedings which have\nalready gone further down the line, since the lack\nof immediacy could be reflected by a larger award.\nThere would, I think, be dangers in this. If we try\nto give the same advantage to the honourable\ndefendant who has been misled by his sources or\nadvisers as to those who have immediately admitted\ntheir wrong, advantage could also be taken by those\nwho were less \"honourable\" and simply did not\nbother to make appropriate inquiries before\ndeciding to contest the claim or saw the machinery\nas a useful fall-back to guarantee that they would\nnever have to face a full trial even if the plaintiff\nwas not intimidated by the pleaded defences.\nIt was suggested on the previous occasion-and I\nthink it is implicit in what was said tonight-that\ndefendants may need more time to make their\ndecisions before lodging defences. Of course there\nwill be flexibility in that. A defendant who has had\ntime to decide to contest the claim on the basis of\na particular defence has also had time to make the\ninquiries on which that decision is based.\nHowever, it is right to consider the interaction\nwhich this new machinery will have with the new\nprovisions for summary disposal. Under Clause 10\nthere is an express power to make special rules as\nto summary disposal. These may include\nmodification of the rules usually governing the\ntimetable for serving pleadings and authorising the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n46 HL Deb vol 571 c227 - 2.4.96\n47 c228\n48 HL Deb vol 571 c633ff - 16.4.96\n49 c634-5\n29\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\ncourt to require a defendant to elect, at or before\nthe summary disposal hearing, whether to make an\noffer to make amends. In practice, therefore, the\ndefendant may have rather longer to make his\ninquiries and make his election than if the standard\ntimetable applied.\nTherefore I believe that there is an opportunity in\nthe procedures which we are introducing to give\ndefendants a longer time to make their decisions\nthan perhaps exists at the present moment. I\nbelieve that is a better type of flexibility to\nintroduce than to allow this procedure to be used\nafter defences have been lodged, when it is a\nprocedure which is really designed to avoid the\nnecessity of a case going that far. I hope that that\nwill meet the type of flexibility that is asked for,\nand that therefore the noble Lord will feel able not\njust to withdraw his amendment but to feel\nreasonable in that the point is properly dealt with.\nLord Williams remained unconvinced but withdrew his amendment.\nIn Committee Lord Williams of Mostyn also addressed the question of lack of jury\ninvolvement in the offer amends procedure. He sought to introduce an amendment so that\nthe proceedings where there has been an offer of amends should be determined by a judge\nalone (rather than by a jury) only with the agreement of both parties.50 He argued that judges\nwere \"notoriously mean\" in assessing damages in personal injuries cases and that this could\nprejudice plaintiffs. The Lord Chancellor replied that the offer of amends procedure is\ndesigned to encourage the parties to come to their own agreement and to keep costs down.\nHe expressed the view that a defendant may not even contemplate making an offer of amends\nif it would mean entering a commitment to pay whatever sum and take whatever steps a jury\nmay decide on.51 The amendment was withdrawn.\n2. Extent\nThe offer of amends defence would apply throughout the United Kingdom.52\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n50 HL Deb vol 571 c230 - 2.4.96\n51 c230-1\n52 clause 19\n30\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\n3. A Press \"Right of Reply\"\nThe offer of amends provisions in the Bill have some points in common with the campaign\nwhich has been fought for some years to legislate for a statutory right of reply in the media.\nThe Bills introduced by Frank Allaun each year from 1980 until he retired at the general\nelection of 1983, the bills presented by Austin Mitchell in 1984, by Ann Clwyd in 1987-88,\nby Tony Worthington in 1988-89 and finally Clive Soley in 1992-93 unsuccessfully sought\nto provide for the right to seek correction of factual inaccuracies. The phrase \"right to reply\"\ntends to suggest a right to respond to misrepresentation or unfair comment and some of the\nearlier bills proposed such a right. They were later restricted to the correction of factual\ninaccuracies\nOne of the factors which led to the setting up of the first Committee under the chairmanship\nof Sir David Calcutt QC was the strength of support for the bill introduced by Tony\nWorthington in 1988-89. The report of the Committee on Privacy and Related Matters53 set\nout the arguments of principle about the need for a statutory right of reply to rectify\ninaccuracies which are not necessarily libellous: \n11.4 Two arguments of principle compete in this area. On one side is the argument that\nany requirement upon the press to publish any matter at the instance of another party restricts\nits freedom and opens the door to abuse. A statutory right of reply as contemplated in the Bill\ncould be invoked to compel an editor to publish material that he did not believe to be true or\neven knew to be false. The impression might be given that the editor accepted that the\noriginal story had been incorrect. This could lead to readers being misled into believing that\na complainant had been given a clean bill of health, though the editor considered this\nunjustified. By contrast, in defamation actions, even if a case against a newspaper is proved,\nthe court cannot force an editor to acknowledge his error in print. Indeed the newspaper might\nnot even report the outcome of the case.\n11.5 On the other hand, it is argued that any person who is inaccurately described or\ncriticised in the press should be entitled to have the inaccuracy corrected. Since the press has\nfailed to provide a sufficient remedy of its own volition, a statutory right should be created.\nSuch a right would enhance individual freedom by allowing a person to respond. The ability\nof the press to publish stories would be no more limited than under the law of defamation.\nIn assessing these competing arguments we have been conscious that there is no necessary\ncorrelation between the publication of an inaccurate story about an individual and an intrusion\ninto his privacy. Nevertheless, there is sometimes an overlap which justifies our considering\na possible right of reply alongside other remedies.\n11.6 We have borne in mind that statute already provides for a limited right of reply,\nwhich is little known and rarely used in practice. Under section 7 of the Defamation Act\n1952, it is provided that newspaper reports of certain meetings (for example public meetings\nor those of local authority committees) are protected by qualified privilege, but only \"subject\nto explanation or contradiction\". In other words, the newspaper will lose the privilege if it\nfails to afford the complainant a reasonable opportunity to contradict the defamatory allegation.\nSignificantly, however, the editor is not required to accept the complainant's reply as accurate\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n53 June 1990, Cm 1102\n31\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nor to present it to his readers as established fact. Moreover, any such proposed reply would\nhave to be reasonable both as to length and content.\nThe Committee concluded:\n11.14 We think it right that an individual who is the subject of a seriously inaccurate story\nshould be able to seek a correction and an apology. We also consider that there is an onus\nupon the press, if it wishes to retain public confidence, to set the record straight whenever\npracticable and, moreover, to give any such correction due prominence. Where the facts are\ndisputed it would generally be appropriate for the newspaper to publish instead a reasonable\nletter from the individual or organisation concerned.\nHowever they did not recommend the introduction of a statutory right of reply, and\nconsidered that the problem should be tackled within the ambit of a code of practice or under\nthe law of defamation according to the circumstances of each individual case. They proposed\nthe setting up of a new Press Complaints Commission to operate along the lines of the\nBroadcasting Complaints Commission to provide, on a non statutory basis, an effective means\nof redress for complaints against the press. The Press Complaints Commission came into\nbeing in 1991 and articles 1 and 2 of their code of practice set out the responsibilities of the\nprint media:\n1. Accuracy\n(i) Newspapers and periodicals should take care not to\npublish inaccurate, misleading or distorted material.\n(ii) Whenever it is recognised that a significant\ninaccuracy, misleading statement or distorted report\nhas been published, it should be corrected promptly\nand with due prominence.\n(iii) An apology should be published whenever\nappropriate.\n(iv) A newspaper or periodical should always report\nfairly and accurately the outcome of an action for\ndefamation to which it has been a party.\n2. Opportunity to reply\nA fair opportunity for reply to inaccuracies should be\ngiven to individuals or organisations when reasonably\ncalled for.\nSome newspapers have a regular place near the front of the paper where any corrections are\nto be found.\n32\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nComplaints about unjust and unfair treatment in broadcasting may be made by those directly\naffected to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, which the current Broadcasting Bill\nproposes to amalgamate into a new Broadcasting Standards Commission to deal with all\ncomplaints about broadcasting. This body will be permitted to decide not to consider a\ncomplaint if the person affected has a remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law.\nC. Limitation Period for Defamation Actions\n1. Background\nLimitation rules exist to protect defendants by bringing certainty to legal proceedings and\npreventing old and stale claims from being resurrected. \nIn England and Wales at present the limitation period (ie the time period in which an action\ncan be brought) for libel and slander cases is three years by virtue of section 4A of the\nLimitation Act 1980.54 The limitation period was previously reduced from six years to three\nyears by the Administration of Justice Act 1985 thereby enacting one of the recommendations\nof the Faulks Report55. This is one of only two of the Faulks Report recommendations to\nhave been introduced to date. \nThe current three year period does not however constitute on absolute \"statute-bar\" as section\n32A of the Limitation Act 1980 allowed an action to be brought with the leave of the High\nCourt if it was brought within one year from the earliest date on which the plaintiff knew all\nthe facts relevant to the cause of action, but only if all or any of the facts relevant to the\ncause of action had not become known to him until after the expiration of the three year\nlimitation period. The effect of this is, therefore, that a plaintiff who discovers the\npublication after the three year limitation period expires is in a better position than a plaintiff\nwho discovers the publication just before the end of the three year period as he must\nnevertheless act before the period actually does expire.\nThe current limitation period for malicious falsehood actions is six years which is the\nlimitation period applicable in causes of action in tort generally.56\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n54 as amended by section 57(2) of the Administration of Justice Act 1985\n55 op cit\n56 section 2, Limitation Act 1980\n33\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nIn its consultation paper on the draft Bill57 the Lord Chancellor's Department stated that the\nmain purpose of a defamation claim is to repair the damage done to the plaintiff's reputation\nand that that should be done quickly to be effective.58 It proposed therefore a reduction in\nthe limitation period to one year with a discretion given to the court to allow actions to be\nbegun later if in all the circumstances that would be fair. The view was also taken that the\nlimitation period for malicious falsehood actions should be the same as for defamation actions\nas the same facts could give rise to both types of action. This would implement one of the\nmajor recommendations of Lord Justice Neill's working group on the practice and\nrecommendation in defamation.59\n2. The Bill\nClause 5 seeks to reduce the limitation period in actions for libel, slander and malicious\nfalsehood arising after the section comes into force to twelve months. However the court\nwould be given a general discretion to disapply the limitation period if in all the\ncircumstances that would be equitable. In particular the court would be required to have\nregard to the length of, and the reasons for, the delay on the part of the plaintiff; when the\nfacts became known to the plaintiff and the promptness of his action on becoming apprised\nof those facts; and the effect of the delay on the availability and cogency of relevant evidence.\nIn its consultation paper on the draft Bill the Lord Chancellor's Department gave examples\nof reasonable grounds for delay, including where the plaintiff has tried to avoid litigation by\nseeking a remedy under an alternative form of dispute resolution, or where the viability of\nhis claim depended on the outcome of other pending proceedings such as a criminal\nprosecution or disciplinary proceedings affecting the reputation which the plaintiff is seeking\nto protect.60\nClause 5 forms part of the general emphasis in the Bill on the speedy and effective resolution\nof defamation claims.\nOn Lords Second Reading, Lord Williams of Mostyn expressed concern about the effect on\nplaintiffs of the reduction of the limitation period.61 He said that despite the proposed\ndiscretion to allow the courts to disapply the time limit where it would be equitable to do\nplaintiffs could be constrained by the one year period and that the one year period does not\noffer an incentive to defendants to retain documents beyond that period although a claim\ncould later come to light. Lord Williams introduced an amendment at Committee Stage\nwhich sought to require the court to take into account the conduct of the defendant after the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n57 op cit\n58 para 4.3\n59 Section VIII Report on Practice and Procedure in Defamation, July 1991\n60 para 4.4\n61 HL Deb vol 570 c580 - 8.3.96\n34\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\ncause of action arose and in particular his response to the plaintiff's requests for information.\nHe said:62\nMy fundamental objection to Clause 5 is that it is\nwrong to take away a plaintiff's right, subject to\nexceptions, to the three-year period in respect of\nlimitation. Amendment No. 30 includes a further\nrelevant protection for a plaintiff who, if Clause 5\nbecomes Section 5 of the Act, may need further\nprotection.\n Perhaps I may make one or two general\nobservations. If I stand on the pavement outside\nthis House and am run over by the Evening\nStandard delivery van, I do not understand why I\nshould have three years in which to claim in respect\nof my broken leg; but if another newspaper\ndefames me, perhaps wounds my life more\nfundamentally than the break of my leg would\nrepresent or imply, I have only the one year. I\nknow it will be said that there are exclusions. I do\nnot see why there should be any reason in principle\nthat a plaintiff should be limited to one year.\n There is no legal aid for plaintiffs. Many plaintiffs\nare private individuals. Very often a plaintiff will\nwant to take action-for instance, if he is a doctor or\na member of a profession which is subject to an\ninternal complaints machinery. Very often a\nplaintiff will have to save quite strenuously to\nafford the costs. If no legal aid is available, there\nis normally an inequality of arms between\ndefendants, who tend to be well off, and plaintiffs,\nwho, if they are not a member of a union or a\nprofessional organisation, are not well off.\n Despite the explanations given on an earlier\noccasion it seems to me that there is no proper\nreason to limit the limitation period to 12 months in\nrespect of false material published which is\ndefamatory as opposed to the personal injury\nexample that I gave earlier.\n I recognise, of course, that there are exceptions.\nBut the court will tend to be rigid if the experience\nof the Limitation Act in personal injury cases is any\nguide. For the convenience of the Committee, I\nhave sought to address the matter generally. I beg\nto move.\nIn reply the Lord Chancellor said:63\nClause 5 implements one of the major\nrecommendations made by Lord Justice Neill's\nworking group; and I need not remind the\nCommittee of the depth of experience which\nresided in that group.\n I think that I discern a difference between the\nsituation in which, unfortunately, the noble Lord\nhad his leg broken by a newspaper van and in\nwhich he was defamed either by that newspaper or\nanother. The injury by defamation is an injury\ndone at the time, and the sooner it is corrected the\nbetter for everyone. In so far as the injury to the\nbroken leg heals, that is well and good. But the\nsubstitution of damages, which is the remedy,\ndepends a good deal on how the injury turns out.\nOne might hope that the injury would heal quickly\nand that so good and so straight would be the result\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n62 HL Deb vol 571 c233-4 - 2.4.96\n63 c234-5\n35\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nthat one would hardly notice the difference as the\nnoble Lord walked on in his brilliant career. In\nthat case the damages would be somewhat reduced.\nTherefore, a three-year period of limitation for\npersonal injuries seems reasonable in regard to\nthese circumstances.\n However, as the Neill group said, in its experience\nit would be in only the most exceptional cases that\na plaintiff could be justified in delaying for more\nthan a year before starting defamation proceedings.\nThat is the result of a great deal of experience. I\nthink that all of us agree that the sooner these\nactions are taken the better for reasons of freshness\nof evidence and the like.\n Looking at the law of limitation generally, I cannot\nanticipate what the Law Commissioners may say,\nfor example, on the law of limitation on personal\ninjuries.\n As regards Amendment No. 30, we put the\nmeasure into the Bill as published for consultation.\nFollowing consultation, and in response to many\ncomments on the clause, it was modified so that\nfewer examples of \"all the circumstances of the\ncase\" to which the court might need to have regard\nwere provided. The basic and essential provision\nis that the court shall have regard to all the\ncircumstances, which was not the case under the\nprevious legislation. Although the reason for and\nlength of delay will always be relevant, and lack of\nknowledge will often be, it is clearly not possible to\nidentify all the kinds of circumstances which could\nconceivably in any case be relevant for\nconsideration.\n Moreover, it was pointed out in consultation that\nthe inclusion of a specific example could raise two\nexpectations which it should not do. One possible\nexpectation was that a plaintiff who could show\nthat his case fell within that example must succeed.\nThat is clearly not right if it is just an example of\na matter which could affect the exercise of the\ndiscretion. The reason that we took that out in the\nfinal form of the Bill as laid before the Committee\nwas in order to avoid those difficulties.\n My answer on the main point is that there is an\nessential difference between the cause of action in\ndefamation and the cause of action in personal\ninjuries. The accumulated experience of the Neill\nCommittee was in favour of, and recommended as\na central recommendation, the limitation to 12\nmonths. The discretion should be a completely\nopen one and particular examples are on the whole\nunwise.\nLord Williams withdrew the amendment but said that he could see no difference in principle\nbetween a person who suffers personal injuries and another who suffers injury to his\nreputation. He returned to the subject at Report Stage by introducing an amendment to delete\nClause 5 from the Bill. The Lord Chancellor gave a fuller explanation of the reasoning of\nthe Lord Justice Neill's working group in recommending the reduction in the limitation\nperiod:64\n My Lords, I have always found some difficulty\nabout limitation generally. There is always a\nquestion about precisely what purpose it serves and\nwhat the principle should be on which it should\nproceed. A good deal of concern has gone into that\nsubject matter over the years. The more I have\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n64 HL Deb vol 571 c638-9 - 16.4.96\n36\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nseen of detailed provisions of limitation, the more\ncomplicated they look.\n The amendment would amount to the rejection of\none of the major recommendations by Lord Justice\nNeill's working group-namely, that the limitation\nperiod both for actions in defamation, and actions\nfor malicious falsehood, should be reduced to one\nyear, but that there should be a discretion to extend\nthe period. Therefore there is in the Bill, in this\nsituation, a completely open discretion to extend the\nperiod.\n I have considered quite carefully, in particular in\nrelation to some of the examples that the noble\nLord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, gave last time,\nwhether the discretion should be in some way\nelaborated so as to indicate what might be done in\nparticular situations. However, I have concluded\nthat that would be unwise. On the whole, judicial\ndiscretion in this area without any circumscription,\nwould be the right answer. I am comforted in the\nview that that is correct when I consider the\nattempts made to limit judicial discretion in other\ntypes of limitation. They produce tremendous\ncomplexity and metaphysical distinctions of\ncomparative fineness.\n The recommendation of Lord Justice Neill's\nworking group was made after careful consideration\nof the reality and all the issues arising in\nconsidering the time limits which should apply to\ndefamation proceedings. Your Lordships will\nremember that the personnel of the working group\nwere extremely experienced in this area of the law.\nThe group pointed out that only in the most\nexceptional circumstances could a plaintiff be\njustified in delaying for more than a year before\nstarting proceedings. It is almost always in his own\ninterest to do so as soon as he knows that he has\nbeen defamed. If he acts at once, his action can\nminimise or even prevent any substantial damage,\nwhich is why he has a cause of action, and\npresumably why he chooses to take proceedings.\n This is very different from a personal injuries\nclaim, where it may not immediately be apparent to\nan injured person that his injury is attributable to\nsome other person's fault, and his action, however\nprompt, cannot halt, minimise or prevent the injury:\nindeed it may be impossible to assess the\ninexorable long term effect of the injury. It is\nright, therefore, to require particularly swift action\nas the norm in defamation cases.\n The group gave examples of circumstances (other\nthan the plaintiffs lack of requisite knowledge\nduring the running of the limitation period) which\nwould justify extension. The present law allows\nextension only in the narrow case of when the\nplaintiff in defamation (not malicious falsehood) did\nnot acquire the relevant knowledge until after the\nperiod had expired. Thus this clause is in two\nways more generous to plaintiffs than the old ones,\nsince the strict limitation rule may be relaxed, for\ninstance, in favour of a plaintiff who only acquired\nthe requisite knowledge at the eleventh hour, or a\nplaintiff who had some other good reason for not\nstarting proceedings within the period prescribed.\n In my submission, the balance of a very ample\njudicial discretion is the answer in relation to those\ncases where there is a special reason for not taking\naction within the year. I therefore think that it is\nright that your Lordships should give effect to the\nrecommendations of the Neill Committee having\nregard to the reasons which it has given and which\nI have sought both to summarise and to elaborate.\nAlthough Lord Williams remained unconvinced he withdrew the amendment.\n37\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\n3. Extent\nClause 6 would make similar provision for Northern Ireland. \nThe current Bill does not reduce the limitation period for Scotland and so it will remain at\nthree years by virtue of the Law Reform Miscellaneous Provisions (Scotland) Act 1985. It\nhas been suggested65 that as most newspapers circulate and radio and television broadcasts\ntake place within both jurisdictions this would give a plaintiff two years more to issue\nproceedings in Scotland than in England and Wales. It could be said, then, that the intention\nof providing speedy resolution of claims could be undermined for potential defendants. \nD. Rulings on the Meanings of Statements\n1. The Bill\nClause 7 seeks to prevent parties from seeking preliminary rulings on whether statements\nare \"arguably capable\" of bearing particular meanings. This implements the recommendations\nof Lord Justice Neill's working group on the meaning of words.66\nIn Reforming Defamation Law and Practice, the consultation paper on the draft Bill, the\nreasons for seeking to institute this change were explained as follows:67\n5.1 Where an action for defamation is tried with a jury, it is for the jury to decide the\nmeaning of the words complained of. But the decision as to whether the words are\ncapable of bearing a particular defamatory meaning is reserved to the judge, and he\nwill withdraw from the jury any meaning, contended by the plaintiff, which in the\njudge's opinion a reasonable man could not understand the words to bear. There used\nto be no special interlocutory procedure for early disposal of that issue, which was\nusually left to the trial, but the defendant could apply to strike out the claim on the\nbasis that it was not arguable that the words complained of were capable of bearing\na meaning defamatory of the plaintiff.\n5.2 Following a recommendation in the Neill Report, the Rules of the Supreme Court\nhave been amended so that, under Order 82 rule 3A, either party can now apply for\nan order determining whether or not the words complained of are capable of bearing\na particular meaning or meanings attributed to them in the pleadings (i.e. whether the\nwords can have that meaning, as opposed to whether that meaning could be\ndefamatory). The judge may dismiss the claim if it appears to him that the words are\nnot capable of bearing those meanings.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n65 Law changes 'will hit Scots media' - Scotsman 30.10.95\n66 section II, Practice and Procedure in Defamation July 1991\n67 chapter 5\n38\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\n5.3 It is therefore quite pointless for the court to go through the additional stage of\nconsidering whether those words are arguably, as opposed to actually, capable of\nbearing particular meanings. The old \"arguably capable\" test is no longer needed, but\nclause 6 expressly provides that the court shall not be asked to rule on it. This\nrecognises that the old test has been superseded, and may not be used as a delaying\nor other tactic.\nNB Clause 6 of the draft Bill was identical to Clause 7 in the present Bill\nOn Lords Second Reading the Lord Chancellor said that Clause 7 was \"part of a lesser\nreform, designed to eradicate delaying tactics by parties going through the unnecessary stage\nof applying for rulings as to meanings which statements are \"arguably\" capable of bearing\".68\n2. Extent\nClause 7 would apply to England and Wales and Northern Ireland.\nE. Summary Disposal of Claims\n1. Background\nCurrently defamation actions cannot be dealt with by summary judgment under Order 14 of\nthe Rules of the Supreme Court which allows the court in other civil cases to dispose of a\ncase summarily on the basis that there is no arguable defence to the plaintiff's claim.\nHowever in the late '80s Mr Justice Hoffman (now Lord Hoffman) drafted a Bill seeking to\nintroduce a summary procedure in defamation cases in recognition of the fact that plaintiffs\nin libel cases often desired a quick and easy way to clear their name and a swift public\nstatement correcting the false statement. This point was also made in the recent Commons\ndebate on the costs of libel cases initiated by Peter Bottomley.69 It was also thought that\nnewspapers would like to have a summary procedure for the disposal of trivial 'gold-digging'\nclaims.\nLord Hoffman's proposals had three objectives:\n1. to give plaintiffs the opportunity to obtain an immediate correction, coupled with a\npayment of a relatively small sum in compensation\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n68 HL Deb vol 570 c 577 - 8.3.96\n69 HC Deb vol 272 c557ff - 22.2.96: see Peter Bottomley at c557 and Edward Garnier at c558 \n39\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\n2. to give defendants the opportunity to dispose quickly and cheaply of relatively trivial\nclaims\n3. to encourage both parties to put their cards on the table as soon as possible, with a view\nto achieving early settlement\nThe proposal was to provide for a form of summary procedure in suitable defamation cases\nunder which a judge could decide the issue and award damages not exceeding £5000. It was\nalso proposed that the judge would be able to order the publication of an apology or\ncorrection. There would be no jury in such cases.\nThese proposals were considered by Lord Justice Neill's working group in their report on\nPractice and Procedure in Defamation of July 1991. The report noted the similarities\nbetween the proposal that a judge should be able to order the publication of an apology or\ncorrection in such place and form and at such time as the judge may direct and the\nWorthington Right of Reply Bill of 1988/89. The working group stated that it agreed with\nthe view of the Calcutt Committee in its report on Privacy and Related Matters70 that it would\nbe undesirable that there should be a power to compel an editor to publish either a correction\nor an apology in terms unacceptable to him. It expressed the view that the proposals could\nforce an editor to publish something which he may not believe or even which he knows to\nbe false (without being able to prove it under the rules of evidence).71\nIn addition the working group expressed doubts about the desirability of a judge being\nempowered to determine the meaning of words without the parties necessarily consenting to\nhis doing so. It took the view that as long as jury trial is retained in defamation cases then\na party should not be deprived of the opportunity of jury trial without his consent. The group\npointed to the difficulty in determining what was a 'trivial' case and doubted whether there\nwere many cases that would fit into the criteria for summary relief. \nThey also expressed the view that the proposed scheme would lead to an increased rate of\nappeals involving additional cost and delay.72 The working group believed that many of the\nproblems the proposals sought to address could be remedied by the implementation of their\nown recommendations on the abolition of the rule in Scott v Sampson (see Part III G of this\nPaper) and for an 'offer of amends' defence (see Part III B of this Paper) and recommended\nthat Mr Justice Hoffman's proposals for a summary procedure should not be introduced.73\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n70 Cm 1102 1990, para 11.4\n71 para XVII.3\n72 para XVII.14\n73 section XVII\n40\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nOn winding up the Second Reading debate in the Lords, Lord Inglewood said that the revised\nprovisions in the present Bill overcame the general criticisms of the summary procedure as\noriginally drawn and that Lord Justice Neill was content that his concerns had been met.74\nTo an extent the summary disposal provisions presage Lord Woolf's civil justice reform\nproposals contained in his interim report to the Lord Chancellor on Access to Justice75. In\nthat report he made proposals for a fast track procedure for simple and straightforward civil\ncases beyond the small claims limit. He hopes that this will provide access to justice for\nlitigants of limited means and ensure equality of treatment between litigants if they are of\nunequal means. these issues are important in defamation cases given that there is no legal\naid for libel actions and that plaintiffs often face newspapers etc of much larger means at their\ndisposal for the payment of legal costs.\nThere remains some concern, however, that the summary procedure might perversely result\nin increased costs and complicate rather than simplify libel actions. On Lords Second\nReading Lord Lester said that the matter needed to be looked at carefully to ensure that the\n\"fast-track\" did not become \"gridlock\".76\nFor others the proposed procedure does not go far enough. For example, on Second Reading\nLord Alexander of Weedon, a former chairman of the Bar Council, said:\n In some ways, I should have liked to see the Bill achieve a slightly less\nmodest result than that so clearly described by the noble and learned Lord,\nLord Hoffmann. I remember the end of one hot July at the conclusion of\na libel case which I had found exacting and which, I think, even my\nnormally ebullient client found exhausting, I wrote an article for the\nIndependent expressing my view that there should be an opportunity for a\nplaintiff to go before a judge at an early stage and ask that an apology be\nordered by the court. The judge could then call for immediate material from\nthe newspaper and form an impression of whether a correction was required\nand, if so, in what terms. While the plaintiff would be entitled to ask for\ncosts, the price for that fast-track procedure should be that he could be\nrequired to forgo his claim for damages as a term of obtaining an apology.\nI believe that I then envisaged that a judge would be able to form not only\na view of whether a claim was unarguable or certain to succeed, but also a\nrobust prima facie view on a case and seek a commonsense solution. But,\nnonetheless, I agree that the proposal put forward for a fast-track procedure\nis modest progress.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n74 HL Deb vol 570 c605 - 8.3.96\n75 June 1995\n76 c585\n41\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nDespite the anticipated reduced costs of the summary procedure there is no proposal to\nintroduce legal aid for such cases. In a written answer of 26 March 1996 Jonathan Evans,\nParliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department said that it was not the Government's\nintention to extend the scope of legal aid to libel cases.77 However the reduced costs could\nmean that plaintiffs of moderate means might be able to consider taking proceedings in\nrespect of a defamatory statement. \nSome commentators believe that the proposals would not necessarily reduce costs as summary\nhearings would still depend on resolving conflicts of evidence. In addition lawyers would still\nargue about the appropriateness of the procedure and the form of the correction and apology.\nIn addition it has been suggested that the proposals would tilt the present balance of power\nmore towards the media by lowering awards.\n2. The Bill\nClauses 8-11 of the Bill seek to provide for a new \"fast track\" procedure aimed at providing\na prompt and inexpensive remedy in less serious defamation cases. There would be no effect\non cases where there is a defence with realistic prospect of success to be argued nor cases\nwhere a serious charge has been made against a person's character. An entirely new regime\nwould be created under which every defamation action would come before a judge at an early\nstage for a decision on whether the claim is suitable for summary disposal. The judge's\npowers of summary disposal would enable him to dismiss weak claims, and in the case of\nstrong claims, to make an award in the plaintiff's favour including damages up to a fixed\nceiling (£10,000 is proposed in Clause 9 of the Bill) if he feels that the plaintiff would be\nadequately compensated. The Bill contains a special rule-making power in Clause 10 which\nindicates the procedure which is likely to be prescribed for the court's consideration of the\nsuitability of individual defamation claims for summary disposal. General rule-making\npowers are already contained in section 84 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 and section 75 of\nthe County Court Act 1984. Clause 10 indicates that the use of summary disposal would not\nbe dependant on an application by the parties. \nThe summary procedure is intended to benefit both plaintiffs and defendants and in the\nconsultation paper on the draft Bill the advantages for litigants were set out as follows:\n6.7 This early clarification of the issues, and testing the strength of both claim and\ndefences, should encourage more parties to settle before trial, and even before the\nspecial hearing. For those claims which cannot be settled, it offers a streamlined\ndisposal procedure where the claim is straightforward and less serious. Even if the\nissues are so complex, or the allegations so grave, that summary disposal cannot be\nappropriate, the cards will be on the table much sooner than is now the case.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n77 HC Deb vol 274 c541W - 26.3.96\n42\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nTaken together the summary, procedure and the proposed new offer of amends defence (see\nPart III B of this Paper) are intended to make relevant defamation actions more speedy and\nless costly.\nAt present virtually all defamation hearings are heard in the High Court as county court\njurisdiction is non-existent. In the consultation paper on the draft Bill the Lord Chancellor's\nDepartment said that the new procedure would filter out less complex cases and those, which,\neven if not trivial, are not weighty. Those cases could be suitable for disposal in the county\ncourt (where costs are lower) and once the new procedure had been set up the Lord\nChancellor would consider whether to exercise his power under section 1 of the Courts and\nLegal Services Act 1990 to confer jurisdiction on the county courts to hear such cases.\nClause 8 seeks to provide for the summary disposal of a claim without a jury. The court's\njurisdiction is defined in Clause 8(2) which seeks to provide for the court to dismiss the\nplaintiff's claim if it had no realistic prospect of success and there is no reason why it should\nnot be tried. Subsection 4 sets out the matters to which the court would be required to have\nregard in considering whether a claim should be tried. In Committee the Lord Chancellor\nmade it clear that the list is not intended to be exhaustive.78 The matters listed in subsection\n4 are:\n(a) whether all the defendants or potential defendants to the claim are before the court when\nthe question of summary disposal arises\n(b) whether there is another defendant against whom summary disposal would not be\nappropriate. (It could be that summary disposal against one defendant could prejudice\nthe fair trial of a claim against another defendant)\n(c) the extent to which there is a conflict of evidence\n(d) the seriousness of the alleged wrong (as regards the content of the statement and the\nextent of the publication) \n(e) whether a full trial of the claim would be justified in the circumstances\nThe proposed powers of the court to give relief are set out in Clause 9. A court would be\nable to do one or more of the following:\n(a) make a declaration that the statement was false and defamatory of the plaintiff\n(NB judges have not hitherto been able to decide the issue in defamation trials)\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n78 HL Deb vol 571 c245 - 2.4.96\n43\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\n(b) order that the defendant publish or cause to be published a suitable correction and\napology \n(c) award damages not exceeding £10,000 (the Lord Chancellor would be able to change\nthis prescribed amount by order subject to the negative resolution procedure79)\n(d) make an order restraining the defendant from publishing or further publishing the\ndefamatory statement\nBy clause 9(2) it would be for the parties to agree on the content of any correction or apology\nand on the time, manner, form and place of publication. However, if they could not agree\non the content then the court could direct the defendant to publish or cause to publish a\nsummary of the court's judgment or the parties' settlement. If the parties could not agree on\nany of the other matters then the court could direct the defendant to take such reasonable and\npracticable steps as the court considers appropriate. The court would not then be able to\ndictate the content of an apology or correction if the parties cannot agree.\nIn Committee, Lord Lester, supported by Lord Williams of Mostyn, sought to raise the ceiling\non the compensation that could be awarded under the summary procedure to £25,000.80 He\nbelieved that the operation of the procedure could become constrained as a result of the\n£10,000 maximum. In reply the Lord Chancellor referred to the difficulty of deciding on a\nfigure but said that he did not know why £25,000 was considered more appropriate than\n£10,000.81 He went on to say that he was concerned that the procedure should offer some\nattraction to a defendant as well as to a plaintiff and he took the view that the protection of\nthe £10,00 limit was important for the defendant. The amendment was withdrawn. \nClause 10 seeks to provide for rules of court to be made governing summary disposals.\nSubsection 2 lists specific matters for which rules might be made but without prejudice to\nthe general power to make rules. Provision could be made to:\n(a) authorise a party to apply for summary disposal at any stage of the proceedings\n(b) authorise the court to consider whether a claim is suitable for summary disposal and\nto dispose of it summarily where neither party has made an application for summary\ndisposal. That consideration could be triggered automatically by the taking of any\nstep in the proceedings by one or other of the parties or when the proceedings reach\na particular stage in the timetable laid down for the preparation of the case (see (c)\nbelow)\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n79 clause 9(3)\n80 HL Deb vol 571 c245ff - 2.4.96\n81 c247\n44\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\n(c) lay down a timetable for the preparation of a case \n(d) require the parties to identify the legal issues for determination in the proceedings\n(e) lay down the form in which evidence must be given.

The Notes on Clauses  for the Lords stages explain that this would be necessary\nas no time limit is given for the making of such an offer, except that it must be made\nbefore the serving of a defence. In the event that the court was considering whether a\ncase was suitable for summary determination, before a defence had been served, the\ncourt would need to know whether there was a possibility that the defendant would seek\nto rely on the offer of amends defence.\nThus it is envisaged that virtually every action will at some stage fall to be evaluated by the\nCourt as to its suitability for the summary procedure.\n3. Extent\nClause 11 seeks to provide that in their application to Northern Ireland the provisions of\nClauses 8 to 10 on summary disposals would apply only to the High Court. This is because,\nalthough most cases are brought in the High Court in Northern Ireland as in England and\nWales, there is currently a small county court jurisdiction in libel and slander with a statutory\nceiling of £3,000.\nIn Scotland summary procedures are already available for the disposal of defamation actions\nin both the Sheriff Court and the Court of Session.\nF. Evidence of Convictions\n1. The Bill\nClause 12 seeks to provide that in defamation proceedings evidence of a person's conviction\nwill no longer be conclusive proof that he committed the offence, unless he is the plaintiff.\nThis was a recommendation contained in the Neill working group report on Practice and\n45\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nProcedure in Defamation.82 However, as in all civil proceedings, evidence of a conviction\nwould still be admissible as evidence to prove that a person did commit the offence.\nThe consultation paper on the draft Bill explained the reasoning behind this clause (clause 10\nof the draft Bill) as follows:83\n7.1 Before 1968, a person's conviction of a criminal offence was not admissible in\ndefamation or any other civil actions. The curious result in one case was that a\nplaintiff who had been convicted of robbery succeeded in an action for libel against\na defendant who had published a statement that he was guilty of the robbery. After\n11 years, the defendant was unable to prove justification, on the balance of\nprobabilities, despite the previous conviction. The rules were changed following\nrecommendations of the Law Reform Committee so that :\n• in a defamation action, proof that a person has been convicted of an offence is,\nwhere relevant, conclusive evidence that he committed the offence (Civil\nEvidence Act 1968, s. 13); and\n• in other civil proceedings, the fact of a person's conviction is admissible, but not\nconclusive, evidence that he committed the offence, (ibid, s. 11).\n7.2 It is sometimes necessary to prove the guilt of a person who was not a party to\nthe civil proceedings, e.g. in a claim against an employer who is vicariously liable for\nthe acts of a convicted employee. However, the effect of making proof of a person's\nconviction conclusive in defamation proceedings to which he is not a party appears\nnot to have been fully considered. As the Neill working group pointed out, this rule\ncan operate unfairly when it prevents a party from challenging the correctness of some\nother person's conviction. It can inhibit a defendant, such as an investigative\njournalist, from justifying defamatory allegations about the conduct of police officers\nand others who were involved in the prosecution.\n7.3 Clause 10 narrows the application of the rule which makes conviction evidence\nconclusive, to those cases where the convicted person is the plaintiff, or one of several\nplaintiffs. Proof of the conviction of any other person will still be admissible\nevidence, under section 11, but it will no longer be conclusive.\nOn Second Reading the Lord Chancellor said that \"plaintiffs in defamation proceedings will\nno longer enjoy the artificial advantage of the rightness of someone else's conviction being\nunchallengeable\".84\nIn Committee Lord Lester expressed the view that the clause had \"welcome implications for\nfreedom of the press and public discussion of the conduct of those who exercise public\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n82 section XXI\n83 chapter 7, Reforming Defamation Law and Procedure\n84 HL Deb vol 570 c578 - 8.3.96\n46\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\npowers\".85 However Lord Williams of Mostyn expressed concern that the clause would admit\ncollateral attacks on criminal convictions and could cause unfairness to certain plaintiffs who\ncould not rely on a defendant's conviction as conclusive proof that he committed the offence\nin question.86\n2. Extent\nAmendments are made by Clause 12 to the relevant legislation in each of the three\njurisdictions of the United Kingdom87 so as to achieve the same result throughout the UK.\nG. Abolition of the Rule in Scott v Sampson - Damages and the\nPlaintiff's Reputation\n1. The Bill\nClause 13 seeks to abolish the common law rule known as the rule in Scott v Sampson88\nwhich restricts the evidence which a defendant can lead in mitigation of damages to show that\na plaintiff has a bad reputation. The defendant can always lead evidence to show the general\nbad reputation of the plaintiff but is not permitted to lead evidence of particular acts of\nmisconduct on the part of the plaintiff tending to show his character or disposition. Thus a\nplaintiff can recover damages based on an unblemished reputation even if it could have been\nshown that he had acted discreditably unless the defendant can show that the reputation he\nactually enjoyed at the date of publication was tarnished.\nLord Justice Neill's Working Group on Practice and Procedure in Defamation recommended\nthe abolition of the rule noting that one of the reasons why defendants in what appear on the\nsurface appear to be trivial cases are reluctant to settle is because they have information about\nthe conduct of the plaintiff which in their eyes makes his demand for damages appear to be\ndisproportionate89. Abolition of the rule in Scott v Sampson was previously recommended by\nboth the Porter and the Faulks Committees.90 \nClause 13 would then prevent the plaintiff from recovering damages for injury to his\nreputation beyond what he would be entitled to if everything likely to affect his reputation\n(at the time that damages fall to be assessed), in relation to the sector of his life to which the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n85 HL Deb vol 571 c248 - 2.4.96\n86 HL Deb vol 571 c248 - 2.4.96\n87 Civil Evidence Act 1968, Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland ) Act 1968 and the Civil Evidence\nAct (Northern Ireland) 1971\n88 (1882) 8 QBD 491\n89 section III, Report on Practice and Procedure in Defamation  July 1991\n90 Cmd 7536 (1948), paras 146-156 and Cmd 5909 (1975), para 372\n47\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\ndefamatory statement related, were public knowledge. It also seeks to enable the defendant\nto rely, in mitigation of damages, on evidence of relevant discreditable acts by the plaintiff\nas well as on evidence of the plaintiff's general reputation which can currently be introduced.\nIn this regard a defendant may introduce evidence that the plaintiff has been convicted of a\ncriminal offence whether or not that conviction is otherwise to be treated as spent for the\npurposes of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. Paragraph 1 of the Schedule 2 to the\nBill seeks to make a consequential amendment to section 8 of the 1974 Act.\nIt would be for the court to decide whether the matters raised do relate to the relevant sector\nof the plaintiff's life and subsection 3 seeks to give the court power also to exclude evidence\nof specific facts if it appears in the interests of justice to do so, having regard to the time\nwhich has elapsed since the matters in question occurred and their relative unimportance in\nthe quantification of damages. \nBy subsection 4 this clause would not apply to causes of action arising before the clause\ncomes into force.\nOn Lords Second Reading Lord Williams expressed concern that the purpose of the Bill to\nmake defamation proceedings simpler and less costly could be undermined if there were\nlengthy and complicated hearings about matters not going to the question in issue such as\ncharacter evidence.91\nClause 13 has been described by Patrick Milmo QC92 as arguably the most controversial\nprovision in the Bill. It is feared that this provision could become a 'muckraker's charter'.\nNewspapers who are defendants in defamation cases could be tempted or advised to undertake\nan in-depth investigation into the plaintiff's private life seeking to unearth something to his\ndiscredit which they could then expose in open court. However it would protect against the\nsituation which, for example, arose in libel cases involving the late Robert Maxwell where\ndiscreditable actions by a plaintiff, not related to current proceedings, could not be brought\nbefore the court.\n2. Extent\nClause 13 would extend to England and Wales and Northern Ireland.\nH. Statutory Privilege\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n91 HL Deb vol 570 c581 - 8.3.96\n92 Fast track or gridlock? - New Law Journal 16.2.96\n48\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\n1. Absolute Privilege\ni. The Bill\nClause 15 seeks to confirm and clarify the existing statutory privilege of contemporaneous\nreports of judicial proceedings which is currently contained in section 3 of the Law of Libel\nAmendment Act 1888. Section 3 was silent as to the nature of the privilege but Clause 15\nmakes it clear that it would be absolute and so it will not therefore be displaced even if a\nreport was published maliciously. By subsection 2 the report will be treated as having been\nmade contemporaneously and thus attract the privilege where there is a restriction (either in\nlaw or by court order) on publication provided that it is published as soon as practicable after\npublication is permitted.\nSubsection 3 seeks to apply the privilege to:\n(a) any court in the United Kingdom (including any tribunal or body exercising the judicial\npower of the State)\n(b) the European Court of Justice or any court attached to that court\n(c) the European Court of Human Rights\n(d) any international criminal tribunal established by the Secretary of State if the United\nNations or by an international agreement to which the United Kingdom is a party (eg\nan international war crimes tribunal).\nii Extent\nThis clause would apply throughout the United Kingdom.\n2. Qualified Privilege\ni. The Bill\nSections 7 and 9 of the Defamation Act 1952 together with the Schedule to that Act specify\ncategories of reports published in newspapers or broadcast which are given qualified privilege\nas a defence to an action for libel. Broadly these relate to reports of specified legislative and\njudicial proceedings and proceedings at public meetings. Qualified privilege applies as a\ndefence in circumstances in which an untrue and defamatory statement has been published\nbut there was no improper motive in publishing.\n49\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nClause 16 and Schedule 1 seek to bring this area of law up to date and in particular include\nreports relating to proceedings in European institutions. The Schedule contains a provision\nseeking to enable the Lord Chancellor (for England and Wales and Northern Ireland) and the\nSecretary of State (for Scotland) to designate (by order subject to the negative resolution\nprocedure) other bodies in respect of which the privilege would apply. This would allow for\nnewly created statutory or other bodies to be included within the scope of this defence. The\nconsultation on the draft Bill explained the effect of these provisions and the reasoning behind\nthe changes as follows (Clause 16 relates to clause 13 in the draft Bill):93\n9.1 By sections 7 and 9 of the Defamation Act 1952, specified categories of reports,\npublished in newspapers, or broadcast, were given qualified privilege as a defence to\nan action for libel. Broadly these relate to reports of specified legislative and judicial\nproceedings, and proceedings at public meetings. A qualified privilege provides a\ndefence, even where the defendant has published a statement which was defamatory\nand untrue, provided that he did not have an improper motive (such as ill-will or\nspite) for publishing it. In some cases, copies of official documents, or extracts,\nrather than reports of them attract the privilege.\n9.2 The specified categories are set out in the Schedule to the Act, in a list which is\ndivided into two parts. The first part broadly covers reports of legislative and judicial\nproceedings and proceedings of public inquiries and international organisations.\nThose listed in the second part relate to a range of public meetings and proceedings\nof associations. Reports in the second part are \"subject to explanation or\ncontradiction\", which means that the defence is not available if it is proved that,\nalthough the defendant has been asked to publish a reasonable letter or statement by\nway of explanation or contradiction, he has not done so.\n9.3 Clause 13 brings the privilege up to date in two ways. Firstly, it extends the\nprivilege to all forms of publication. The 1952 privilege excluded many media -\nincluding free newspapers which might now reasonably be expected to carry such\nreports as part of the service they provide. It also excluded one-off or occasional\npublications, and periodicals which appeared less often than monthly. Since the\nprivilege has always applied to historical reports, as well as to contemporaneous ones,\nit is difficult to see any justification for restricting it to publications which appear\nfrequently, and broadcasts.\n9.4 Secondly, it greatly extends the categories of reports and copies to which this\nprivilege applies, by substituting a new Schedule. The universal requirement is that\nthe report or copy should be fair and accurate. As recommended by the Neill\nworking group, the new Schedule recognises that it is no longer appropriate to confine\nthe privilege to reports of parliamentary and other proceedings in this country, and\ntherefore extends the privilege to cover reports of legislative, court and other public\nproceedings, and official publications on a world wide basis. These reports will have\nthe same privilege as reports of UK proceedings already have under the 1952 Act.\nThe categories of report which are privileged, subject to explanation or contradiction,\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n93 Chapter 9, Reforming Defamation Law and Procedure July 1995\n50\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nare also enlarged and modernised. This is broadly in line with the recommendations\nof the Faulks Committee, as indorsed by the Neill Report, with a capacity for further\nmodernisation as it becomes necessary. This likely need is illustrated by the fact that\nthe Faulks Committee recommended, in 1975, that the privilege should apply to\nreports of the adjudications, statements etc issued by several bodies, such as the Press\nCouncil, which have now ceased to exist but been superseded by new bodies.\nii Extent\nClause 16 and Schedule 1 would apply throughout the United Kingdom.\nJ. Financial Effects and Business Compliance Costs of the Bill\nThe Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill states that:\nThe effect of the Bill will be to simplify and streamline the procedure in\ndefamation cases and to encourage earlier settlement, so reducing the cost\nand the number of cases decided by the court. There may be some\nincrease in the number of claims made, because some people who have\nbeen defamed are now deterred from proceeding by fears that the costs will\nbe excessive.\nand:\nThere are no significant business compliance costs. Clause 1 will reduce\nthe risk of printers, distributors and others being held liable when they\nhave unknowingly contributed to the publication of defamatory material.\nThere should be a corresponding reduction in the cost of insuring against\nthe risk of liability for libel.\nThere has, however, been some controversy over whether the result of the Bill's reforms, in\nparticular, the offer of amends defence and the summary procedure, will in fact be to reduce\nthe number of cases going to court and over the effect of the innocent dissemination defence\non distributors. These issues were discussed in Parts III B, III E and III A respectively of this\nPaper.\nK. Commencement\nClause 20 sets out the commencement provisions. The clauses relating to innocent\ndissemination, the limitation period, evidence of convictions, abolition of the rule in Scott v\n51\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nSimpson, evidence concerning proceedings in Parliament would come into force two months\nafter enactment. The remaining provisions would come into force by order.\n52\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nIV Other Issues not in the Current Bill\nA. Gagging Writs\nOn Second Reading Lord Simon of Glaisdale, a former Law Lord, raised the subject of\n\"gagging\" writs. He said that \"they are generally felt, and especially recently, to shut out\ninformation which if it had been published would have precluded a great deal of loss and\nscandal.\"94\nIn Committee Lord Lester sought to introduce an amendment on behalf of himself and Lord\nSimon which would have provided for relief (including damages) to be given by the court in\nthe event that a writ was threatened or issued without reasonable cause alleging defamation.\nLord Lester said:95\nThe amendment follows from a point raised by the\nnoble and learned Lord during the Second Reading debate;\nnamely, the notorious practice by some rich and powerful\nindividuals in the commercial world and elsewhere to\nissue groundless or so-called gagging writs to suppress\ndamaging information about themselves or their\nmalpractices from the public. One of the most notorious\nexamples was the practice of the late Robert Maxwell. He\nwas able to take advantage of the fact that under the law\nof libel, as under no other branch of the law of tort, the\nburden is on the defendant to discharge the effective\nburden of disproving that the words published or to be\npublished are false. That problem would be solved if the\nburden of proof were shifted. That is the subject of one\nof my later amendments. On the assumption that the\nburden remains upon the defendant, I submit that it is fair\nand reasonable to provide the defendant with an effective\nremedy for the unwarranted and groundless use of gagging\nlibel writs.\nBoth Lord Williams of Mostyn and the Lord Chancellor recognised the possibility of a\nmischief but both took the view that it was a mischief that could be resisted. The amendment\nwas withdrawn. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n94 HL Deb vol 570 c604 - 8.3.96\n95 HL Deb vol 571 c236-7 - 2.4.96\n53\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nLord Lester and Lord Simon returned to the mater on report and the Lord Chancellor\nundertook that his Department would consider the matter further.96\nB. Public Figure Defence\nDuring the Second Reading debate Lord Williams of Mostyn asked whether the Government\nhad a concluded view about the public figure defence (known as the \"Sullivan\" defence after\nan American case97).98 Such a defence means that if a person is in public life and is properly\ndescribed as a public figure, he or she cannot succeed in defamation unless malice can be\nproved and demonstrated against the defendant. Lord Alexander of Weedon, a former\nchairman of the Bar Council, said that he had grave doubts about the desirability of moving\ntoward a Sullivan defence. He said that the press have ample ability to draw to the public's\nattention facts which they consider affect the conduct of a person in public office and that\nsome of the facts they draw to the public's interest are only doubtfully in the public interest. \nThe question of a Sullivan defence was considered by the Neill working group99 and it was\nnot in favour of its introduction in the UK. They took the view that \"standards of care and\naccuracy in the press are ... not such as to give any confidence that a \"Sullivan\" defence\nwould be treated responsibly\" and that it would mean, in effect, that newspapers could publish\nmore or less what they liked, provided they were honest, if their subject happened to be\nwithin the definition of \"public figure\". They concluded that the media were adequately\nprotected by the defences of justification and fair comment. \nThe working group's conclusion was endorsed by Lord Inglewood on winding up the Second\nReading debate and he made particular reference to the different culture in the United\nStates.100\nC. Reversing the Burden of Proof\nAt Committee stage Lord Lester sought to introduce an amendment to reverse the burden of\nproof in defamation cases. At present damage is presumed which means that the defendant\nmust prove his case whereas generally in civil proceedings it is the plaintiff who must prove\nhis case. Lord Lester said that the existence of the rule had important consequences for the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n96 HL Deb vol 571 c643 - 16.4.96\n97 New York Times v Sullivan (1964) 376 US 254\n98 HL Deb vol 570 c579 - 8.3.96\n99 section XIX Report on Practice and Procedure in Defamation July 1991\n100 HL Deb vol 570 c607-8 - 8.3.96\n54\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\ndefence of libel actions and said that \"villains\" can (and frequently do) recover substantial\ndamages without having to show that what has been published about them is false. He said\nthat only two arguments had ever been given for the present incidence of the burden of proof:\nthe deterrent argument as expressed by the Faulks Committee that the rule tends to inculcate\na spirit of caution in publishers of potentially actionable statements and the argument that\nthe plaintiff cannot be expected to prove a negative. \nLord Williams of Mostyn did not support the amendment on the basis that the scales are often\nuneven in defamation cases where the plaintiff is often a private person who cannot get legal\naid and the defendant is often a wealthy corporation. \nThe Lord Chancellor was not in favour of the amendment either. He commented that the\nNeill working group had pointed out that it is normally the plaintiff who is the accused and\nwho should be presumed innocent of the defamatory charge unless the defendant can prove\nthat he was guilty. \nLord Lester withdrew the amendment. \nD. Death of a Party to Defamation Proceedings\nThe publication of defamatory words about someone who is already dead cannot be the\nsubject of a legal proceedings under the present law. The Faulks Committee recommended\na right of action, available to certain close relatives for five years after the person's death,\nlimited to a claim for a declaration that the subject matter complained of was untrue, an\ninjunction against repetition and costs.101 In addition the Committee recommended that a\ncause of action in respect of defamation should survive against the estate of the deceased and\nthat where the person defamed has started an action but has died at any item prior to\njudgement his personal representative should be entitled to carry on the action to the extent\nof recovering both general and special damages.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n101 para 423,Cmnd 5909 1975\n55\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nOn 25 October 1990 the Lord Chancellor issued a consultation paper on the rules under which\nan action for defamation cannot survive the death of either party to it. The consultation paper\nconsidered the arguments for and against the rule and put forward a number of options.\nHowever in a written answer of 14 May 1991102 the Lord Chancellor announced that the\nresponses to the consultation paper had disclosed \"widely diverging\" views as to whether or\nnot it would be fairer to allow proceedings to be started or continued in the absence of a party\nwho has died. He said that the response had not persuaded him that the present rule should\nbe changed. This response was endorsed by the Neill working group in its Report on\nPractice and Procedure in Defamation.103\nThe issue of death of a party in defamation proceedings was not raised during the Lords\ndebates on the current Bill.\nV Scotland\nAlthough the law of defamation is substantially the same in Scotland as in England and\nWales, there are certain procedural differences in Scotland which mean that some of the\nproblems that are perceived in the English system do not arise. For example, a pursuer in\nScotland must state at the outset the sum of damages which he claims and although he may\namend this sum as the action proceeds the court cannot award him more than the final\nspecified figure in making its judgment. This means that the very high and unpredictable\nawards that have been made in English cases are unlikely to arise in Scotland but in any\nevent the majority of cases are heard in the Sheriff Courts (where the Sheriff sets the amount\nof the award) rather than in the Court of Session by way of jury trial.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n102 HC Deb vol 528 c465-66WA - 14.5.91\n103 July 1991\n56\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/60\nAppendix\nLords Debates:\nSecond Reading HL Deb vol 570 c576ff, 8 March 1996\nCommittee Stage HL Deb vol 571 c211ff, 2 April 1996\nReport Stage HL Deb vol 571 c628ff, 16 April 1996\nThird Reading HL Deb vol 572 c17ff, 7 May 1996\n57\n\n\nPl\nea\nse\n c\nut\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nR\ne\nse\na\nr\nc\nh \nP\na\npe\nr \n96\n/6\n0\nSe\nct\nio\nn\n C\no\nde\n: \nH\nA\nS\nT\nitl\ne:\n \nD\ne\nfa\nm\na\ntio\nn\n \nB\nill\n [H\nL\n], \nB\nill\n 1\n27\n o\nf \n19\n95\n-9\n6:\n \nL\na\nw\n \na\nn\nd \nPr\no\nc\ne\ndu\nre\nIt \nw\no\nu\nld\n g\nre\nat\nly\n h\nel\np \nto\n e\nn\nsu\nre\n t\nha\nt \nRe\nse\nar\nch\n P\nap\ner\ns \nfu\nlfi\nl \nth\nei\nr \npu\nrp\nos\ne \nif \nM\nem\nbe\nrs\n (o\nr t\nhe\nir \nsta\nff)\n w\nou\nld \nfil\nl \nin\n a\nnd\n r\net\nur\nn \nth\nis \nbr\nie\nf\npr\ne-\nad\ndr\nes\nse\nd \nqu\nes\ntio\nnn\nai\nre\n. \nN\neg\nat\niv\ne \nre\nsp\non\nse\ns \nca\nn \nbe\n a\ns \nus\nef\nul\n a\ns \npo\nsit\niv\ne.\nFo\nr \nyo\nur\n p\nur\npo\nse\ns, \ndi\nd \nyo\nu \nfin\nd \nth\nis \npa\npe\nr:\nV\ner\ny \nu\nse\nfu\nl\nQu\nite\n \nu\nse\nfu\nl\nN\not\n m\nuc\nh \nus\ne\n1.1.\n \n \n \nTo\no \nlo\nng\nTh\ne \nri\ngh\nt l\nen\ngt\nh\nTo\no \nsh\nor\nt\n2.2.\n \n \n \nC\nlea\nr\nN\not\n a\nlw\nay\ns \ncl\nea\nr\nR\nat\nhe\nr \nu\nn\ncl\nea\nr\n3.3.\n \n \n \nA\nn\ny \nc\no\nm\nm\ne\nn\nts\n? \nN\na\nm\ne\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n \nM\nP\n/A\nss\nis\nta\nn\nt \nto\n \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n(P\nle\nas\ne \npr\nin\nt)\n\n\nPlease fold\nINTERNAL\nMiss Nicola Harland\nHouse of Commons\nDepartment of the Library\n1 Derby Gate\nLondon SW1A 2DG\nPlease fold\n\n\nRecent Research Papers on related subjects include:\n96/61 Defamation Bill [HL], Bill 127 of 1995-96: 16.05.96\nParliamentary Privilege\n96/42 Family Law Bill [HL] [Bill 82 of 1995/96] 21.03.96\nDivorce Law Reform\n96/39 Family Law Bill [HL] [Bill 82 of 1995/96] 21.03.96\nDomestic Violence\n \n\n\nCivil Justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

          "  \nEmployment and Training\nSchemes for the Unemployed\nResearch Paper 96/66\n21 May 1996\nFor many years, Government-funded training, employment and job search schemes have\nformed part of the attack on the problem of long-term unemployment. This Research Paper,\nin Part I, summarises the programmes which are currently available or have been announced\nfor future years. Part II gives very brief details of earlier schemes, tried since the war. It is\nnot always easy to know what to include in a list of this type. Some educational, enterprise,\nor regional aid schemes could be said to be directed towards reducing unemployment.\nSimilarly, elements of the social security system and the whole infrastructure of Job Centres\nand Training and Enterprise Councils have a role to play. The aim, however, has been to\ncover the more obvious, mainstream programmes which have generally come under the\nauspices of the Department of Employment (now the Department for Education and\nEmployment).\nThis Research Paper updates Research Note 90/25 (\"Training, Enterprise and Employment\nSchemes\") and Research Papers 93/40, 94/114 and 95/51 (\"Employment and Training\nSchemes for the Unemployed\") .\nJulia Lourie\nBusiness and Transport Section\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n CONTENTS\nPage\nI CURRENT SCHEMES\nA.

Fuller details are contained\nin the works listed in Part III of this Paper. Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) have\na good deal of discretion in how they operate schemes so that TEC administered programmes\nwill vary from area to area and may not even go under the same names as those given in this\nPaper. The names and addresses of local TECs and LECs are given in the TEC Directory\n[see Part III, 5, below].\nA. Training for Work  (TfW)\nThis is the main training programme for the adult unemployed. It replaced Employment\nTraining and Employment Action in 1993 while retaining the main features of both.\nAnnounced: 12 November 1992, at the time of the Autumn Statement. Gillian Shephard,\nthen Secretary of State for Employment gave details in a Written Answer:1\nTraining for Work, a new adult training and\nwork programme, to be run by training and enterprise\ncouncils (TECS) in England and Wales and Local\nEnterprise Companies (LECS) in Scotland, will\nreplace employment training and employment action.\nTECs and LECs will have important new flexibilities\nto develop programmes of skills training, temporary\nwork and job preparation to meet the needs of local\nunemployed people and local circumstances. TECs\nand LECs will be encouraged to use these flexibilities\nto make best use of their resources, for example by\ndeveloping training credit schemes and expanding\nuseful temporary work in our public services. I expect\nthe new programme to provide 320,000 opportunities\nin 1993-94.\nIn order to help improve performance, the\nfunding regime will be developed to offer a\nprogressively higher proportion of payment for\nresults, including payments for participants gaining\njobs or qualifications. This will strengthen the\nincentives for TECs to deliver programmes that best\nhelp individuals and meet labour market needs.\nToday's announcement incorporates most of\nthe recommendations made by the TEC Adult\nTraining Working Group, including the merger of\nEmployment Training and Employment Action and\nthe development of a new payment system based on\nstarts and outputs.\nStarted: April 1993\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 HC Deb 12 November 1992, c 903W\n1\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nEligibility: TfW is aimed primarily at people aged 18-63 inclusive who have been\nunemployed and receiving benefit for 26 weeks or more. Certain groups (people with\ndisabilities, people with literacy and numeracy needs, those who need English language\ntraining, lone parents, returners to the labour market and victims of large-scale redundancies)\ncan gain immediate entry. Ex regulars can count time in service towards the 26 week\nqualifying period and ex-offenders can count time in custody. Priority is given to people\nendorsed as disabled or in need of Foundation Level Training and to people aged 18 to 24\nwho have been unemployed for two years or more. The \"second priority\" group covers\npeople who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who are referred from Jobplan\nworkshops, 1-2-1, or Workwise and people who have been unemployed for 24 months or\nmore who are referred from Restart courses.\nAllowances: Participants receive an allowance equal to their previous benefit entitlement plus\nan additional £10 a week. In some cases, help with travel costs or the child care costs of lone\nparents is provided. Some participants (about 12%) have employed status and receive a wage\nfrom their employer.\nAdministration: TfW is run by Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England and\nWales and Local Enterprise Councils (LECs) in Scotland. The training is provided by local\n\"providers\" who may be employers, voluntary organisations, further education colleges or\nspecialist training organisations. The providers operate under contracts with TECs, who are,\nin turn, under contract to the regional offices of the Department for Education and\nEmployment. Participants receive guidance and assessment before entering the programme\nand draw up individual participation plans. These might specify training courses aimed at\nNational Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), short work preparation courses or job specific\ntraining with a local employer. They could also include a period of temporary work.\nDuration: The average length of stay on TfW courses is 20 weeks.\nFunding: Since April 1995, TECs have been funded wholly on the basis of starts (25%) and\noutcomes (75%) for TfW.2 Outcomes are jobs and qualifications.\nCosts and Numbers: Statistics which give an indication of the scale, cost and success of\nTFW and its predecessors can be found in the relevant Departmental Reports [see Part III 1-2\nbelow]:\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n2 HC Deb 10 May 1995, c 461W\n2\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nTraining for Work and Predecessors (England)\n1992/93*\nOutturn\n1993/94\n Outturn\n1994/95\nOutturn\n1995/96\nEstimated\noutturn\n1996/97\nplans\n1997/98\nplans\n1998/99\nplans\nExpenditure\n(£ million)\n753 760 693 540 485 483 483\nNumber of\nStarts\n(000s)\n291 292 276 214 197 212 206\nPercentage of\nleaves gaining\np o s i t i v e\noutcomes***\n41** 42\nPercentage of\nleavers gaining\njobs\n38 42 45 49 49\nPercentage of\nleavers gaining\nNVQs\n42 36 30 30 30\n* Employment Training and Employment Action.

It replaced the Youth\nTraining Scheme in 1990. \nAnnounced: 21 November 1989, by Norman Fowler, then Secretary of State for\nEmployment, in a speech to the CBI Conference in Harrogate:3\nYOUTH TRAINING - QUALIFYING FOR SUCCESS\nThe key features of Youth Training, to take Britain's\nyoungsters into tomorrow's high-skill jobs are:\n- RAISING the minimum attainment level for all young\npeople on the programme\n- EMPHASISING higher level skills\n- IMPROVING job-finding for young people covered by\nthe Government's guarantee\n- AUGMENTING local arrangements for vocational\ntraining and education for young people\n- INCREASING flexibility and cost effectiveness in the\ndesign of training programmes, and in funding\narrangements.\nTHE AIMS IN DETAIL\n- all young people will be offered training programmes\nleading to qualifications equivalent to, at least, level 2 in\nthe framework established by the National Council for\nVocational Qualifications\n- a key role for TECs in delivering the programme, who\nwill be asked to meet demanding targets for progressive\nincreases in skills attainment, particularly at craft and\ntechnician levels\n- a broad aim of doubling the numbers of young people\nsecuring qualifications at level 2, and at level 3 and\nabove, over the next 2-3 years\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 Dept. of Employment Press Notice, 21 November 1989: \"Norman Fowler Announces Major Reforms of Youth\nTraining\"\n4\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\n- a significant proportion of TECs' funding to be related\ndirectly to their achievement of qualifications and jobs for\nyoung people\n- the Government's Guarantee will be maintained as now,\nwith the enhancement that all young people who are still\nnon-employed towards the end of their training must be\noffered job tasting and job finding facilities\n- particular attention to be given to young people with\nspecial training needs, eg. individual action plans for\nthose for whom training for level 2 qualifications is not\nimmediately a reasonable prospect\n- a continuing strong emphasis on health and safety and\nequal opportunities\n- length of training, and its funding by TECS, to be linked\nto the standards to be achieved and the needs of the\nyoung people, not determined by a rigid uniform set of\ncentrally-prescribed rules as under YTS\n- TECs will be able to fund improvements in other\narrangements which support training and vocational\neducation, including business-education partnerships,\nindividual learning plans for young people, and\nimprovements in local information and guidance services.\nStarted: Nationally, on 29 May 1990. In areas where TECs were already operating, YT\ncame in at varying dates in April and May 1990.\nEligibility: Generally, YT is designed for young people aged over the minimum school\nleaving age but under 18 who are not in full time education or a job. No-one may remain\non YT past their 25th birthday. Unemployed 16 and 17 year olds are guaranteed a place, as\nare those who have reached the age of 18 but have been unable to enter YT for the first time\nbecause of disability, ill health, pregnancy, custodial sentence, remand in custody, language\ndifficulties or as a result of a care order. When the Government withdrew the right to income\nsupport from unemployed 16 and 17 year olds in September 1988, it complemented this \"by\nthe guarantee of a place on the Youth Training Scheme to every person under 18 who is not\nin full time education and who does not go into a job\".4 The disabled, single parents and a\nfew other special groups aged under 18 still qualify for income support.\nAllowances: Trainees qualify for an allowance of £29.50 a week if they are 16 and £35 a\nweek if they are 17 or more. These figures have not been increased since July 1988 and\nApril 1986 respectively. TECs and providers can top up these allowances if they wish and\nhelp with travel, lodging or child care costs, but any such payments are entirely discretionary.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n4 DHSS Press Notice on the Social Security Bill 1987/8, 23 October 1987\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nSome YT participants (about 30%) have employed status and are paid a wage by their\nemployer.\nAdministration: YT is run by TECs under contractual arrangements similar to those\napplying to TfW. TECs enter into contracts with the Regional Government Offices of the\nDepartment for Education and Employment. Funding is currently based on the time an\nindividual spends in training (\"training weeks\") and partly on the \"outcomes\" (i.e.\nqualifications) achieved. Between 25% and 40% of the budget is available for outcomes.\nThe government hopes to increase this percentage although it is aware of concern that too\nmuch emphasis on outcomes could prove detrimental to the chances of less able young people\nwho are less likely to gain qualifications.5 TECs enter into contracts with local providers\n(employers, colleges etc.) who provide the actual training. Trainees draw up individual\ntraining plans. The aim is that they should work towards an approved qualification at or\nabove NVQ level 2. From April 1995 all funding of Youth Training has been by means of\nYouth Credits. [See Section C, below.] \nThe Future: Youth Training is due to be absorbed within the Modern Apprenticeship Scheme\nover the next few years [see Section D below]. Sir Ron Dearing recommended that YT\nshould be relaunched as a system of National Traineeships, available at Foundation,\nIntermediate and perhaps Advanced levels, providing progression to Modern Apprenticeships\nand the work-based route.6 Gillian Shephard, Secretary of State for Education and\nEmployment has welcomed the proposal and is consulting on the detail of the new\narrangements with a view to phased implementation from September 1997.7\nCosts and Numbers: Statistics which give an indication of the scale, cost and success of YT\ncan be found in the relevant Departmental Reports [See Part III, 1-2, below]:\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 Employment Department Consultation Document, \"Proposed Youth Training and Modern Apprenticeships\nFunding Arrangements from 1996/97\", 1995\n6 Review of Qualifications for 16-19 Year Olds, March 1996\n7 HC Deb 27 March 1996, c 1032\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nYouth Training and Modern Apprenticeships (England)\n1992/93\nOutturn\n1993/94\nOutturn\n1994/95\nOutturn\n1995/96\nEst.\noutturn\n1996/97\nPlans\n1997/98\nPlans\n1998/99\nPlans\nExpenditure\n(£ million)*\n617 640 647 668 765 809 804\nFirst time\nentrants (000s)\n175 162 179 206 166 167 204\nPercentage of\nleavers gaining a\nqualification\n50 67 62 65 70 73 75\n* Funding for Modern Apprenticeships began in 1995/96.\nIncludes £28 million in 1994/95 for careers guidance\nIncludes provision for Bridging Allowance from £3 million in 1994-95 to £4.75\nmillion in 1996-97\nFurther Reading\n1.

Youth Credits (YC)\nThis is really a mechanism for funding Youth Training, Modern Apprenticeships and other\nforms of training for young people which is designed to give the young people themselves\nmore control over the type of training they receive.\nAnnounced: 27 March 1990, by Michael Howard, then Secretary of State for Employment:8\nThe initiative that I am announcing today marks\nan important new departure in our policies for training\nyoung people. Its aim is to excite young people about the\nbenefits of continuing in training and further education\nafter they have left school and to raise the amount and\nquality of training provided by employers. The initiative\nhas the potential to revolutionise attitudes to training in\nthis country.\n.....................................................\nWe must also motivate young people themselves\nto understand the importance to them of quality training\nand to come to expect training as a normal part of\nemployment. There has been widespread interest in\ntraining credits as a means of achieving this. The\nConfederation of British Industry in particular has\nadvocated credits in its report \"Towards a Skills\nRevolution\" and has proposed pilot schemes at local level\nto test them out.\nTraining credits represent an entitlement to train\nto approved standards. They would be issued to young\npeople who would be able to present their credit either to\nan employer who makes training available or to a\nspecialist provider of training if the young person is\nunable to find employment. Young people would be given\nquality careers advice and guidance to help them to put\ntheir credit to best use. A monetary value would be shown\non the face of the credit, and it would be open to\nemployers and the body issuing the credit to supplement\nthis as necessary to secure higher-cost training or other\npriorities.\n.....................................................\nOverall funding for these pilot schemes will come\nin large part from planned provision for youth training.\nThere will also be a contribution from the relevant element\nof local education authority provision for 16 to 18-year-\nolds undertaking part-time training and education. From\ntheir existing expenditure plans, the Government are\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 HC Deb 27 March 1990, cc 209, 210-1\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nmaking available a further £12 million in 1991-92, rising\nto £25 million in the following year. This will bring the\ntotal estimated resources available to the training and\nenterprise councils running pilot credit schemes to £115\nmillion by 1992-93.\nStarted: On a pilot basis in 10 TEC areas in England and Wales and one LEC area in\nScotland in April 1991. A further 9 TECs and LECs started pilot schemes in April 1993 with\nanother 14 joining in April 1994. The intention was that:\n\"in 1996, within the lifetime of the next Parliament, every 16 and 17 year old\nleaving full-time education will have the offer of a training credit.\"9\nHowever, this deadline was beaten and by April 1995 every TEC in England had introduced\nYouth Credits for access to YT and Modern Apprenticeships.10\nAdministration: This varies from TEC to TEC. In some cases, young people are issued\nwith a voucher, cheque book or plastic card which entitles them to training up to a certain\nvalue, say £1,000. Employed young people can use the credit to buy training provided by the\nemployer. Unemployed young people can use it to pay for their guaranteed Youth Training\nplace. Where young people attend courses which would normally be free (eg at further\neducation colleges), the college receives the training credit instead of the normal subsidy from\nthe Further Education Funding Council.\nCosts and Numbers: See Youth Training Section [ Section B above].\nFurther Reading\n1.

Modern Apprenticeships (MApps)\nThis is really an upgrading of Youth Training, designed to qualify young people to NVQ level\n3, rather than NVQ level 2, by means of work-based training. From April 1996, Accelerated\nModern Apprenticeships (aMAs) have been merged with Modern Apprenticeships.\nAnnounced: 30 November 1993. In a statement released at the time of the Budget, David\nHunt, then Secretary of State for Employment, said:11\n\"We must tap the potential of our young people to reach higher levels of\nachievement and skills if we are to beat our competitors and stay ahead. That\nis why I plan a new approach to apprenticeship, offering young people work-\nbased training leading to technician, supervisor and similar level qualifications\n- in other words, modern apprenticeships. We and the Training and Enterprise\nCouncils will be working closely with employers and sector training bodies to\nprepare for a major increase in the number of apprenticeships available. We\nare aiming to increase to over 40,000 the number of young people reaching\nNVQ Level 3 through training in England - roughly tripling the current\nnumber.\nYoung people will also be offered more and better careers guidance to help\nthem choose the best options for gaining qualifications.\nWe will be running the apprenticeships using the new and successful\narrangements for Youth Credits. Credits will be available nationally to all 16\nand 17 year old school leavers from 1995/6, a year earlier than we had\noriginally planned.\"\nStarted: Prototypes started running in 40 TEC areas in the following sectors from September\n1994: agriculture, business administration, chemicals, child care, electrical installation,\nengineering manufacturing, engineering construction, information technology, marine\nengineering, Merchant Navy, polymers, retail, steel and travel service.12 The scheme has\nbeen available nationwide since September 1995, and Modern Apprenticeship Training\nFrameworks have been approved in at least 54 sectors.13\nDetails: To implement modern apprenticeships, the Industry Training Organisation for\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n11 Dept. of Employment Press Release, 30 Nov. 1993: \"David Hunt announces new modern apprenticeship\nscheme to boost Britain's Skills\"\n12 Dept of Employment Press Release, 27 April 1994:  \"Modern Apprenticeships - It's full speed ahead!\" says\nDavid Hunt\".

The aim is to develop a framework incorporating all the skills, knowledge and\nunderstanding required to achieve the qualifications for a modern apprenticeship. These\ninclude level 3 NVQs and core skills. The apprenticeships are based on ability and are not\ntime-served. These frameworks are approved by a joint modern apprenticeship group\ncomprising representatives from the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE), the\nNational Council of Industrial Training Organisations and the Training and Enterprise\nNational Council.

The credits have a monetary value and are redeemed by the employer or training\nprovider. The scheme requires the employer, the apprentice and the TEC to sign a training\nagreement, which sets out the responsibilities and commitments of each party.\nEligibility: Modern Apprenticeships are targeted at 16 and 17 year old school leavers.\nAccelerated Modern Apprenticeships were aimed at 18 and 19 year old school leavers.\nAllowances: As for YT, the minimum training allowance is £29.50 a week at 16 years of\nage and £35 at 17 or over. However, most employers pay their apprentices considerably more\nthan this. An early survey of the prototypes found the average weekly salary was £76, the\nhighest £165 and the lowest £29.50.15\nCosts and Numbers: There were over 15,000 young people training under MApps in\nFebruary 1996 and we were \"on course for well over 20,000 by the end of March.\"16\nGovernment figures do not separate expenditure on modern apprenticeships from that on\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n15 Employment Gazette, June 1995, \"Modern Apprenticeships: the experience so far\"\n16 DfEE Press Notice, 20 February 1996, \"More than 20,000 Modern Apprenticeships by the end of March\npredicts James Paice\"\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nYouth Training in general.

In a Press Notice accompanying the Budget, Gillian\nShephard, Secretary of State for Education and Employment, said:\n     \"We will also, in certain areas, be requiring people who have been\nunemployed for more than two years to take up a work experience place.\nPotentially these pilot programmes offer a change of very major significance.\nFor those who have lost heart or motivation, it may be just the impetus they\nneed. For those who are not serious about trying to find work this is just the\nimpetus the taxpayer would expect us to administer. We intend to monitor the\nresults very carefully indeed.\"18\nStarted: On a pilot basis in Hull and Medway and Maidstone, in April 1996. \nEligibility: People aged 18-50 who have been unemployed for two years or more.\nDetails:  In the first 13 weeks a range of opportunities and programmes will be offered\nto claimants including: general help with jobsearch; a voluntary 1-2-1 programme; Jobclub;\nTraining for Work; the opportunity of a Worktrial or Workstart vacancy; and jobfinders'\ngrants to cover the transitional costs of moving into work. After 13 weeks, participants will\nbe offered a range of work experience opportunities, through private training organisations and\nvoluntary or charitable bodies. The jobs offered might include painting and decorating,\nconstruction or gardening work.

Career Development Loans (CDL)\nInitially interest-free loans for people who want to take up job-related training and finance it\nthemselves.\nAnnounced: National extension announced 20 July 1988:21\nCareer Development Loans\nMr. Bowis: To ask the Secretary of State for\nEmployment whether he intends to make career\ndevelopment loans available nationally; and if he will\nmake a statement.\nMr. Fowler: From today career development\nloans are available throughout Great Britain. We have\npiloted career development loans from April 1986 in\nfour areas. Evaluation has shown that they are a very\nuseful addition to the training infrastructure of the\ncountry. During the pilot a total of almost £1.4 million\npounds has been lent to more than 650 people to\nundertake a wide range of vocational training. Career\ndevelopment loans will continue to be run in\npartnership with the three banks which participated in\nthe pilot, Barclays, the Clydesdale and the Co-\noperative. Anyone aged 18 or over who lives or\nintends to train in Great Britain will be able to apply.\nThe Government provide an incentive to borrowers by\npaying the interest on the loan during the period of\ntraining and for up to three months afterwards and\nguarantee a proportion of the loans to make it easier\nfor the banks to consider lending for vocational\ntraining. The costs of the expanded scheme will be met\nfrom within the existing resources of the Department.\nStarted: On a pilot basis in April 1986. Nationally, in July 1988.\nEligibility: Applicants must be aged 18 or over; not in receipt of a mandatory award for\neducation or training; and intending to use the training to work in the United Kingdom or\nelsewhere in the European Community. In addition, the course must be vocational and\ndesigned to help the applicant to get a job.\nTerms: Applicants must apply to a participating bank - the Clydesdale, Barclays, the Co-\noperative, and, since January 1995, the Royal Bank of Scotland - before the start of the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n21 HC Deb 20 July 1988, c 620W\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\ncourse. There is a minimum loan of £200 and a maximum of £8,000. All loans are \"subject\nto status.\" Loans generally cover up to 80% of course fees, plus the cost of books and\nmaterials for courses lasting up to two years. However, where applicants have been out of\nwork for at least three months before applying, and the local TEC or LEC has endorsed their\napplication, they may cover 100% of course fees. No loan repayments are required during\nthe training period and for up to one month afterwards. Those who are registered unemployed\nwhen repayments should start can defer repayments for up to a further five months. During\nthe deferred repayment period, the Department for Education and Employment pays the\ninterest on the loan. After that the borrower must repay on terms agreed with the bank.22\nAbout one-third of those who take up Career Development Loans are unemployed.\nCost and Numbers: The DfEE Departmental Report published in March 1996 contained\nexpenditure figures for CDLs and Small Firms Training Loans. Small Firms Training Loans\nwere launched in June 1994 to help firms with up to 50 employees to improve the skills of\ntheir employees.

People unemployed for two years or more may be asked to attend a\nRestart Course which is designed to boost confidence and encourage job search activity.\nSince December 1990 there have been benefit penalties for those who refuse to attend. Hence\nthe view that Restart Courses are compulsory.\nAnnounced: Restart was announced by Lord Young, then Secretary of State for\nEmployment, in his statement on Enterprise and Employment on 12 November 1985:26\nFirst, we are asking the Manpower Services\nCommission to ask long-term unemployed people in\nthe pilot areas to a counselling interview at their\nJobcentre. The object will be to see whether they\ncan be placed in suitable jobs  including jobs in the\nexpanding community programme  or in existing\ntraining courses. In addition the MSC will be able to\noffer places on entirely new short training courses\nspecifically designed for those who have been out of\nwork for more than a year. These courses will help\nto assess their potential and aptitudes; to brush up\ntheir basic working skills and to improve the\ntechniques of applying for a job. We shall ask the\nManpower Services Commission to cover as many as\npossible of the long-term unemployed in the pilot\nareas with these new arrangements so that we can\nassess their effectiveness.\nStarted: On a pilot basis in January 1986. Nationally, in July 1986.\nEligibility: The courses are targeted at people aged 18 or over who have been unemployed\nfor 24 months or more. People who have been unemployed for 2 years or more who refuse\nto attend a Restart Course may lose up to 40% of their personal entitlement to Income\nSupport for a period not exceeding the length of the course.

Jobplan Workshops\nWorkshops for people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. They are designed\nto give individual counselling and help in drawing up an action plan for getting back to work.\nPeople referred to Jobplan Workshops after their 12 month Restart interview may suffer\nbenefit penalties if they fail to attend.\nAnnounced: 12 November 1992, at the time of the Autumn Statement. Gillian Shephard,\nthen Secretary of State for Employment, gave details in a Written Answer:28\nA major point of entry into other opportunities will be\nthe new jobplan workshops to be run by the\nEmployment Service. These will advise and assess the\nneeds of people unemployed for a year or more,\nprincipally, those who have not taken up other offers\nof help open to them. The successful experience of\nexisting Restart courses and job review workshops will\nbe drawn on, but the new workshops will offer more\nintensive support, from workshop leaders, including\none-to-one advice and guidance, new computer-aided\nguidance and an enhanced action plan. Those\ncompleting workshops will have priority access to\nother programmes. It is expected that around 300,000\npeople will pass through the programme in 1993-94.\nEmployment Service advisers will offer places in job\nplan workshops to all those out of work for a year who\nhave not taken up an offer of help back to work. As is\ncurrently the case with Restart courses offered to\npeople unemployed for two years those who do not\ntake up places offered to them may lose their benefit\nfor a period of time. The social security advisory\ncommittee will be consulted shortly about the benefit\nfor non-attendance in these circumstances.\nStarted: 29 March 199329\nEligibility: To be eligible, people must have been unemployed and in receipt of benefit for\n12 months or more. At their 12 month Restart interview, such people will be required to\nattend a Jobplan Workshop if they refuse or fail to take up other options offered. Failure to\nattend the Workshop may result in a reduction of up to 40% of personal entitlement to\nIncome Support for the duration of the course. Those who do attend continue to receive their\nnormal benefit entitlement.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n28 HC Deb 12 November 1992, c 904W\n29 Dept. of Employment Press Notice, 29 March 1993: \"Jobplan Workshops Boost for 300,000 Long Term\nJobless\"\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nAdministration: The Workshops are run by specialist organisations from the private, public\nand voluntary sectors under contract to the Employment Service.

The number\ngrew during 1985/6 and a major expansion was announced by Lord Young, then Secretary\nof State for Employment, on 9 October 1986:40\n\"A major expansion in the number of Jobclubs from 250 at\npresent to 1,000 by March 1987 and, if the need continues, to\n2,000 by September 1987. Jobclubs are self-help groups with\nexpert help and free facilities to members looking for work. Two\nout of three people leaving Jobclubs go into work, the average\nstay is 5 weeks, and the average number of members is 30. For\nthe first time the private sector will be invited to help run\nJobclubs.\"\n\"Turning to the planned expansion in Jobclubs of up to 2,000\nover the next twelve months Lord Young said: \"Jobclubs are a\ngreat success story. They help unemployed people find jobs for\nthemselves by providing free telephones and postage and expert\nhelp in writing job applications. Two-thirds of people leaving\nJobclubs go into employment. That record speaks for itself. And\nthat is why we are going for a big expansion.\"\"\nEligibility: People aged 18 or over who have been unemployed for 26 weeks. Certain\ngroups (eg people with disabilities, the victims of large-scale redundancies, labour market\nreturners etc.) can gain immediate entry. Rights to benefit are not affected while attending\nthe Clubs. Travel costs to the Job Club are re-imbursed.\nAdministration: The Clubs are usually run by specialist providers under contract to the\nEmployment Service. Job Club leaders help with compiling CVs, completing application\nforms, and improving interview and telephone techniques. Attenders have free use of\ntelephones, stationery, photocopiers, directories, trade magazines etc.. There are some\nspecialist Job Clubs to help disadvantaged people such as former detainees and those nearing\nrelease from prison. There are also some Executive and Management Job Clubs.\nDuration: Participants are expected to attend on 4 half days a week.

Travel to Interview\nA scheme which assists unemployed people to attend job interviews which are beyond normal\ndaily travelling distance. It replaced the Job Search Scheme, the Employment Transfer\nScheme and the Free Forward Fares Scheme in 1986.\nAnnounced: On a national basis, 13 June 1986, by the Manpower Services Commission:55\n\"More people will get financial help with travel costs incurred when going\nto job interviews, the Manpower Services Commission announced today.\nA new scheme - the Travel to Interview Scheme - starts on Monday 16\nJune following a successful 'pilot' in the Northern Region during the past\nyear where it was found to be a simpler scheme to operate and a more\ncost effective way of helping people in their search for work. It is\nanticipated that some 18,000 people will take advantage of the nationwide\nscheme.\nDesigned to help unemployed people with the costs of attending job\ninterviews outside their home areas, the £500,000 Scheme replaces the Job\nSearch Scheme and the main differences in the rules are:\n the local labour market rule will no longer apply as the new scheme is not\ntied to filling skill shortage vacancies;\n assistance is limited to people who have been unemployed for at least four\nweeks before the date of the job offer;\n no subsistence rates are paid.\"\nStarted: 16 June 1986, following a pilot in the Northern region.\nEligibility: The rules were changed from 1 April 1996 so that it now applies to people who\nhave been unemployed for 13 weeks or more and are claiming benefit.

The Job Interview Guarantee will help employers\nchoose the right people for the right jobs.\"\nThe initiative will initially be offered in 20 Inner City areas and will be\navailable from the Spring. It will link the assistance already offered by\njobclubs and the Employment Service with new measures. These will include\na Job Preparation Course, similar to the current Restart course model but with\nemployers involved in tailoring the course content to meet their specific needs.\n'Work Trials' will offer short periods of work experience with potential\nemployers to the unemployed whilst they remain on benefit, allowing\nemployers to reassure themselves about employing people who have been out\nof work for some time.\nIn return for this enhanced service, employers will enter into formal\nagreements with the Employment Service in which they guarantee to interview\nJob Interview Guarantee clients for the vacancies they have available.\nMr Fowler said, \"This initiative is intended for people who are ready for\nemployment. However there may be some who, through a work trial, will\nrealise that they have training needs that Employment Training might meet.\nFor those people, training under ET, tailored to employer's needs can be made\navailable.\"\"\nStarted: On a pilot basis, in 20 inner city areas, from September 1989.60 It became a\nnational programme from April 1991.61\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n59 Dept. of Employment Press Notice, 9 March 1989\n60 The pilot areas are listed in a written answer, HC Deb 14 July 1989, c 654W\n61 HC Deb 2 November 1994, c 1126W\n35\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nEligibility: People aged 18 or over who have been unemployed for 26 weeks or more.\nCertain groups (eg people with disabilities, victims of large scale redundancies, labour market\nreturners etc.) qualify for immediate entry.\nAdministration: JIG originally contained five components, any combination of which may\nhave been used in a particular case:\n Matching and Screening - to make sure the employer only sees a small selection of\nsuitably qualified candidates.\n Customised Training - the Employment Service brings together employers and TECs\nto provide courses tailored to the employer's needs.

Workstart\nA pilot scheme designed to test the effectiveness of offering employers a job subsidy to take\non the long-term unemployed.\nAnnounced: 16 March 1993. Norman Lamont, in his Budget Statement, said:63\nThose who have been unemployed for a long time\ntend to lose touch with the job market, and the\nproblem is that they find it increasingly difficult to\nfind an employer who wants to take them on. We\npropose to test in pilot schemes the feasibility and\neffectiveness of a new approach, under which rather\nthan pay benefit to the long-term unemployed to do\nnothing, payments will instead be made, for a limited\nperiod, to an employer who recruits them.\nEmployers taking on people who have been out of\nwork for at least two years will receive a one-year\nsubsidy based on the benefits which would otherwise\nhave been paid. That subsidy will taper off as the\nperiod of employment progresses. Pilot schemes using\ndifferent approaches will be launched this summer in\nfour parts of the country.

Under the scheme, employers were paid\na subsidy of £60 a week for 6 months, falling to £30 for the following six months, to take on\nlong-term unemployed people. There were four pilot areas, two pilots being run by TECs and\ntwo by the Employment Service:\n \n• Tyneside TEC, covering the cities of Newcastle and the districts of Wallsend,\nGateshead and South Shields\n• Devon and Cornwall TEC, covering the counties of Devon and Cornwall.

Recruitment to these two pilots ended in\nMarch 1996.66 They were designed to explore \"various subsidy possibilities\":67\n• In the North West, the incentive to the employer depends on the length of\nunemployment: £700 for those unemployed for 2-3 years; £1,400 for those\nunemployed for 3-4 years; £2,800 for those unemployed for 4 years or more. Some\nunemployed people are given vouchers to present to prospective employers.\n• In the West Midlands, the value of the subsidy varies between £700 and £2,800.\nEmployment Service staff negotiate with employers over the exact amount in each\ncase. The duration of the subsidy ranges from 3 to 12 months.68\nTwo further pilots, in which employers are offered £1,000 recruitment grants to take on the\nlong-term unemployed were subsequently announced.

Extended nationally, following an\nannouncement in the Budget on 29 November 1994, on 18 April 1995.\nDetails: The pilot scheme provided a grant to people who had been unemployed for two\nyears or more who found a full-time permanent job paying less than £250 a week. The grant\nwas piloted at two levels:\n £100 in the West Midlands areas of Birmingham, Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton\nand Walsall; and;\n £200 in the East Midlands region, covering Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire,\nNottinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.77\n4,708 grants were awarded under these pilots.78\nThe national scheme pays a grant of £200 to people who have been unemployed for two years\nwho find a full time job paying up to £150 a week.79 There is a savings limit of £2,800.80\nIf the recipient fails to start work or leaves during the first six weeks, the grant is repayable.81\nIncluded within the national scheme, are two further pilots. The pilot in the South West will\ntest the use of a grant varying in size with the length of unemployment. The levels will be\n£200 at 2 years, £300 at 3 years and £400 at 4 years or more.

Back to Work Bonus\nA scheme, due to be introduced in October 1996, which will allow unemployed people who\nwork part-time to be credited with half of their earnings up to £1,000 so that they can be paid\nit as a lump sum bonus if they get a full-time job and leave benefit. Legislation authorising\nthis bonus is contained in the Jobseeker's Act 1995 and the Social Security (Back to Work\nBonus) Regulations 1996 SI No 193.\nAnnounced: 12 October 1994 by Peter Lilley, Secretary of State for Social Security, at the\nConservative Party Conference. Mr. Lilley gave more details in his statement to the House\non the Jobseeker's Allowance on 24 October 1994 and in the White Paper on the \"Jobseeker's\nAllowance\" published that day:86\n\"Back to Work Bonus\n4.31 As outlined in 2.14ff a new scheme is to be introduced which will\nreward individuals and their partners who take part-time work whilst\nreceiving JSA, and will provide them with a greater incentive to move\ninto employment of 16 hours or more.\n4.32 The Back to Work Bonus will start when people have been\nunemployed for three months or more. As now, they will keep the first\n£5 of any part-time earnings, while a couple will keep the first £10.\nPart-time earnings over that level will reduce JSA pound for pound, as\nhappens now in Income Support. The Bonus scheme will provide\nunemployed people and their partners with an entitlement to a credit\nequal to 50% of earnings above the £5 limit. That credit will\naccumulate as long as people remain unemployed (subject to certain\nlimits) and will be paid as a cash lump sum when they or their partners\nmove into full-time work (16 hours or more a week, 24 hours or more\nfor partners). As an example, people earning £30 a week will have\ntheir JSA reduced by £25 a week. But £12.50 a week will be accrued\nunder the Back to Work Bonus. If they then return to work 20 weeks\nlater, they will receive a lump sum of £250.\n4.33 If both partners work and benefit is claimed on a means-tested basis\nthen both sets of earnings will help to build up the bonus. The\nmaximum amount of bonus which may be accumulated at any one time\nis £1,000 - a significant sum which will help with the varied costs\nwhich are incurred on making the transition into work. The scheme\nwill encourage those in receipt of JSA to keep in touch with the labour\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n86 Cm 2687\n45\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nmarket, improve their employment prospects and reward those who\nmake the step to full-time work.\"\nCosts and Numbers: The Compliance Cost Assessment on the Back to Work Bonus\nRegulations expected \"that at least 140,000 unemployed people will receive the bonuses in\na full year once the scheme reaches its steady state, probably in 1998/99, and a further 10,000\nincome support claimants should also qualify\".87\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n87 DSS, DfEE, January 1996\n46\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nV.

Earnings Top-Up\nA pilot social security benefit scheme, starting in October 1996 and supplementing the\nearnings of single people and couples without children, on low wages, in the same way as\nFamily Credit boosts the income of low paid workers with children.\nAnnounced: 29 November 1994. In his Budget Statement, Kenneth Clarke said:\n\"But childless and single people account for two thirds of the long term\nunemployed. These people, of course, cannot, at present, claim family\ncredit. I would like to examine whether introducing a new in-work benefit\nfor childless people would be effective.\nThis is obviously a very big step and I have agreed with my right\nhonourable Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security that we should\ntry it out on an experimental basis. We intend to test run a new benefit\nthrough a pilot scheme covering 20,000 people. If the pilot shows that the\nbenefit helps to get childless couples and single people back into work, we\nwill then consider introducing a national scheme.\"95\nFurther details were announced in a Consultation Paper issued on 5 July 199596 and in a\nWritten Statement on the same day:97\nMr. Roger Evans: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for\nSocial Security has today published a consultation paper, \"Piloting change\nin Social Security  Helping people into work\". This sets out the\nGovernment's proposals to test out in eight pilot areas a new in-work\nbenefit. The benefit is designed to make work more rewarding for those with\nlimited earnings power, by enhancing their earnings. It is called earnings\ntop-up.\nIt will be directed towards people without dependent children and\nwill complement family credit which already helps some 600,000 lower paid\nworkers with children.\nThe proposed earnings top-up will increase the rewards of work by an\naverage of about £23 a week for a couple without dependent children and\nabout £19 for a single person of 25 or over. The Government propose to test\nthe effectiveness of two different rates in the pilot areas. The maximum\nlevel of help could be up to £54 a week.\nThe proposals mark the first occasion in the UK in which a social security\nbenefit will be tested out on a pilot basis. The extension of in-work benefits\nto all people on low incomes would be a major step. There is no experience\nfrom any other country on which to draw.

Such a decision would only be taken if the pilot\nscheme proves its worth.\nThe pilot scheme will cost about £75 million over three years, before taking\naccount of behavioural effects. Parliamentary approval for expenditure on the\nscheme will depend on the Appropriations Act via an appropriate reference\nin the departmental estimates. Introduction of a new benefit on a local and\ntemporary basis does not require express statutory authority. The scheme\nwill be subject to detailed rules governing conditions of entitlement,\nclaiming and other matters normally covered in regulations. These will be\nset out in a publicly available document and Parliament will be given an\nopportunity to discuss its principle and details. If it is decided to proceed\nfrom a temporary pilot to a permanent national scheme, the Government will\nintroduce the necessary primary legislation.\nStarting: On a pilot basis in October 1996 in parts of the following areas: the North\nEast, Yorkshire, Wales, Essex, the South Coast and Scotland.98 The pilots are due to last\nthree years.\nDetails: Earnings Top-Up will be a social security benefit paid to childless people who\nwork 16 or more hours a week on much the same lines as Family Credit. It is an extra-\nstatutory scheme, but the draft rules were debated in the House on 24 November 1995.99 Two\nbenefit rates will be tested. The lower rate (Scheme A) will give an estimated average weekly\nboost to income of £16 for single people under 25 and £24 for couples. The higher rate will\ngive an estimated average weekly boost to income of £18 for single people under 25 and £25\nfor couples.100 People qualify for the maximum credit if they earn below the \"threshold\".\nUnder Scheme A this is £46.80 for single person aged 18-25, £56.50 for a single person aged\n25-65, and £73 for a couple. Under scheme B, the threshold is £73 for all. The maximum\ncredit is £22.10 for a single person under 25, £27.20 for a single person aged 25 or over, and\n£45.10 (£54.40 in scheme B) for a couple. A 70% taper withdraws benefit on incomes above\nthe threshold. There is a £10 premium for those working 30 hours or more a week.101\nCost and Numbers: The cost will be about £75 million over three years.102 The number\nreceiving earnings top-up is expected to rise to 20,000 over the three year period.103\nTax Status: Exempt from tax.104\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n98 DSS Press Release, 6 November 1995, Earnings top-Up Pilot Areas Announced\n99 DSS, Earnings Top-Up.

Lone Parent Caseworker Pilot\nA pilot scheme designed to help lone parents find work which will start in April 1997.\nAnnounced: By Peter Lilley, Secretary of State for Social Security in a press notice\naccompanying the Budget on 28 November 1995:\n\"I will also be introducing a pilot scheme from April 1997 which will provide\nindividual help with job search and assistance with training for work. This\nprogramme could help up to 25,000 lone parents. As part of this pilot we will\nbe seeking to provide funding for private and voluntary agencies with\ninnovative schemes. This new programme will cost around £14 million over\nthe PES period.\"105\nStarting: April 1997\nDetails: The details of the scheme are still being worked out and its name has not yet been\nfinally decided. It is likely that the scheme will involve bringing together advice on\nemployment, training, benefits and childcare for lone parents in one central place. Funding\nwill be available for private and voluntary agencies with innovative schemes. There will be\nliterature explaining the social security benefits available to lone parents who work or train,\nthe various employment and training schemes on offer, and the local childcare facilities. It\nis possible that the money allocated to the pilots may be used to fund return to work courses\nfor lone parents run by voluntary organisations, to subsidise childcare for lone parents on\nTraining For Work courses run by TECs or to encourage TECs to provide courses on a part-\ntime basis, with flexible hours which would make it easier for lone parents to participate.106\nCost and Numbers: The total programme will cost about £14 million over three years from\nApril 1996 and it may reach up to 25,000 lone parents.107\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n105 DSS Press Release, 28 November 1995, \"Peter Lilley announces changes to benefits for families\"\n106 Source: DSS\n107 DSS Departmental Report, March 1996, Cm 3213, p 31\n51\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nZ. Child Maintenance Bonus \nA social security benefit, to be introduced in April 1997, which is designed to encourage\nsingle parents in receipt of maintenance to return to work. Legislation for the bonus is\ncontained in the Child Support Act 1995.\nAnnounced: In the White Paper, \"Improving Child Support\", in January 1995:108\n\"There have been calls to extend a maintenance disregard into Income Support\nas well. The Government takes the view that this is not desirable because, like\nany other increase in out-of-work benefit disregards, it would reduce the clear\nwater between in- and out-of work benefits and thus make it more difficult to\nbe better off in work. However, the Government accepts that the current\nsituation, where maintenance payments to parents with care on Income support\nreduce benefit pound for pound, may discourage some absent parents, and may\nbe seen as unfair by parents with care whose former partners are meeting their\nobligations.\nSo that parents with care on Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance who\nreceive maintenance can see a direct benefit from it, the Government intends\nto introduce by primary legislation a scheme building on the principles of the\nBack to Work Bonus proposed in the Jobseeker's Allowance bill. For each\nweek in which maintenance is paid, a parent with care will receive a credit of\n£5 (or the actual amount of the maintenance if less), which will be payable as\na lump sum when she leaves Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance to take\nup work of 16 hours or more. This will provide a substantial incentive to take\nup work and will ease any financial problems during the transition.\"\nStarting: April 1997\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n108 Cm 2745, paras 5.4 - 5.5\n52\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nII Training and Employment Schemes since the War\n1945 - 1971\nIt was not until the 1970's that training and employment schemes of the kind we know today\nwere first introduced. In the two decades which followed the Second World War, the\nGovernment's \"full employment\" policy was so successful that unemployment never exceeded\n3% and was generally below 2%. Manpower policies were developed in the 1960s to deal\nwith regional imbalances and with skill shortages in particular sectors. For example, the\nRegional Employment Premium , a labour subsidy paid to manufacturers for each worker\nthey employed in Development Areas, was introduced in 1967 : and the Industrial Training\nBoards with powers to levy employers and make grants to those who provided training of an\napproved standard, were established under the Industrial Training Act of 1964.\nPublic help with job search activity can be dated back at least to 1910 when the first public\nlabour exchanges were set up as a means of bringing together employers and unemployed\npeople with a view to cutting out waste in the processes of recruiting workers and of looking\nfor a job. From the outset, labour exchanges had close links with the administration of\nunemployment insurance and, by the 1960s, a large network of local offices of the Ministry\nof Labour dealt with both employment and benefit work. On the employment side, the\nservice had a reputation for dealing with poorly motivated people and with vacancies in\npredominantly unskilled occupations. The late 1960s saw a growing interest in manpower\npolicies and there was concern about shortage of labour as a constraint on economic growth.\nIn 1971, the Government published a policy document, \"People and Jobs\", which\nrecommended the separation of employment work from the administration of benefit to break\nthe \"dole queue image\" of the employment service. Attractive new Job Centres in prime high\nstreet locations would help people find work while Unemployment Benefit Offices (UBOs)\nwould deal with benefit claims.\n1972\nTraining Opportunities Scheme (TOPS) - ran from 1972 to 1985 when it was replaced by\nthe Job Training Scheme. The aims of TOPS were to provide training on request from\nunemployed adults, subject to an economic need for the skills to be taught, to enable adults\nto change occupations quickly and to promote the concept of adult retraining. Applicants had\nto be unemployed or willing to give up employment, be at least 19 years of age, and to have\nspent at least two years away from full-time education. They also had to have a clear\nintention of taking up employment in the training occupation. A weekly allowance was paid.\nCommunity Industry (CI) - started in 1972, on the initiative of the National Association of\nYouth Clubs. CI provides disadvantaged young people with temporary employment of\ncommunity benefit in workshops, site projects and through placements with social care\norganisations. It is aimed at the least able 16-19 year olds who fall outside the scope of YTS.\n53\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nParticipants receive a weekly wage which increases with age. They are normally on the\nscheme for 12 months.\n1973\nJob Centres - the first Job Centre of the type proposed in \"People and Jobs\" opened in\nReading in May 1973. In the following three years a network of Job Centres separate from\nthe UBOs was established. However, in 1987, the Government announced that the job-finding\nservices of the Job Centres were to be re-integrated with the benefit administration and\n\"policing\" functions of UBOs. The two services have now been amalgamated under the\nEmployment Services Agency and the 1200 offices operating throughout Great Britain are\nbeing \"progressively integrated to provide clients with a complete range of services under one\nroof.\" [Employment Service Operational Plan 1992-1993]. \nProfessional and Executive Recruitment - in 1973 the Department of Employment's\nProfessional and Executive Register was restyled as Professional Executive Recruitment,\ndelivered by separate management and charging fees to employers. It provided specialised\nrecruitment services for professional, technical, scientific, supervisory and managerial\nvacancies. In September 1988, PER was privatised and sold to Pergamon Professional and\nFinancial Services plc for £6 million.\n1975\nTemporary Employment Subsidy (TES) - ran from August 1975 to March 1979 when it\nclosed to new applications. The objective was to encourage companies to defer threatened\nredundancies, affecting ten or more workers. The scheme offered a £20 a week subsidy for\na maximum of 12 months for each full-time job maintained.\nJob Creation Programme (JCP) - ran from October 1975 to December 1977 when it closed\nto new applicants. JCP provided full-time, paid work for up to twelve months on projects of\nbenefit to the local community. Priority was given to those aged 16-24 and to those aged\nover 50. Participants received the normal local wage rate for the job up to a defined\nmaximum.\nRecruitment Subsidy for School Leavers (RSSL) - ran from October 1975 to September\n1976. The scheme applied to school leavers in the Summer of 1975 and December 1975.\nThe aim was to encourage private sector employers and the nationalised industries to give\npreference to unemployed school leavers when recruiting staff. Employers were paid a\nsubsidy of £5 per head per school leaver recruited, for a maximum of 26 weeks.\n54\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\n1976\nWork Experience Programme (WEP) - ran from September 1976 to April 1978 when it was\nincorporated in the Youth Opportunities Programme. Employers were asked to give\nunemployed 16-18 year olds a practical introduction to working life for a minimum of 6\nmonths. The young people were paid a weekly allowance.\nYouth Employment Subsidy (YES) - ran from October 1976 to March 1978. A subsidy of\n£10 per week for up to 26 weeks was paid to any private sector or nationalised industry\nemployer who recruited a young person (under 20 on 1.10.76) who had been registered as\ncontinuously unemployed for 6 months or more.\n1977\nJob Release Scheme (JRS) - the full-time Job Release Scheme started in January 1977 and\nclosed to new entrants in January 1988. The part-time scheme started in October 1983 and\nclosed in May 1986. The purpose of the scheme was to encourage older people to retire early\nby paying them an allowance, provided they thereby released a job which was filled by an\nunemployed person.\nSmall Firms Employment Subsidy (SFES) - ran from July 1977 to March 1980 when it\nclosed for new applicants. Small manufacturing firms in the private sector (originally only\nin Special Development Areas) were offered a subsidy of £20 per week for up to 26 weeks\nfor each extra full-time job they created. There was a part-time scheme as well.\n1978\nYouth Opportunities Programme (YOP) - ran from April 1978 to September 1983 when\nit was replaced by the Youth Training Scheme. It provided a programme of up to 12 months\nwork experience and training for unemployed school leavers aged 16-18. A weekly allowance\nwas paid.\nSpecial Temporary Employment Programme (STEP) - ran from April 1978 to March 1981,\nwhen it was replaced by the Community Enterprise Programme. Provided the long-term\nunemployed with temporary work of community benefit. Aimed at over 25s unemployed for\nat least 12 months and those aged 19 to 24 unemployed for at least 6 months.\nShort-Time Working Compensation Scheme for Textile, Clothing and Footwear Firms -\nran from May 1978 to March 1979 when it closed to new applicants and was subsumed in\nthe Temporary Short Time Working Compensation Scheme. The scheme aimed to encourage\nemployers in these industries to adopt short-time working instead of making people redundant.\n55\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nFor a maximum of 12 months, employers were re-imbursed 75% of normal wages paid to\nthose working short-time instead of redundancy.\nAdult Employment Subsidy (AES) - ran from August 1978 to June 1979 in a few pilot\nareas. Employers in private industry and the nationalised industries received £20 per week\nsubsidy for up to 26 weeks for every person they took on aged 19-64 (59 for women) who\nhad been registered unemployed for 12 months or more.\n1979\nTemporary Short Time Working Compensation Scheme (TSTWCS) - ran from April 1979\nto March 1984. The scheme was designed to encourage employers to adopt short-time\nworking as an alternative to redundancy. Under the scheme, employers received 50% of\nnormal wages paid to staff working short-time for up to nine months.\n1981\nCommunity Enterprise Programme (CEP) - ran from April 1981 to September 1982 when\nit was incorporated in the Community Programme. Provided temporary employment of\nbenefit to the Community for the long-term unemployed with a view to improving their\nprospects of obtaining permanent employment. Aimed at over 25s unemployed for at least\n12 months and those aged 18 to 24 unemployed for at least six months.\n1982\nYoung Workers Scheme - ran from January 1982 to April 1986, when it was replaced by\nthe New Workers Scheme. The aim of the scheme was to improve the competitive position\nof young people in the labour market in order to \"price\" them into jobs. Employers were paid\na subsidy of £15 a week for each young person aged 18 in their first year of employment, and\nearning under £50 a week.\nVoluntary Projects Programme (VPP) - ran from August 1982 to September 1988 when it\nwas replaced by Employment Training. The projects offered unemployed people an\nopportunity to undertake constructive activities on a informal, part-time basis. Participants\nremained on benefit. The Manpower Services Commission funded some of the running costs\nand waged posts of the sponsors who were usually voluntary organisations.\nCommunity Programme (CP) - ran from October 1982 to September 1988 when it was\nreplaced by Employment Training. Provided certain unemployed people over 18 with up to\na year's temporary full - or part-time work on projects of benefit to the Community.\nParticipants aged 18-24 had to have been out of work for 6 of the previous 9 months. Those\n56\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\naged 25 or over had to have been unemployed for 12 of the previous 15 months. From\nOctober 1984, most participants had to have been in receipt of unemployment benefit.\nParticipants were paid a wage (the rate for the job) up to an average of £67 a week.\n1983\nJob Splitting Scheme - ran from January 1983 to April 1987 when it was replaced by\nJobshare. Employers were paid a grant (originally £750) if they split a job which had\npreviously been full-time and filled it with two unemployed workers or two employees facing\nredundancy.\nEnterprise Allowance Scheme (EAS) - ran, nationally, from August 1983 to 1990-91 when\nit was gradually replaced by the Business Start Up Scheme run on a more flexible basis by\nthe Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs). Originally the scheme provided an allowance\nof £40 a week for up to a year for people who had been unemployed for at least 8 weeks and\nwho wanted to start their own businesses. Claimants had to be aged 18-65 and have access\nto £1000 capital.\nYouth Training Scheme (YTS) - ran from September 1983 to May 1990 when it was\nreplaced by Youth Training. YTS was a programme of training and planned work experience\nfor 16 and 17 year old school leavers. It started as a one year programme but was\nsubstantially revised and became a two year programme in April 1986. Trainees were paid\nan allowance of £29.50 a week in their first year and £35 a week in their second year.\n1984\nJob Clubs - see Part I\n1985\nJob Training Scheme (JTS) - ran from July 1985 to September 1988 when it was replaced\nby Employment Training. The scheme provided training for unemployed people, mainly\nthrough off-the-job courses at Skill-centres and further education colleges. The courses lasted\nfrom 3 to 12 months and trainees received an allowance of £38 a week if single or £62.70\nif they had an adult dependant. Trainees had to be 18 or over and to have been away from\nfull-time education for at least two years.\nWider Opportunities Training Programme - ran from July 1985 to September 1988 when\nit was replaced by Employment Training. The scheme provided typically short-term and part-\ntime training for unemployed people. Training included work preparation, assessment and\nbasic skills training, training in literacy and numeracy, English as a second language and\n57\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nspecial help for women returners to the labour market. Most trainees continued to receive\nbenefit but a few, on full-time courses, were paid the old Job Training Scheme allowances.\n1986\nNew Workers Scheme - ran from April 1986 to January 1988. The aim of the scheme was\nto encourage employers to take on more young people at rates of pay which realistically\nreflected their age and inexperience. Employers were paid £15 a week for up to a year for\neach eligible young person they took on. Young people aged 18 or 19 had to be paid a wage\nbelow £55 a week and those aged 20, a wage below £65. The young people had to be in\ntheir first year of employment.\nJobstart - ran from July 1986 to February 1991. Under the scheme, people who had been\nunemployed and claiming benefit for at least 12 months could receive an allowance of £20\na week for up to 6 months if they took a full-time job with gross pay of under £90 a week.\nA pilot \"50-Plus Jobstart\" scheme, launched in June 1989, allowed qualifying people aged 50\nor over to receive the allowance if they took a part-time job for at least 10 hours a week at\nan hourly rate of £2.57 or less.\nTravel To Interview Scheme - see Part I\nRestart Courses - see Part I\nCareer Development Loans - see Part I\n1987\nNew Job Training Scheme - ran, on a national basis, from April 1987 to September 1988\nwhen it was replaced by Employment Training. The scheme provided full-time training and\nwork experience for an average of 6 months to people who had been unemployed for 6\nmonths or more. Priority went to 18-25 year olds. Trainees received an allowance of £25\na week or the equivalent of their benefit, whichever was the higher. From April 1988 a\ntraining premium of £10 a week was paid on top of this.\nJobshare - ran from April 1987 to December 1991 when it closed to new applicants. Under\nthe scheme, employers who created part-time jobs for unemployed people could qualify for\na grant of £1000 towards administration and training costs. Jobs could be created by splitting\nan existing full-time post; combining regular overtime hours into a new job; or creating two\nnew part-time jobs. The jobs had to be filled by people claiming unemployment benefit,\nunder notice of redundancy or leaving Government training schemes such as Employment or\nYouth Training.\n58\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\n1988\nEmployment Training - ran from September 1988 to 1993, when it was merged with\nEmployment Action to form Training For Work. The programme was aimed primarily at the\nlong term adult unemployed. 18-24 year olds who had been unemployed for 6-12 months\nwere the \"guarantee\" group and 18-50 year olds who had been unemployed for more than two\nyears were the \"aim group\". Many other groups (eg anyone unemployed for 6 months or\nmore, aged 18-60; the disabled; people whose first language is not English; certain lone\nparents; labour market returners) could qualify. The programme provided up to a year (later\nup to 2 years in some cases) training, designed to qualify people for work. A training\nallowance equal to benefit entitlement plus a £10 premium was paid. The scheme was run\nby the TECs who had a certain amount of flexibility in the details.\n1989\nAction Credit - pilot scheme introduced in 1989. Allowed benefit claimants who leave\nEmployment Training to work part-time for up to 6 months while continuing to receive\nincome support. The earnings are saved and paid as a lump sum when a full-time job is\nfound, or after the part-time job comes to an end. The pilot does not appear to have been\nvery successful and the scheme has been adopted by very few TECs.\nJob Interview Guarantee/Work Trials - see Part I\n1990\nYouth Training - see Part I\nTraining and Enterprise Councils (TECs) - a network of 82 independent, local, employer-\nled councils which have been established throughout England and Wales to \"promote more\neffective training by employers and individuals\" and \"to stimulate enterprise and growth\".\nThe first came into operation in April 1990 and the entire network was operational by October\n1991. The Government has devolved responsibility for administering the main training\nschemes (notably Youth Training and Training For Work and any schemes for small business\ntraining) to these TECs. It has also given them considerable flexibility in how they run the\nschemes so it is no longer quite so easy to talk in terms of national \"training schemes\". The\nScottish equivalent are Local Enterprise Companies (LECs) of which there are 22.\n1991\nTraining Credits - see Part I, under Youth Credits\n59\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nJob Review Workshops - see Part I\nJob Search Seminars - see Part I\nEmployment Action - ran from October 1991 to 1993 when it was merged with Employment\nTraining to form \"Training for Work\". The scheme was aimed at 18-60 year olds who had\nbeen continuously unemployed for at least 6 months. They received an average of 6 months\nwork on projects of community benefit and help with finding permanent work. Participants\nreceived their social security benefit entitlement plus an allowance of £10 a week. The\nscheme was mainly run by TECs.\nBusiness Start Up (BSUS) - ran, nationally, from about April 1991 to March 1995. It\nreplaced the Enterprise Allowance Scheme as a more flexible form of help for unemployed\npeople who wanted to start their own businesses. It was administered by TECs. The general\nrule was that people had to be aged between 18 and 59 and unemployed for at least six weeks\nto qualify. TECs set the level of the allowance which could vary between £20 and £90 a\nweek and last for between 26 and 66 weeks. The scheme was transferred from the\nDepartment of Employment to the Single Regeneration Budget in April 1994. From April\n1995 there has been no separate financial allocation for BSUS. TECs may join a consortium\nbidding for SRB money and may use some of the funds they win to run schemes like BSUS\nbut there is no longer a national scheme or national parameters. The TEC Operating\nAgreement for 1995/96 says that TECs \"shall recruit no further participants in 1995/96.\" \n1993\nTraining for Work - see Part I\nCommunity Action (CA) - ran from 1993 to 1996, with recruitment to the programme\nceasing on 29 December 1995. This was a programme designed to help people who had been\nunemployed for at least 12 months back into work by providing part-time work experience\non projects of benefit to the local community and assistance with job search. The closure of\nthe programme was announced at the time of the November 1995 Budget [HC Deb 28\nNovember 1985, c 685W and DfEE Press Notice, 28 November 1995, \"Shephard announces\n£878m more for schools\"]. Its closure was linked with the introduction of pilot Project Work\nschemes, though these were not a direct replacement for CA.\nWorkstart - see Part I\nLearning For Work - operated during the academic year 1993/94. It was announced by\nNorman Lamont in his Budget on 16 March 1993 [HC Deb. c 193]. To qualify, people had\nto be aged 18-60 and to have been registered unemployed continuously for 52 weeks or more\n60\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\non 1 September 1993. It was run by TECs and LECs and provided full-time vocational\ncourses at local colleges. Participants received an allowance equal to their previous benefit\nrate. 30,000 starts were planned but take-up was lower than expected.\nJobplan Workshops - see Part I\n1994\nWorkwise/Worklink - see Part I\n1-2-1 - see Part I\nModern Apprenticeships - see Part I\nJobfinder's Grant - see Part I\n1995\nAccelerated Modern Apprenticeships (aMAs) - This scheme was similar to Modern\nApprenticeships but aimed at 18 and 19 year old school leavers. It was announced by David\nHunt, then Secretary of State for Employment in a statement on the White Paper,\n\"Competitiveness: Helping Business to Win\", on 24 May 1994. It was to start from\nSeptember 1995, but, because of very low take-up (only 400 participants in December\n1995109) was merged with Modern Apprenticeships from April 1996. 110\nJob Match - see Part I\nCareer Development Loans Plus - see Part I\n1996\nBack to Work Bonus - see Part I\nProject Work - see Part I\nEarnings Top-Up - see Part I\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n109 HC Deb 16 April 1996, c 391W\n110 DfEE Press Notice, 7 February 1996, \"Further expansion of Modern Apprenticeships\"\n61\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nNational Insurance Contribution Holidays - see Part I\nJob Search Plus - see Part I\n1997\nLone Parent Caseworker Pilot - see Part I\nChild Maintenance Bonus - see Part I\n62\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/66\nIII Further Reading\n1.

Draft regulations were published in December 1995 and referred to the\nSocial Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) for comments. The final regulations were laid\nbefore Parliament on 2 April 1996.\nThis paper explains the changes which the regulations will implement and summarises the\nresponses of interested organisations.\nWendy Wilson\nSocial Policy Section\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

In brief the changes will:\n• limit HB (for those under 25) to the average cost of non-self contained\naccommodation in the locality;\n• include some exemptions for particular categories of claimants;\n• require local authorities to pay HB in arrears to private sector tenants who claim on\nor after 7 October 1996;\n• require benefit paid direct to landlords to be sent four-weekly in arrears;\n• give local authorities discretion to make the first payment of HB payable to the\nlandlord in certain specified circumstances.\nThe stated aim of restricting benefit for single people under 25 is:1\n'to ensure that Housing Benefit does not encourage young people to leave the parental home unnecessarily or\nto take on higher priced accommodation at the taxpayers' expense than they could afford from their own\nearnings.'\nOn the system of paying benefit in arrears the Government has said:2\n'The Government has a fundamental obligation to the taxpayer to tackle fraud and error. Paying HB in arrears\nis an important step in the campaign ...These changes will continue to help safeguard tenancies and at the same\ntime will help to protect public funds by reducing overpayments and underpayments of HB.'\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 Department of Social Security press notice 96/09, 2 April 1996\n2 ibid\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nBy giving local authorities discretion to make the first payment of benefit payable to the\nlandlord it is hoped that:3\n'This will help remove the temptation for some claimants to abscond with the first payment of HB without\npaying the landlord.'\nDraft regulations were published in December 1995 and referred to the Social Security\nAdvisory Committee (SSAC) for comments. The SSAC's report, along with the Government's\nresponse, was presented to Parliament in early April.4\nThe SSAC report recommends that more time should be taken to consider the implications\nof paying HB in arrears and to allow the changes which were introduced in January 1996 to\nbe monitored.5 On restricting HB for under 25 year olds the SSAC report recommends that\n'the proposal should not be implemented in its present form'.6 The final regulations were laid\non 2 April 1996;7 they have been amended to take account of some of the SSAC's\nrecommendations on the groups that should be exempt from the changes. It is proposed that\nthese provisions will come into effect from 7 October 1996.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 ibid\n4 Cm 3225\n5 ibid p.4 para 13\n6 ibid p.9 para 33\n7 SI 1996/965\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nII Payment in arrears and direct payments\nA. Background\nUnder current arrangements HB is usually paid in advance; payments must be made within\n14 days of a claim being received. As far as is practicable, HB should be paid two weeks\nbefore the end of the period in respect of which it is made or, in certain circumstances, in\narrears. It is the claimant's responsibility to ensure that the rent is paid to the landlord. The\nGovernment has identified the following problems with this system:8\n• payments in advance contribute to, or fail to prevent, overpayments arising where the\nclaimant fails to report a change of circumstances before a payment is due; \n• some claimants, after having received a substantial payment of benefit (perhaps\nbecause arrears are payable), fail to pay their rent and abscond leaving the landlord\nwith debts;\n• the withdrawal by claimants of consent to HB payments being made direct to\nlandlords without the landlord's knowledge before a determination is made, leading to\nthe landlord not receiving payments when due or to the tenant absconding;\n• interruptions in the pattern of income when people move on and off benefit because\nother forms of income, particularly wages, are paid in arrears.\nB. The Government's proposals\nThe regulations will require local authorities to pay HB in arrears in respect of new claims\nfrom tenants living in privately rented and housing association homes from 7 October 1996.\nA new claim will be one which is not continuous with an earlier claim and will include\nclaimants who change their address on a permanent basis. There will be no change to the\nfrequency of HB payments. Persons who claim benefit as a result of a partner's death will,\nin certain circumstances, not be affected by the new rules. These changes are expected to\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 DSS note to the SSAC on the draft regulations para 7\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nyield £105/120/75 million in the years beginning April 1996, 1997 and 1998 respectively; in\nthe longer term recurring savings have been estimated at £25 million a year at current benefit\nlevels.9\nThe regulations will also amend the rules governing the direct payment of HB so that\nauthorities will be able to make the first payment of benefit in any claim payable to the\nlandlord, although sent to the claimant, where:\n• the claimant has not already fully discharged his or her rental liability for the period\nin question, and\n• the arrangement would be in the interest of the efficient administration of the benefit\nscheme.10\nThe regulations are to be complemented by guidance for local authorities on making payments\nwithin 14 days of the receipt of a claim, on payments on account, notification of landlords\nwhere claimants withdraw consent to direct payments before the determination of a claim and\non local authorities' discretion to make direct payments to landlords where it appears to be\nin the claimant's interest to do so.\nThe Government believes that the new rules will reduce the incidence of overpayments, ease\nthe transition between employment and benefit dependency and bring HB into line with most\nother social security benefits.\nC. Responses\n1. Payment in arrears\nWhilst recognising that there are some administrative advantages in paying HB in arrears, a\nnumber of respondents to the draft regulations feel that the proposal could have an adverse\nimpact on landlords' willingness to let to benefit claimants. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n9 HL Deb 25 April 1996 c.107WA\n10 Guidance on this is provided in HB/CTB Circular A9/96\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\n The Association of District Councils' (ADC) response to the draft regulations concluded:11\n'It is widely acknowledged that benefit claimants are already discriminated against by landlords, primarily\nbecause of their inability to make deposits. Although some local authorities do operate deposit or rent\nguarantee schemes, the resources available are very limited. Clearly, moving to a payment in arrears system\nwill further disadvantage benefit recipients compared to other prospective tenants. Although it is recognised\nthat most social security benefits are paid in arrears it is pointed out that housing costs are usually charged\nfor in advance. Paying benefit in arrears would also not stop some landlord pressurising tenants to find the\nrent due from other limited resources.'\nThe National Association of Estate Agents' submission to the SSAC comments:\n'As the Committee must be aware all landlords require the payment of rent in advance and it, therefore, will\nseriously prejudice the ability of tenants who are on DSS support in being considered for tenancies in the first\ninstance and will place them at a disadvantage against those tenants who are able to pay their rent in advance.'\nThe National Federation of Housing Associations (NFHA) is concerned that the payment of\nHB in arrears will affect associations' cashflow; it has estimated that the measure will\neventually cost £5 million per annum in lost interest and that this will lead directly into\nincreased rents.12 It is also concerned that claimants' rent accounts will routinely be in arrears,\nmaking it more difficult for them to understand their rent statement and establishing a culture\nin which arrears are accepted as the norm.13 \nShelter's submission to the SSAC on the draft regulations draws attention to the fact that\ndelays in processing HB already create disincentives to let to claimants and also refers to the\npotential impact of provisions in the Housing Bill that will reduce the mandatory ground for\npossession for rent arrears from 13 to 8 weeks:\n'Delays in processing claims and failure to make interim payments has been and remains a serious problem\nfor tenants and landlords alike. The proposal to pay housing benefit in arrears in the context of delays lasting\nup to 15 weeks is very likely to worsen the situation. Tenants can expect to receive their benefit later and\nlandlords their rent later. The consequences for tenants and their landlords are serious. Rent arrears, however\ncaused, often leads to the harassment and eventual eviction, legal or otherwise, of innocent tenants.\nIn this context Shelter notes the reference at paragraph 20 to the DoE's Housing Bill which reduces the\nmandatory ground for possession for rent arrears from 13 weeks to 8 weeks arrears of rent. Shelter does not\nagree that the proposed changes by themselves are 'unlikely' to increase the risk of eviction. If the tenancy\nagreement states that the rent is due monthly, housing benefit will be paid monthly in arrears and effectively,\nthe tenant could be subject to mandatory possession proceedings for delaying a payment themselves by only\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n11 para 8\n12 NFHA submission to SSAC on the draft regulations\n13 ibid\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nfour weeks. This will particularly affect tenants who have overlooked paying their rent due to the fact they\nare experiencing personal difficulties, for example, suffering from an illness, undergoing a relationship\nbreakdown, or having had a bereavement.'\nThe Government has responded to concerns over existing HB processing delays with the\ninformation that over 80 per cent of claims are now determined with 14 days of all the\nrelevant information being made available.14\nOn the implications for the administration of the HB system the ADC states:15\nIn recent years local authorities have striven hard to improve their administrative performance, and with some\nsuccess, but this improvement is being threatened by constant changes to the system and the unwillingness\nof the Department to fully reimburse local authorities for the cost of schemes changes. As the Department\nis aware, authorities have just introduced on 2 January a separate scheme for new private sector tenants and\nare in the throes of preparing for the introduction of Extended Payments and Fast Tracking in April.\nAuthorities are also having to cope with changes relating to fraud data matching (July 1996) and Jobseekers\nAllowance (October 1996). A not insignificant number of authorities are further affected by the upheaval of\nLocal Government Reorganisation.\nIf these latest proposals are implemented local authorities will be running in October four concurrent schemes\nfor rent allowance cases and two payment systems. The housing benefit system is arguably the most\ncomplicated benefit to administer in the social security system and we are concerned at the frequency of\nchanges and the constant failure to let recent changes 'bed down' before new changes are proposed. Rather than\nfocus on improved performance and training, senior management time is constantly dominated by\nimplementing scheme changes.'\nThe Government has estimated that the total gross administrative cost to local authorities\narising from the introduction of the new payment rules will be some £3 million but has\nreferred to offsetting savings as a result of a reduction in overpayments of benefit.16\nThe SSAC's report on the draft regulations accepted that paying HB in arrears would prevent\nor reduce fraud, but recommended that the DSS should 'take more time to consider the\nimplications for claimants and the private rented sector, and to allow the changes introduced\nin January 1996 to be monitored.'17 The report also recommended that the Government should\nlook at ways of compensating housing associations for any financial loss incurred if the\nproposals went ahead.18 The Government has rejected both of these recommendations.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 HL Deb 14 May 1996 c.443\n15 ADC submission to SSAC on the draft regulations\n16 HC Deb 20 December 1995 c.1270W\n17 Cm 3225 p.4 para 13\n18 ibid p.4 para 15\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\n2. Direct payments and guidance\nPrivate and housing association landlords have welcomed the proposal to make an initial\npayment of HB payable to the landlord and moves to strengthen guidance on processing\nclaims within 14 days and on payments on account. \nThe SSAC also welcomed these proposals, 'with some reservations', and recommended that\nthey should be monitored.19\nIII Housing Benefit for the under 25s\nA. Background\nEntitlement to HB is calculated by comparing the needs and resources of the claimant, and\nhis or her household where applicable, taking liability for rent payments into account. The\n1988 Social Security Act removed the automatic right of 16 and 17 year olds to Income\nSupport (IS) and introduced a lower rate of IS for those aged under 25 compared with the rate\nfor other adults. Those 16-24 year olds who have an income at or below the IS level are\ncurrently entitled to have 100% of their rent met by HB. However, because younger\nclaimants receive HB at a lower rate than people of 25 and above, they are subject to a\nsteeper HB 'taper' and have assistance withdrawn more rapidly, as their income rises.\nChanges to the HB system which came into effect on 2 January 199620 have meant that most\nnew rent allowance claimants,21 and those who make a new claim after a change of address,\nonly receive HB to cover the whole amount of their rent where their rent levels are at or\nbelow the general level of rents for properties of a similar size in the locality (represented by\nthe local reference rent). Where a claimant's rent level is deemed, by the rent officer, to be\nabove the local reference rent, his or her maximum eligible rent for HB purposes is the local\nreference rent plus half the difference between the two figures. The intention behind these\nchanges was to relate entitlement to HB more closely to the generality of local rents for\nsimilar properties and to give tenants an incentive to negotiate a lower rent or find alternative\ncheaper accommodation. Authorities have discretion to pay HB above the maximum eligible\nrent up to the level of the contractual rent, less ineligible charges, in cases that they judge\nto involve exceptional hardship.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n19 ibid p.5 paras 18 & 22\n20 SI 1995/1644\n21 People living in private rented and housing association accommodation receive HB in the form of a rent allowance\nwhile those in council accommodation receive HB in the form of a rent rebate.\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nEntitlement to HB can also be restricted where an authority believes a claimant's\naccommodation to be unreasonably expensive and/or too large for his or her needs.22\nB. The Government's proposals\nThe DSS's explanatory note on the draft regulations states that around 462,000 young people\nare currently in receipt of HB and of these, around 177,000 (38%) live in the private rented\nsector. In the light of forecasted growth in the number of young people living independently23\nthe Government is concerned to ensure that HB should only meet rents for types of\naccommodation which tenants would be able to afford if they had to meet rent from their own\nresources. As most young people have lower current earnings, the Government proposes to\nlimit HB for single people under the age of 25 to 'the general level of rents payable in the\nlocality for the sort of non self-contained accommodation that they would be expected to\noccupy if they were not in receipt of HB'.24 \nThese measures are expected to result in long-term savings of £65 million. Around 177,000\nsingle young people under 25 are expected to come under the scheme in the longer term, of\nwhich 144,000 (80%) will have their benefit entitlement reduced.25\n1. Single room rent\nThe regulations will require Rent Officers to calculate a 'single room rent level' (SRR) which\nwill reflect the general level of rent for non self-contained accommodation in the locality.\nWhen the regulations come into force single claimants under the age of 25, with some\nexclusions (see below), will have their entitlement to HB assessed with reference to the SRR;\nthis rent level will represent the maximum eligible rent on which HB will be payable. The\nSRR is to be based on genuine market rents for single room accommodation with shared use\nof toilet and kitchen facilities in the locality, excluding rents for accommodation where board\nattendance is included. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n22 regulations 11(2)(a) & 11(2)(c) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 SI 1987/1971\n23 DoE, Projection of Households in England to 2016, states that between 1991 and 2011 the number of single people\nunder 25 will increase by almost 30%.\n24 DSS Note to the SSAC on the draft regulations para 29\n25 ibid para 32\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nThe '50 per cent rule' introduced in January, under which HB will meet half the excess of the\nappropriate rent over the local reference rent, will not apply to people under 25 from 7\nOctober 1996; the reason given for this is:26\n'The circumstances of most single young people are such that it would not be reasonable for them to receive\nHB on rents which are above the general level of rents in the locality for appropriate single person\naccommodation.'\nHousing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (HB/CTB) Circular A11/96 gives examples of how\nbenefit entitlement will be assessed after the introduction of SRRs.\nSince 2 January 1996 prospective HB claimants have been able to obtain pre-tenancy\ndeterminations which give an indication of the level of rent for a particular property which\nis likely to be used to calculate HB. It is proposed that from 7 October 1996 these\ndeterminations will also indicate the SRR for non-self contained accommodation in the\nlocality.\n2. Affected claimants\nIt is proposed that the new arrangements will apply to all new and change of address claims\nfor HB on or after 7 October 1996 and to existing claims which have been assessed under the\nsystem introduced in January 1996 from the first review date (these are usually six monthly)\non or after 7 October 1996. The changes will not affect HB claimants under 25 whose\nentitlement was assessed prior to 2 January 1996 unless they change their address or their\nbenefit entitlement ceases for a period of four weeks or more.\nThe benefit restrictions will apply to single young people until the benefit week of their 25th\nbirthday.\nThe following groups are to be excluded from the new arrangements:\n• married and co-habiting couples;\n• people with care of children;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n26 ibid para 35\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\n• tenants who were the subject of a care order27 and who are under 22 years of age;28\n• tenants of registered housing association dwellings; however, if an authority believes\nthat the rent is unreasonable or the tenant is over accommodated, the case can be\nreferred to the Rent Officer to be assessed under the rules introduced in January\n1996;29\n• people living in hostels for the homeless that are funded by the Resettlement Agency;*\n• people living in accommodation provided by housing associations, registered charities\nand voluntary organisations where care, support or supervision is also provided;*\n• people who qualify for protection from rent restrictions for specified or indefinite\nperiods owing to special circumstances (eg bereavement, disaster).*\n* these groups are also exempt from the January 1996 changes\nIn addition, there are two situations in which authorities will be unable to restrict the\nmaximum rent to the SRR from the outset of the claim:\n• where a claim is made, in respect of the same dwelling, by a young individual who\nis a member of the household as well as a relative, in which a death has occurred, the\nmaximum rent will be either the maximum rent which was in payment prior to the\ndeath or, if there was no maximum rent, the reckonable rent due before the death\noccurred (less an amount for water charges, meals and fuel as appropriate). This will\nbe payable for a period of twelve months from the date of the death;\n• where the authority is satisfied that the claimant or any member of his family in the\nhousehold was able to afford the rent when the tenancy was taken up, no maximum\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n27 under s.31(1)(a) of the Children Act 1989 \n28 Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit Circular A11/96, para 8\n29 ibid\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nrent can be applied for the first 13 weeks of the benefit period, providing there was\nno HB entitlement in the preceding 52 weeks.\n3.  Discretion\nIt is proposed to give authorities discretion to pay above the maximum eligible rent in cases\nthey consider to involve exceptional hardship; this is to be a further application of the system\nof discretionary payments that was introduced as part of the new scheme in January. The\nlevel of funding for discretionary expenditure and the cash-limited Government subsidy for\nthis expenditure is to be adjusted to reflect the possibility of claims for payments from people\nunder 25 whose benefit is further restricted from 7 October 1996. Local authorities will be\nable to decide whether and how to exercise their discretion, subject to an overall limit.\n4.  Subsidy\nLocal authorities will receive maximum (95%) subsidy on benefit paid up to the level of the\nmaximum eligible rent. For cases assessed under the new arrangements, this will be the SRR.\nNo subsidy will be payable on any benefit paid on rent above this level with the exception\nof some cash-limited funding for discretionary payments.\nC. Responses\n1.  Evidence of abuse\nA number of respondents to the draft regulations feel that there is inadequate evidence of\nyoung people taking up tenancies with the assistance of HB which their contemporaries would\nnot normally expect to afford, on which to justify the current proposals; the Social Security\nAdvisory Committee (SSAC) has commented:30\n'We are concerned about current lack of knowledge of the circumstances in which under 25s are living, or\nwhether these confirm the abuses which the Department suspects in paragraph 36 of its note to the Committee.\nWithout this information young people may be subjected to hardship without evidence that there is a serious\nproblem which requires this particular solution.'\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n30 SSAC, The Housing Benefit (General) Amendment Regulations 1996, Cm 3225, April 1996 p.19 para 29\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nThe SSAC has recommended that the Department should collate evidence of any abuses of\nthe system and confirm them in order to justify the proposed changes.31\nRecent research into attitudes to housing carried out by the Office for National Statistics\n(ONS) for the DoE found that young unmarried adults living alone in private rented\naccommodation are less likely to be entitled to housing benefit than other private sector\ntenants and are also less likely to claim even when entitled.32 The ONS survey also found\nan increase in the number of people aged 20 to 24 living at home; almost a half of all men\nand a third of women between these ages live in the parental home.33 These findings, coupled\nwith statistics gathered by Centrepoint which show that around 86 per cent of young homeless\npeople approaching for assistance were forced to leave home by 'push' factors such as abuse\nand family breakdown,34 would seem to indicate that the availability of HB is not a significant\nfactor in encouraging young people to leave home.\nThe Government has noted SSAC's concern about how widespread abuses of the system might\nbe but 'is committed to the principle that, in general, young people who are dependent on\nbenefits should not, with the support of the taxpayer, be able to live in more expensive\naccommodation than young people who support themselves.'35 The Government has accepted\nthat the effects of the changes should be monitored closely but considers that it would be\n'unrealistic and unacceptable to carry out research recommended by the Committee before the\nchanges are in place.'36\n2. Age distinctions\nThe introduction of age distinctions in determining levels of benefit has long proved\ncontroversial. The SSAC report states:37\n'The Committee has stated in previous reports that it can see no justification for paying certain adults (who\nmight have worked and paid taxes) lower amounts of means tested benefits on grounds of age, We do not\naccept that, because younger adults tend to have lower wages than older people, they should therefore receive\nless Income Support and Housing Benefit. We note that the Department, rightly, does not attempt to apply the\nsame argument to pensioners whose incomes tend to be lower than those of people in work. Income Support\nand Housing Benefit are not insurance based benefits, related to past earnings, but take into account current\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n31 Cm 3225 p.9 para 31\n32 ONS, Housing in England 1994/95, April 1996 p.113\n33 ibid p.106\n34 Centrepoint, The New Picture of Youth Homelessness in Britain, 1996\n35 Cm 3225 p.9 para 34\n36 ibid p.10 para 41\n37 ibid p.20 para 30\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nincome and capital, and are intended to provide for essential needs, including security of housing. These needs\ndo not change between the ages of 24 and 25.'\nThe SSAC report concludes that 'any proposal by the Department for any age distinction\nshould be supported by evidence of the behaviour and needs of different age groups.'38\nThe proposition that under 25s on benefit should not occupy self contained accommodation\nhas been rejected by a number of respondents. The SSAC report notes that young adults have\nthe same general preference for independent living as the rest of the population; a comparison\nis made with the fact that there are no proposals to place further restrictions on Income\nSupport for mortgage interest for people under 25.39 \n3. Availability and standard of accommodation\nIt has been widely questioned whether the market for private rented accommodation will\nrespond positively to restrictions on HB for the under 25s by providing more, inexpensive,\nshared accommodation. The Association of District Authorities' (ADC) response to the draft\nregulations states:40\n'Many of our member authorities have commented that non-self contained accommodation is very scarce in\ntheir areas and where it does exist, it is often of poor quality. The poor conditions that can be found in many\nHMOs are well documented and we are concerned that the impact of these new benefit restrictions will be to\nforce individuals into what is, generally, unsatisfactory accommodation.'\nThe Small Landlords Association commented on the future availability of bedsits and shared\naccommodation in its response to the draft regulations:41\n'Feedback from landlords in membership of the Small Landlords Association indicates that there is very serious\nconcern about the latest cocktail of measures and policies affecting the private rented sector and that the\nlikelihood is that the response of landlords will be to reduce the supply of bedsits and shared accommodation\neither by converting such accommodation into self-contained flats or by discontinuing business altogether.\nThe result could be a lack of the sort of accommodation which the proposals feel is appropriate for single\nunder 25s.'\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n38 ibid p.20 para 31\n39 ibid p.20 para 32\n40 para 16\n41 para 17\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nThis view is backed up by the National Association of Estate Agents' response to the draft\nregulations:\n'It is also, in the opinion of a number of our members, going to create an impossible position as the\navailability of shared accommodation is on the decline as many landlords have over the past few years been\nbusy converting these type of HMOs into self-contained units. As such, these units will command higher\nrentals and, therefore, any assessments based on bedsit accommodation with shared facilities made by rent\nofficers will make it nigh impossible for the under 25s to rent this type of accommodation if it is not there\nto be had.'\nThere is some evidence to suggest that private landlords are already reluctant to let to HB\nclaimants owing to delayed payments and extra management difficulties. Research sponsored\nby the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) into the private rented sector in 1994 found, from\na representative sample of landlords in Britain, that three-quarters of the landlords (or their\nagents) most preferred to let to people in work; they least preferred to let to the unemployed\nand students. In regard to HB claimants the research found:42\n'Only a small minority of landlords preferred tenants to be on Housing Benefit. The great majority of\nlandlords and agents said that they preferred to let to people who were not receiving Housing Benefit, or had\nno preference either way. Investment-motivated landlords had views on this that were little different from those\nof other types of landlord.\nLandlords and their agents gave a great variety of reasons why they preferred not to let to people on Housing\nBenefit. These were mainly to do with difficulties surrounding the administration of the scheme, such as\ndelays in processing claims and the perceived \"red tape\" and \"hassles\" involved in letting to people on\nHousing Benefit; the undesirable image which some landlords had of benefit recipients; and the financially\ninsecure position of people receiving such payments.'\nThe Government's response to these concerns is as follows:43\n'The noble Earl wants the Government to demonstrate that the supply of shared accommodation is adequate\nbefore this measure is implemented. That cannot be done because the availability of accommodation depends,\nin part, on the demand for it. Any research in this area can only be of limited use because the change we are\nseeking to implement is designed to encourage behavioural changes on the part of both landlord and tenant.\nThere is evidence to show that the private rental market has been able to respond to the demand from students\nfor shared accommodation. We have every confidence that landlords and young people will be able to adapt\nto this change.'\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n42\n JRF, The Supply of Privately Rented Homes, March 1995 pp 10-11 \n43 HL Deb 14 May 1996 c.444\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nThe SSAC's report rejects comparisons with the availability of student accommodation:44\n'The fact that there is shared accommodation available for students is not relevant for other young people.\nSome landlords are willing to let to students but not to people on benefit. Students have fewer problems in\nsharing accommodation temporarily for part of the year. They often have financial support from parents and\ncan return periodically to the parental home. They have a common purpose and shared interests with other\nstudents and the support of college facilities during the day which together make the drawbacks of their\naccommodation less acute.'\nThe Government has rejected calls to base the limit for HB on the average rent for\naccommodation in the locality which provides exclusive use of a kitchen, bathroom and toilet\nfacilities on the ground that this 'would set a standard of accommodation which is higher than\nthat which young working people would expect to have if they chose to live independently.'45\n4. Homelessness\nA widely predicted effect of the restriction of HB for under 25s is an increase in youth\nhomelessness. The SSAC's report comments:46\n'Young people under 25 receive a lower rate of IS - £36.80 a week whereas an over 25 would receive £46.50\n(1995/96 rates) - a shortfall of £9.70 a week. The Department estimates total savings of £65 million from the\nHousing Benefit proposal, which means an average weekly loss per person of £9 a week. This double\ndisadvantage could lead to situations in which young people are harassed by landlords because of rent arrears,\nleading to possible eviction and homelessness.'\nShelter's response to the draft regulations expressed concern over the large number of people\nwho may have experienced a rent restriction as a result of the January 1996 changes who may\nexperience a further reduction on October:\n'Those on income support will find it particularly hard to meet the difference out of their benefit and will\neither attempt to find or move to cheaper accommodation or face eviction and homelessness if arrears build\nup.'\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n44 Cm 3225 p.21 para 38\n45 ibid p.14 para 48\n46 ibid, p.19 para 29\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nIn response to a Parliamentary Question on whether money would be transferred to the DoE\nfrom the DSS to cover costs arising from any increase in youth homelessness as a result of\nHB restrictions the Government said:47\n'There is no evidence to support the contention that the October 1996 housing benefit changes for single\npeople under 25 will result in increased homelessness. No transfer of funds has therefore been made to the\nDepartment of the Environment.'\nThere is particular concern over the fact that under 25s will not benefit from the '50% rule':48\n'The proposal for the new ceiling differs from that for local reference rents introduced in January 1996 in that\nit does not allow for payment of 50% of the difference between the single room rent and the rent officer's\ndetermination of a reasinable rent, which would ensure that HB reflected, at least in part, the genuine market\nrent being charged by the landlord. The fact that this 50% 'top up' was considered appropriate as part of the\nlocal reference rent system but does not feature as part of this proposal appears to us to be inconsistent and\ndiscriminatory against younger adults.'\n5. Hardship payments and specific groups\nA number of respondents to the draft regulations argued for an extension of the groups of\nunder 25s who would be exempted from the changes. The Government accepted these\narguments, with some limitations, in relation to people being resettled on leaving local\nauthority care (up to their 22nd birthday), people who were not entitled to HB when they took\nup their tenancies (restrictions will not apply for the first 13 weeks of a claim) and people\nhoused in registered housing association dwellings.\nThe Government rejected the SSAC's recommendations to exempt the following groups:49\n• people whose claim was made before 7 October 1996;\n• people considered to be vulnerable and in priority need under the homelessness legislation;\n• people who are part of a resettlement programme;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n47 HL Deb 17 April 1996 c.75WA\n48 Cm 3225, p.21 para 36\n49 ibid, pp 12-13 para 46\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\n• pregnant women;\n• people in receipt of disability premium;\n• people deemed incapable of work;\n• people suffering from a medical condition for whom shared accommodation would be\nunsuitable;\n• people for whom the local authority considers shared accomodation would be unsuitable;\n• people living in mobile homes.\nThe ADC has 'little confidence' that the adjustment of current provision for discretionary\npayments to reflect the possibility of claims from under 25s will be sufficient to meet\nanticipated demand.50 The SSAC has repeated its call for the list of exempt vulnerable groups\nwhich existed prior to 2 January 1996 to remain in place and has also suggested that the cash\nlimited hardship fund may not be adequate to deal with the problems that may arise.51\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n50 ADC's response to the draft regulations, para 20\n51 Cm 3225, p.22 para 46\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/67\nRelated Research Papers include:\nHousing\n96/58 Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Bill 01.05.96\n[HL Bill 118 of 1995/96]\n96/12 The social rented sector, conduct of tenants and 25.01.96\nHousing Benefit in the Housing Bill\n[Bill 44 of 1995/96]\n96/11 Houses in multiple occupation, the private rented 23.01.96\nsector and leasehold reform in the Housing Bill\n[Bill 44 of 1995/96]\n96/10 Homelessness and housing allocations in the 23.01.96\nHousing Bill [Bill 44 of 1995/96]\n95/67 Housing Benefit: The Proposed Changes 25.05.95\n22\n\n\n\n"

This paper presents up-to-date\nresidence-based unemployment rates not published elsewhere for all 651 constituencies in the\nUK, using figures for the number of unemployed claimants from the monthly count and data\nfor the economically active population from the 1991 Census of Population. \nLast month the Office for National Statistics moved to a 1991 ward base for the\nunemployment statistics. This means that for many constituencies it is no longer possible to\nmake direct comparisons with previously published data. As a result, this Paper no longer\nincludes a table on changes in the level of unemployment in recent years. Research Paper\n96/63 provides a guide to the methodology and to which constituencies are affected by the\nchange in the geographical base.\nJane Dyson\nEconomic Policy Paul Mann\n& Statistics Section Statistics Resource Unit\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n                                                                   \nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not published elsewhere. These use figures for the number of unemployed\nclaimants from the monthly count and figures for the number of people economically active\nderived from the 1991 Census of Population. \nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour, as they take no account of people's ability to seek work outside the constituency\nin which they live. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nthe Research Paper 96/63.\nThe data contained in this Paper are generally not comparable with figures published in the\nPapers of this series prior to April 1996. This is because the ONS have, last month, changed\nthe geographical basis of the monthly claimant count. Previously, the monthly figures have\nrelated to parliamentary constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1981 wards. From April\n1996 onwards the figures are based on constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1991 wards.\nWhilst figures for January, February and March 1996 were re-released on the new basis, back-\nruns of figures for dates prior to 1996 will not be published. For many constituencies\ntherefore, there will be a discontinuity in the figures at the end of 1995. For this reason it\nis no longer possible to produce tables showing the change in the number of claimants 1 year,\n3 years and 5 years ago. \nNotes to tables:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The\nfollowing abbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\nIND Independent\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/71\n2. The published figures for both unemployed claimants and the economically active\npopulation for Bethnal Green & Stepney and Bow & Poplar are thought to contain an\nerror, due to a ward being misallocated between the two constituencies. Since the\nerror relates to both the numerator and the denominator, the unemployment rates\nshould not be significantly affected. ONS hope to resolve this problem in the near\nfuture.\n3. The published data for unemployed claimants in Belfast North and Belfast West are\nknown to be wrong, due to a technical error in the allocation of claimants to\nconstituencies. In order to provide data for all 651 constituencies we have assumed\nthat claimants are divided between the two in the same proportion as in March. ONS\nhope to resolve this problem in the near future.\n4. The data from the 1991 Census of Population used for the denominators in calculating\nresidence-based unemployment rates were obtained from the dataset known as the\nLocal Base Statistics. In the case of the Censuses for England and Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland, the raw data relate to areas known as \"Enumeration Districts\".\nThese data are first aggregated into electoral wards and then wards are aggregated to\nform constituency totals. In Scotland the raw data relate to \"Output Areas\". These\nfigures are not available at a ward level but are aggregated directly into higher level\ngeographical areas such as constituencies and districts.\nThere is inevitably a time-lag between changes in electoral ward boundaries being\nincorporated into parliamentary constituencies. This means that wards are not always\ncoterminous with constituencies. Where this is the case, wards have been best-fitted\nto constituencies on the basis of the constituency where the majority of the population\nare thought to live.

A greater quality and\nquantity of data on hazards and risks are continuously being assembled as a result of scientific\nresearch.

Recent years have seen\nan agenda dominated by EC directives and a deregulation initiative aimed at simplifying\nand consolidating both primary and secondary legislation. The aims of this paper are\ntwofold: to summarise how the system works and to indicate some of the ways in which\nscience and engineering provide underpinning. The latter ranges from accident\ninvestigation to the compilation of occupational exposure limits for hazardous chemicals. \nHowever, the scope of what may be termed health and safety science extends well beyond\nsuch immediate applications. Long term research needs to anticipate the potential risks\nassociated with emerging technologies, such as genetic modification. In addition, whole\nfields of research such as engineering materials, combustion chemistry, and biomedical\nsciences, are of general significance.\nThe first section of the paper describes the health and safety law in both Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland, and the methods of enforcement. Under section 11(2)(b) of the Health\nand Safety at Work etc. Act, the Health and Safety Commission has a statutory duty to\nmake appropriate arrangements for research. It delegates this responsibility to the Health\nand Safety Executive, a body which was also established by the 1974 Act. The second\nsection of the paper outlines the work performed by the Health and Safety Laboratory, an\nagency of the HSE which is one of the public sector laboratories subject to the\nGovernment's prior options review.\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/75\nI The health and safety system\nA. Legislation\nPrior to the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, which implemented the Robens\nreport1 on health and safety law, legislation in the UK had been industry-specific. One\nexample which comes to mind is the 1802 Act for the preservation of the Health and\nMorals of Apprentices and others employed in Cotton and other Mills, and Cotton and\nother Factories (Geo. 3, cap 73). This limited the working hours of pauper apprentices to\n12 hours a day, as well as providing for other aspects of their welfare. Indeed it is\ndescribed in Redgrave, Fife & Machin: Health and Safety (1993) as the first Act of\nParliament intended to protect the welfare of people at work. \nMore recent examples include the Mines and Quarries Act 1954 and the Offices, Shops\nand Railway Premises Act 1963. The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (cap 37)\nimposed a general duty on \"every employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable,\nthe health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees\". In performing their work,\nboth employers and employees also have general duties under the Act not to compromise\nthe health and safety of members of the public. The Act also established the Health and\nSafety Commission (HSC) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The Commission\nis appointed by the Secretary of State for the Environment (until recently, the Secretary of\nState for Employment had this role) to whom it submits proposals for new regulations. \nThe HSC also prepares approved codes of practice which provide practical guidance as to\nhow the requirements of regulations may be met. A complete list of health and safety\nlegislation has been published by the HSE.2 Enforcement of health and safety provisions\nis the main responsibility of the HSE, appointed by the HSC. \nB. Enforcement\nBreaches of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act, and regulations made under it, are\nsubject to criminal prosecutions either by the Health and Safety Executive or by local\nauthority environmental health officers. An injured party can simultaneously bring a civil\naction for damages by invoking the common law tort of negligence. The 1974 Act does\nnot allow a civil action in respect of a breach of statutory duty, though regulations made\nunder the Act do allow this, unless they expressly state otherwise.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 Report of the Committee on Safety and Health at Work Cmnd 5034 1972\n2 List of Current Health and Safety Legislation HSE 1995\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/75\nEnforcement mechanisms available to HSE and local authority inspectors, other than\ncriminal prosecutions, range from providing advice to the issue of statutory improvement\nor prohibition notices. On serving an improvement notice, the inspector must specify a\ntime period of at least 21 days within which the contravention is to be remedied. Twenty\none days corresponds to the period within which an appeal may be lodged with an\nindustrial tribunal. \nProhibition notices can take effect immediately, and are served only if an inspector thinks\nthere is a risk of serious personal injury. A prohibition notice continues to apply even if\nan appeal has been lodged (unless the tribunal directs to the contrary). \nC. The European dimension\nThe Single European Act 19863 raised the profile of European legislative activity in health\nand safety by inserting Article 118A into the Treaty of Rome. This allowed health and\nsafety directives to be adopted by qualified majority voting, and gave rise initially to the\nso-called \"six pack\" of EC directives. In addition to a framework directive (89/391/EEC)\nthere were five daughter directives covering:\n• the manual handling of loads\n• display screen equipment\n• the workplace\n• the use of work equipment\n• the use of personal protective equipment\nSubsequent daughter directives have also been implemented, and Article 118A is a major\nsource of new law. Perhaps the most significant feature of the new regulations is the\nemphasis placed on performing risk assessments in the workplace. A requirement on\nemployers to perform risk assessments forms part of the Management of Health and Safety\nat Work Regulations SI 1992/2051 which implement the above-mentioned framework\ndirective. The purpose of risk assessments is to help the employer or self-employed\nperson determine the measures which are necessary to comply with duties under health\nand safety legislation.4 Risk assessments place on a more formal and systematic basis the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 implemented into UK law by the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1986 cap 58\n4 Management of Health and Safety at Work. Approved Code of Practice, HSC 1992\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/75\nsteps needed to identify danger and to minimise the associated risk; an activity already\nimplicit in the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. Regulation 7 of the Management of\nHealth and Safety at Work Regulations 1992 requires employers to establish procedures to\nenable employees to escape from serious and imminent danger. Again, this makes more\nexplicit the general duties contained in the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act (particularly\nsection 2).\nSo far as the implementation of health and safety Directives is concerned, the indications\nare that the UK record is, for the most part, relatively good. By way of example, the UK\nwas one of only three countries (the others were Denmark and the Irish Republic) to\nimplement the six pack Directives within 3 months of their implementation date, 1 January\n1993.5\nAn important qualification is that the UK has still not implemented Articles dealing with\nfire safety which were a feature of both the Framework and Workplace Directives. The\ndifficulty has arisen because fire safety in the UK has been treated as being largely\ndistinct from other health and safety issues, with different government departments taking\na lead role in the associated legislation. We shall return briefly to this issue in section\nI(E) below. \nThe UK mounted a legal challenge (rejected in the Opinion of the European Court of\nJustice's Advocate-General6) to the EC Working Time Directive (93/104/EC) which was\nadopted by qualified majority voting under the provisions of Article 118A of the Treaty of\nRome.7 This provides a good example of a mismatch between UK and EC perceptions of\nwhat constitutes a health and safety measure. One argument is that working hours should\nbe a matter to be settled by employer and employee and that Article 118A on health and\nsafety should not be used as an instrument of social policy. On the other hand one could\npoint to a variety of UK statutes which seem to acknowledge the role of working hours in\nhealth and safety, a recent example being regulation 4 of the Railways (Safety Critical\nWork) Regulations SI 1994/299. \nAnother recent development of interest in the EC context is the establishment of the\nEuropean Agency for Safety and Health at Work.8 This was launched in Bilbao, Spain on\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 Croner's Health and Safety Special Report December 1993\n6\n\"UK loses working time challenge\" Health and Safety Bulletin April 1996\n7 For details, see library research paper 94/52, The Working Time Directive.\n8 Council Regulation (EC) No 1643/95, 29 June 1995 - amending Regulation (EC) No 2062/94, 18 July 1994\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/75\n27 October 19959 and the Director was recently\nappointed.10 In addition to encouraging improvements in work place health and safety, the\naim of the Agency will be to provide EC bodies and Member States with relevant\ntechnical, scientific and economic information. The HSE is reported to acknowledge that\nthe Agency could have a major role in helping to ensure consistent application of health\nand safety law throughout the Community.11\nD. Deregulation\nAn important development has been the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 (cap\n40) designed in part to allow the repeal of outmoded health and safety regulations. \nSection 37 allows for the repeal or revocation, without replacement, of health and safety\nmeasures following consultation with the Health and Safety Commission. The origin of the\nmeasures in the Act can most obviously be traced back to a speech by the Prime Minister\nat the Conservative Party Conference in October 1992 when he invited the then President\nof the Board of Trade to address the problems presented by the \"burgeoning maze of\nregulations\".12\n  \nComprehensive reviews were performed by the Health and Safety Commission and seven\nbusiness deregulation task forces, covering different industries, established by the President\nof the Board of Trade. The chairmen of the latter were appointed in March 1993 with a\nremit:\n\"To advise Ministers on priorities for the repeal or simplification of existing\nregulations and enforcement methods so as to minimise the costs on\nbusiness; to advise Ministers on the best way of developing and maintaining\nconsultation on the introduction and enforcement of new regulations\nincluding those arising from EC measures; bearing in mind the\nconsiderations of public health, safety and security which underlie the\nregulatory system.\"\nThe recommendations13 of the business deregulation task forces were published on the\nsame day as the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill. These covered areas as diverse\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n9 European Commission: Europa world wide web server. \ninternet address http://www-mirror.europeonline.com/europa/en/agencies.html\n10 HSE spokesman\n11 Croner Health & Safety Briefing 4 July 1994 p.6\n12 Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill, House of Commons Library Research Paper 94/16\n13 Deregulation. Task Forces Proposals for Reform January 1994\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/75\nas financial services and health and safety.\nIn December 1992 the Department of Employment Minister with responsibility for health\nand safety (Mr Michael Forsyth) asked the Health and Safety Commission to conduct its\nown review of legislation. The Commission responded by establishing seven Task Groups\nof employers and employee representatives, whose subject coverage mirrored that of the\nbusiness deregulation task forces. Examples of industries covered were communications\nand transport, engineering, and construction. The HSC's Review of Health and Safety\nRegulation was produced in May 1994 and summarised in a separate document of the\nsame title.\nApart from removing any unnecessary burdens on industry, the purpose of the deregulation\ninitiative in the health and safety context was to simplify and rationalise the law, a need\nacknowledged by the HSC even before its Review. The complexity of the law is largely a\nconsequence of the historical legacy of industry-specific statutes. According to the former\nMinister of State for Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth) proposals from the HSC have,\nsince 1975, \"led to the replacement of around 350 sets of old-style prescriptive sets of\nregulations with some 100 sets of modern goal-setting ones\".14 The key word in the\npreceding statement is \"replacement\". Section 1(2) of the Health and Safety at Work etc.\nAct (HSWA) specifies that replacement legislation should be \"designed to maintain or\nimprove the standards of health, safety and welfare established by or under\" the existing\nenactments; these appear in schedule 1 of the 1974 Act. There have been widespread\nconcerns that the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 could compromise this\ngeneral principle. The Chairman of the HSC, Mr Frank Davies, has in the past given\nassurances that:15\n\"I cannot conceive that the Commission will recommend anything which\nwill lower health and safety standards overall nor could I believe that the\nGovernment would accept it if we did\"\nThe first application of the powers in the Deregulation and Contracting Act as they apply\nto health and safety (section 37) were the Health and Safety (Repeals and Revocations)\nRegulations SI 1995/3234. The regulations repeal and revoke enactments and instruments\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 HC Deb 17 January 1993 c.427W\n15\n\"HSC to study deregulation bill and deregulation task force recommendations\" Health and Safety Commission\nTask Force 19 January 1994\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/75\nspecified in two schedules; the most controversial repeals relate to home workers. During\na debate in the First Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation (28 November 1995)\nMr Ian McCartney argued against the removal of a link (section 133 of the Factories Act\n1961) between the Health and Safety Executive, local authorities and people who work at\nhome. One survey of 338 home workers found that only 11% had received any health and\nsafety advice, information or training from their work supplier.16 Further revocations have\nbeen proposed in the areas of textile factories and agriculture.\nE. Northern Ireland\nArticle 12 of The Health and Safety at Work (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 17 established\nthe Health and Safety Agency which provides advice to industry and makes\nrecommendations to government departments. Enforcement rests with inspectors\nappointed by the Department of Economic Development, the Department of Agriculture or\nthe District Councils.18 The Northern Ireland Health and Safety Agency approves codes of\npractice aimed at providing practical guidance for satisfying health and safety regulations. \nFor example, during 1993/1994 the Agency approved two Great Britain codes of practice\ndealing with the transportation of hazardous substances, as well as three Northern Ireland\ncodes of practice (two on gas safety and one on first aid).19 \nArticle 13(3) of The Health and Safety at Work (Northern Ireland) Order allows the\nAgency to make appropriate arrangements for carrying out and publishing research. \nRecent research projects which have been commissioned have provided information on\ntraining providers, the cost of work related accidents and ill health, and the health and\nsafety information and advice needs of business. The agency also monitors research work\nperformed by the Health and Safety Executive, some of which is discussed in the section\nof this paper dealing with science and engineering.\nF. Fire safety\nIn the UK fire safety has been treated separately both from the legislative and enforcement\nstandpoints. Policy responsibility lies with the Home Office, the Department of the\nEnvironment and the HSE. Given the complex and fragmentary nature of fire law20, it is a\ngross but useful simplification to say that the main legal instruments which concern the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n16\n\"Working at home: out of sight, out of mind\" Health and Safety Bulletin June 1996 p.4\n17 SI 1978/1039 (N.I. 9)\n18 The Legal Framework of Health and Safety at work in Northern Ireland Health and Safety Agency 1995\n19 Annual Report. Statement of Accounts 1 April 1994 to 31 March 1995 Health and Safety Agency\n20\n\"Shaping the future of fire law\" by Dr Ann Rosemarie Everton, in Fire Safety Legislation (School of Business\nand Industrial Management conference, 21 February 1996)\n12\n\n\nthree above bodies are, respectively, the Fire Precautions Act 1971, the Building Regulations\n1991, and the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. This is in line with enforcement\nresponsibilities: fire authorities issue fire certificates for designated premises in line with the\nprovisions of the 1971 Act. Local authorities oversee the building control process based on\nthe Building Regulations 1991 and the associated Approved Documents, one of which is\ndevoted to preventing the establishment and spread of fire. Finally, the general requirements\nof the 1974 Act imply the need to take fire precautions, though in practice the HSE confines\nits enforcement to industrial processes which present fire risks.\nAll the above aspects of fire law have been under review with the aim of achieving a\nrationalisation and simplification, and draft proposals for Workplace (Fire Precautions)\nRegulations have been issued for consultation.21 Under the proposals, fire safety would\ncontinue to be treated separately and enforceable in the main by fire authorities. The aim of\nthe new regulations would be to implement (late) the Articles dealing with fire safety which\nwere a feature of both the so-called \"Framework\" and \"Workplace\" health and safety\nDirectives discussed in section I(C) above.22 The delay has been due in part to the\nwithdrawal of two earlier sets of proposals on the grounds that they placed an unnecessary\nburden on business.23\n                                                                                                                                                 \n     \n21 Proposals for Workplace (Fire Precautions) Regulations.

Home Office, deposited\npaper 3400(3S) 21 May 1996\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/75\nII Science and engineering\nA. Science-based legislation\nThough the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act is clearly the mainstay of the British safety\nsystem, the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations SI 1994/3246\nundoubtedly represent one of the more important pieces of secondary legislation. Indeed,\nRobens attributed the levelling off of workplace fatalities towards the end of the sixties as\npartly being due to \"the rapid increase in the number of new chemical substances and\nmixtures being brought into use in industrial and commercial processes and the greatly\nincreased scale on which they are used.\"24 The so-called COSHH regulations, and the\nassociated approved codes of practice25, are intended to provide a general prescription for\nprotecting workers from a wide range of chemical and biological agents. The regulations\ninclude duties in respect of risk assessment, prevention or control of exposure, and the\nmaintenance of control measures, the last line of defence being the issue of personal\nprotective equipment. They consolidate the original 1988 regulations.26 Substances which\nare covered by separate regulations include asbestos, lead, ionising radiations and highly\nflammable liquids.27 There have recently been suggestions that regulations controlling lead\nand asbestos could be incorporated into the COSHH system, but this option would be at\nthe expense of complicating the latter, while the asbestos and lead industries have plenty\nof experience in dealing with the more prescriptive regulations applying to them.28\nA key feature of the COSHH regulations are the maximum exposure levels for individual\nsubstances which form part of the regulations themselves. By way of example, the long-\nterm exposure limit for exposure to arsenic is 0.1 milligrams per cubic metre of air.29 \nThis represents the maximum permissible airborne concentration to which a worker may\nbe continuously exposed over an eight hour shift.30 The formal definition of maximum\nexposure limit is flexible enough to take into account a variety of different exposure levels\nduring the course of the working day.31 If it is reasonably practicable for an employer to\nreduce the exposure level further, he is under a statutory obligation to do so.32\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n24 cited in Valedictory Summary of Industrial Health and Safety since the 1974 Act John Rimington (Director\nGeneral, Health and Safety Executive) 26 April 1995\n25 Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1994.

EH40/96 HSE\n32 Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1994, Regulation 7(6)\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/75\nA second type of occupational exposure limit is called an occupational exposure standard,\ndetails of which are published and updated annually by the HSE.33 These apply to\nsubstances where certain levels of exposure can, on the available evidence, be safely\ntolerated indefinitely. The airborne concentration of such a substance needs to be reduced\nto its occupational exposure standard as soon as is reasonably practicable,34 a phrase which\ncrops up frequently in health and safety law. As noted in Occupational Exposure Limits\n1996 (EH40/96 HSE), occupational exposure standards and maximum exposure limits are\nset on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Toxic Substances. The\ncommittee's recommendations are based on an assessment by the Working Group on the\nAssessment of Toxic Chemicals (WATCH) of relevant toxicological, epidemiological and\nother data.\nOver recent years there have been major advances in the techniques of genetic\nmodification, popularly called genetic engineering. Genetic modification involves altering\nan organism's DNA35 so as to change its characteristics. A good deal of background may\nbe found in three library research papers: Genetically Modified Organisms, Transgenic\nAnimals and Animal Patenting, Research Paper 93/55; Gene Therapy, Research Paper\n93/66; Genetically Modified Food, Research Paper 94/74.\nGenetically-modified organisms (GMOs) are now used, for example, to manufacture\nmedicinal products such as insulin, blood factor VIII and human growth hormone which\nhad previously been produced from humans or animals with an attendant risk of\ntransmitting disease. Like any technology, genetic modification has certain risks and\nregulations have been drawn up in response to these. The risks include the possibility that\nsome infectious or drug-resistant micro-organisms might be produced inadvertently, or that\ngenetically engineered features that may be desirable for one organism could be\ntransferred to another. An example of the latter could be the inadvertent transfer of\ngenetic material imparting herbicide resistance from a crop to a weed.\nThe Health and Safety Commission's Advisory Committee on Genetic Modification has\nrecently published a report36 which summarises the current controls. In the context of\ngenetic modification these comprise regulations governing the contained use and the\nrelease and marketing of GMOs. The Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use)\nRegulations SI 1992/3217 (as amended) were made under the Health and Safety at Work\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n33 Occupational Exposure Limits 1996.

The regulations constitute the UK implementation\nof Council Directive 90/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically modified micro-\norganisms. \nThe Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations SI 1992/3280, made\nunder the Environmental Protection Act 1990, implement Council Directive 90/220/EEC. \nAmendments were introduced by the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release)\nRegulations SI 1995/304 in response to Commission Directive 94/15/EC and Commission\nDecision 94/730/EC. The regulations require that, before a GMO is released into the\nenvironment, a dossier of information about the organism and its effects must be\nsubmitted to the Secretary of State and his consent given. The Genetically Modified\nOrganisms (Contained Use) Regulations SI 1993/15 were made, unlike the 1992\nregulations of the same name, under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. They\ndetermine which organisms are subject to the risk assessments required by the 1990 Act\nbefore they may be imported, acquired, released or marketed.\nThis section has provided two examples of ways in which science impinges on health and\nsafety legislation: hazardous substance control and the new technology of genetic\nmodification. Further EC directives are under negotiation in both these areas, in response\nto developments in knowledge and technology. Domestic regulations are also being\nintroduced or planned in response to privatisation and market liberalisation; examples\ninclude the Mines (Special Hazards) Regulations, the Gas Safety (Management)\nRegulations and the Railway Safety Miscellaneous Provisions Regulations.37\nB. Research laboratories\nA large number of laboratories and organisations perform scientific research of relevance\nto health and safety. In addition to university departments and industrial laboratories,\nobvious examples from the public sector include the Building Research Establishment. \nThe BRE, which includes the Fire Research Station, is an executive agency of the\nDepartment of the Environment.38 Work performed by the Fire Research Station ranges\nfrom full-scale experimental fire tests, as well as computer modelling, aimed at\nunderstanding the variety of factors (such as the building materials used) which influence\nthe spread of fire. Monitoring of evacuation exercises and human behaviour in these\nsituations has also been undertaken. This work is of direct relevance to Approved\nDocument B published to provide practical guidance on compliance with the fire safety\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n37 Plan of Work for 1996/97 HSC 1996\n38 Building Research Establishment.

Building Regulations Approved Documents also\nrefer to British Standards, reports and other guidance; a fire safety engineering code in the\nform of a British Standard will eventually be one tangible result of recent BRE work.39 \nFurther information on the Building Research Establishment and government plans to\nmove it into the private sector appear in Prior options review of public sector research\nestablishments (House of Commons Library Research Paper 96/69, 10 June 1996). This\npaper also provides a list of other public sector research establishments which have been\nreviewed in order to assess their suitability for privatisation. Among the examples with an\nobvious health and safety angle are the Medical Research Council's Toxicology Unit and\nthe National Radiological Protection Board established by the Radiological Protection Act\n1970.\nThe outcome of the prior options review in relation to the Health and Safety Laboratory,\nwhich was due to be completed by March 199640, is currently with Ministers.41 Formerly\nthe Research and Laboratory Services Division of the Health and Safety Executive, this\nwas given its present name in 1994 and became an Agency of the HSE on 1 April 1995.42 \nThe aims and objectives of the Health and Safety Laboratory are set out in its Framework\nDocument (HSL, April 1995):\n2.1 The Health and Safety Executive has a mission to ensure that risks to\npeople's health and safety from work activities are properly controlled. It\nrequires a reliable source of research, scientific services and intelligence to\nsupport this mission, and HSL's primary aim is to be a first choice supplier\nof such requirements.\n2.2 HSL, as a laboratory-based centre of scientific excellence, will continue\nto be an authoritative generator and supplier of scientific intelligence in the\nareas of technology in which the Health and Safety Executive has long term\ninterests.\n2.3 HSL will also provide scientific services and advice connected with\nhealth and safety to other organisations.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n39\n\"Part B of the Building Regulations: The Need for Change\" lecture delivered by Anthony Ferguson (Building\nRegulations Division, Department of the Environment) at a conference on Fire Safety Legislation organised\nby the School of Business and Industrial Management, 21 February 1996\n40 HC Deb 23 November 1995 c.238W\n41 source: Department of the Environment spokeswoman\n42 Health & Safety Laboratory.

Most of this research is contracted out\nbut having the \"in-house\" HSL will contribute to the Executive's ability to assess, interpret\nand direct the science which underpins much of its work. By delegating these functions to\nthe HSE, the Health and Safety Commission aims to satisfy its statutory duty, under\nsection 11(2)(b) of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act, to make appropriate\narrangements for health and safety related research.\nThe HSL has two sites: at Sheffield and Buxton, Derbyshire.45 Work is organised into an\nInternal Services Group, a Corporate Support Group, and six Science Groups: Process\nHazards, Explosion Control, Engineering Control, Biomedical Sciences, Workplace\nControl and Environmental Measurement. The laboratory's facilities are available to UK\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n43 Health & Safety Laboratory.

Much of HSL's\nwork is concerned with supporting HSE investigations of accidents, for example through\nthe provision of forensic services. HSL contributed to the investigations which followed\nthe Kings Cross underground fire, the Hillsborough football stadium disaster, and a range\nof fairground accidents among others. On one occasion, the HSE reconstructed a large\nscaffolding structure in order to determine the reasons for the collapse of the original.46 \nRoutine monitoring work, such as measuring radiation levels near nuclear plants, is also\nperformed. Some case studies describing longer term research are described in the next\nsection. During 1996/97, the HSL completed 72 projects and had 120 papers approved for\npublication in the scientific literature.47\n                  \nC. Case studies\nThree years ago, the HSE organised a conference entitled \"Science and the Advancement\nof Industrial Health and Safety, which took place during the British Association's Annual\nFestival of Science.48 The conference included presentations entitled \"Driving for better\ndriver vision\", \"You can't trust dust\" and \"Bugs in the system\". Below, each of these case\nstudies is described in turn, drawing directly from the summaries produced at the\nconference.\nRestrictions on a driver's field of vision have clear implications for road safety.49 What\nthe driver is able to see is determined both by the vehicle design and the environment in\nwhich it operates. One specific example related to a fatal accident which involved an\nunderground mining vehicle where confined space and poor illumination were contributing\nfactors. Following the accident investigation, the HSE constructed a three dimensional\ncomputer model of the vehicle, and a range of drivers differing in physique. The\ncomputer could simulate the view that any driver would have while in the vehicle,\nidentifying blind spots. As a result of this work, which involved cooperation with the\nvehicle manufacturers, drivers and the mines inspectorate, design changes to the vehicle\nwere recommended.\nCollaborative work involving industry, the Institution of Chemical Engineers and the HSE\nhas included studies of dust explosions.50 Coal dust, flour, icing sugar and custard powder\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n46\n\"Science and the Advancement of Industrial Health and Safety\" John Mason Conference, 3 September\n1993\n47 Plan of Work for 1996/97 HSC 1996\n48\n\"Science and the Advancement of Industrial Health and Safety\" John Mason Conference, 3 September 1993\n49\n\"Driving for better driver vision\" Dr Mark Boocock, John Mason Conference HSE 3 September 1993\n50\n\"You can't trust dust\" Dr Geoff Lunn, John Mason Conference HSE 3 September 1993\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/75\nare just four examples of dusts which can explode given the formation of a suitable cloud\nand a source of ignition. If measures to remove these risks fail, then the next link in the\ndefensive chain will involve containing, suppressing or venting an explosion so that its\ndestructive energy is channelled harmlessly. There are severe limitations on the extent to\nwhich a dust explosion can be simulated on a computer, particularly in the context of the\ncontours of a real-world factory. For this reason, it is often necessary to perform actual\nexperiments as a prelude to formulating safety guidelines.\nMicro-organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, some fungi and parasites, are covered by the\nControl of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations SI 1994/3246. The workplace\nrisk associated with a given micro-organism will depend on its virulence and the scale of\nexposure.51 Since there is little information on the levels of exposure in typical workplace\nenvironments, or of the exposure levels which pose a risk to health, a number of studies\nhave been performed which use a variety of techniques to measure exposure. \nFurthermore, the ability of biological organisms to reproduce and infect at very small\ndoses complicates the picture, and there are currently no set occupational exposure limits\nfor any of these. In some cases this means that exposure should be reduced to any level\nlarge enough to be detected.52\nA good indication of future research priorities in science with workplace safety\napplications may be obtained from the Health and Safety Commission's Plan of Work for\n1996/97. The HSE and HSC together plan to spend about £25 million on research during\nthis financial year; research which will be carried out by a range of contractors including\nthe Health and Safety Laboratory, in several cases involving collaboration with industry,\nother government departments and the European Union. One project will look at how the\nmaterial properties of the graphite present in some nuclear reactors change as a result of\nirradiation. This has implications when one comes to decommission the reactor at the end\nof its operating life. How compressed air environments, such as in tunnels, affect the\nspread of fire is another planned project, as is the computer simulation of underground\nfires. A range of research projects aim to assess the impact of interventions, whether\nthese take the form of regulations or campaigns. In this category will be included\nevaluations of the Manual Handling Regulations SI 1992/2793 and the recent Asbestos\nAwareness campaign. Tests are to be performed on mining explosives and on smoke\ncontrol systems in underground rail networks. Other projects relate to below-ground dust,\nhand-arm vibration, safety in the glass industry and work-related stress.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n51\n\"Bugs in the system\" Dr Brian Crook, John Mason Conference HSE 3 September 1993\n52 Control of Biological Agents.

The main growth in terms of value of imports has come from the EU\n(mainly from France), Other Western Europe and Rest of the World. \n* Volume of Trade (excluding oil and erratics) - In the three months to April 1996, the volume of\nexports rose 3 per cent and imports rose 4 per cent compared with the previous three months. Latest\nestimates of trends show both export and import volumes rising. In 1995 as a whole the volume of\nexports (including oil and erratics) rose by 6¼% whereas the volume of imports rose by 3½% compared\nwith 1994. \n* Trade in oil - The surplus on trade in oil in the three months ended April 1996 was £1.1 billion\ncompared with £1.2 billion in the previous three months. \n* Non-EC countries - The non-EU visible trade deficit in May was provisionally estimated at £0.8 billion.\nProvisional estimates of volume (excluding oil and erratics) show exports up 1½ per cent while imports\nwere little changed compared with the previous month.

This paper presents up-to-date\nresidence-based unemployment rates not published elsewhere for all 651 constituencies in the\nUK, using figures for the number of unemployed claimants from the monthly count and data\nfor the economically active population from the 1991 Census of Population. \nIn May 1996 the Office for National Statistics moved to a 1991 ward base for the\nunemployment statistics. This means that for many constituencies it is no longer possible to\nmake direct comparisons with previously published data. As a result, this Paper no longer\nincludes a table on changes in the level of unemployment in recent years. Research Paper\n96/63 provides a guide to the methodology and to which constituencies are affected by the\nchange in the geographical base.\nJane Dyson Paul Mann\nEconomic Policy Alison Penman\n& Statistics Section Statistics Resource Unit\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n                                                                   \nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not published elsewhere. These use figures for the number of unemployed\nclaimants from the monthly count and figures for the number of people economically active\nderived from the 1991 Census of Population. \nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour, as they take no account of people's ability to seek work outside the constituency\nin which they live. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nthe Research Paper 96/63.\nThe data contained in this Paper are generally not comparable with figures published in this\nseries of Papers of this series prior to May 1996. This is because in May 1996 the ONS\nchanged the geographical basis of the monthly claimant count. Previously, the monthly\nfigures have related to parliamentary constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1981 wards.\nFrom the April 1996 figures onwards, data are based on constituencies defined in terms of\nfrozen 1991 wards. Whilst figures for January, February and March 1996 were re-released\non the new basis, back-runs of figures for dates prior to 1996 will not be published. For\nmany constituencies therefore, there will be a discontinuity in the figures at the end of 1995.\nFor this reason it is no longer possible to produce tables showing the change in the number\nof claimants 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ago. \nNotes to tables:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The\nfollowing abbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\nIND Independent\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/81\n2. The data from the 1991 Census of Population used for the denominators in calculating\nresidence-based unemployment rates were obtained from the dataset known as the\nLocal Base Statistics. In the case of the Censuses for England and Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland, the raw data relate to areas known as \"Enumeration Districts\".\nThese data are first aggregated into electoral wards and then wards are aggregated to\nform constituency totals. In Scotland the raw data relate to \"Output Areas\". These\nfigures are not available at a ward level but are aggregated directly into higher level\ngeographical areas such as constituencies and districts.\nThere is inevitably a time-lag between changes in electoral ward boundaries being\nincorporated into parliamentary constituencies. This means that wards are not always\ncoterminous with constituencies. Where this is the case, wards have been best-fitted\nto constituencies on the basis of the constituency where the majority of the population\nare thought to live.

Calder Hall in\nCumbria was the first industrial scale nuclear power station in the world. It was\ncommissioned by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) in 1956 and was\nthe initial member of a family of gas-cooled Magnox reactors named after the magnesium\nalloy used to make the fuel cans which contain the uranium fuel elements. The forerunners\nof these reactors had been designed for military purposes and as the programme of Magnox-\ntype reactors proceeded for commercial energy use it became clear that their engineering and\neconomic limitations were so great that a new reactor design was required. In total eleven\nMagnox stations were built, eight are still operational and three - at Berkeley, Trawsfynydd\nand Hunterston A - are currently being decommissioned. The remaining Magnoxes are\ncoming to the end of their operating life and are unlikely to be kept running much beyond\nthe early part of the next century. Although problems with corrosion of reactor parts have\nled to a reduction in operating temperatures, and therefore a lowered efficiency, overall the\nMagnox reactors have performed well.\nSince 1 April 1996 six Magnox stations at Bradwell, Oldbury, Wylfa, Hinkley Point A,\nDungeness A and Sizewell A have been run under the auspices of Magnox Electric plc (the\ntwo plants at Calder Hall and Chapelcross are operated by British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL)).\nIt has been recognised for some time that it would not be practicable to privatise the Magnox\nstations mainly because they will not generate enough cash over their remaining lifetimes to\nmeet their liabilities for spent fuel reprocessing, disposal of nuclear waste and\ndecommissioning when closed. The Government's plan is to keep these stations running for\nas long as is safely possible. This makes economic sense because their generation costs are\nlow and it defers expenditure on decommissioning1. The eventual aim is to integrate Magnox\nElectric with BNFL which would then run all Magnox stations. The Government's\nobjectives for Magnox Electric were stated in an answer to a recent written parliamentary\nquestion.2:\nMr. Eggar: Yes. The Government wish Magnox Electric plc to be a robust public sector\nentity which will enhance competition in the electricity market and secure the best possible\nvalue for the tax payer from its operations. The company must operate in a commercial\nmanner, judging any investment by commercial rates of return. In doing so, it must:\n1. demonstrate in all its activities that safety is at the foundation of its business;\n2. have full regard to the environmental impact of all its operations;\n3. maximise net revenue from electricity sales by operating its generating plant as fully,\nand for as long, as is consistent with safety requirements;\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n1The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK: Conclusions of the Government's Nuclear Review Department\nof Trade and Industry and the Scottish Office Cm 2860 May 1995\n2HC Deb 10 June 1996 c14w\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 95/83\n4. meet all its nuclear liabilities as cost effectively as possible;\n5. maintain and develop its core skills and capabilities to meet its current and future\noperational needs. Magnox may exploit these skills and capabilities in appropriate\nnew business areas, as agreed with the Government; and\n6. seek a basis for integration with the British Nuclear Fuels which will provide the\ncombined company with a clear incentive to maximise the net revenues from Magnox\ngeneration and to minimise all Magnox-related reprocessing and other back end costs.\nThe second generation of UK nuclear reactors that superseded the Magnox stations were the\nAdvanced Gas Cooled Reactors (AGRs). The principle difference between AGRs and\nMagnox reactors is that the former are more efficient at converting heat generated by nuclear\nfission into electricity by virtue of their much higher core operating temperature. (Both are\ngas-cooled reactors the cooling being accomplished by means of carbon dioxide gas.) To\nchoose the type of reactor to follow the Magnox stations a competition was held to decide\nwhether the British designed AGR or an American design would be most suitable. In 1965\nthe choice was announced. The success of the British designed AGR over its American\ncompetitor was heralded as a triumph for British nuclear technology. These stations\nappeared to have great advantages over the Magnox design and it was hoped that they would\nprovide a competitive alternative to the Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) which was popular\nelsewhere. The use of a pre-stressed concrete pressure vessels for AGRs brought fewer\nworries than those associated with the PWR reactor pressure vessels which were of steel. \n               \nIn the event the AGR building programme turned into a disaster3 for the British nuclear\nindustry. The bankruptcy of contractors followed design changes and construction problems.\nThe completion of stations was often behind schedule4,5. By 1980 only two of the ordered\nstations had been completed. These were at Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B. The\nproblems of Dungeness B became legendary-begun in 1966 and scheduled for completion in\n1970, it was not fully operational by 1990. In retrospect the construction programme was\nhopelessly mismanaged through the aim of keeping several construction consortia in business\nand also by changing designs between each AGR. In all seven AGR stations were\ncommissioned between 1976 and 1988 at Heysham 1 and 2, Hartlepool, Hinkley Point B,\nDungeness B, Hunterston B and Torness. Since 1 April 1996 these stations have been\noperated by British Energy plc. Historically many of the AGRs have had a poor performance\nrecord6. Comparing their performance with that of five years ago, however, their output has\nimproved by around 50% due to several factors7 including: \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n3The Energy Question Gerald Foley\n4ibid\n5Nuclear Power:Its Development in the UK  R F Pocock\n6Nuclear Engineering International July 1996 p34\n7The British Energy Share Offer: Offer Brochure June 1996\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 95/83\ninvestment in developing refuelling plant and enhancing fuel efficiency leading to a reduction\nin down time for refuelling;\nshut down for statutory inspection and maintenance - the average length of these statutory\noutages has been reduced and the periods between them increased at some stations; and\nimproved procedures, increased operator training and investment in more advanced reactor\ncontrol systems.\nIn addition to the AGR stations British Energy also operates the only member of an aborted\nthird generation of nuclear stations, the PWR at Sizewell B in Suffolk. The PWR is the\nmost popular operating reactor worldwide, comprising about two-thirds of the total. It is\nof a totally different design from the Magnox and AGR stations making use of water under\nvery high pressure both as a coolant to transfer energy to the electricity generating plant\n(turbine), and as a moderator to slow down neutrons to aid nuclear fission. Sizewell B was\ncompleted in 1994 and began to supply electricity to the grid on 14 February 1995. Further\ninformation about UK reactor design is contained in Library Research Paper 94/31 The\nNuclear Review.\nIt is British Energy, comprising the eight most modern UK stations (7 AGRs plus 1 PWR)\nthat the government is about to privatise. A map showing the geographical location of UK\ncommercial nuclear power stations and principal UKAEA and BNFL sites is reproduce\nbelow8.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n8The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK: Conclusions of the Government's Nuclear Review Department\nof Trade and Industry and the Scottish Office Cmnd 2860 May 1995\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 95/83\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 95/83\nII Decommissioning\nDecommissioning of nuclear power stations should be considered in two parts. First the\nphysical decommissioning strategy and second the means to pay for it. These will be\ndiscussed in turn.\nA. Decommissioning Strategy\nDecommissioning strategy for nuclear power stations in the UK currently comprises three\nstages9:\n(i) Immediately after shutdown the reactor is defuelled;\n(ii) After 5-10 years the buildings external to the reactor shield are removed;\n(iii) 100 years after shutdown the reactor is demolished.\nAs an alternative the gas-cooled reactors could be decommissioned using a \"safestore\"\nmethod. This would be identical to the above strategy at point (i) but diverge in points (ii)\nand (iii) as follows\n(iib) After 5-10 years non-radioactive buildings are removed and radioactive\nbuildings are prepared for an extended period of care and maintenance. Thirty\nyears after shutdown, the existing buildings are placed in \"safestore\" by sealing\nopenings such as doors and covering walls with high integrity materials. The\naim is that no further maintenance should be required over a period of a\nfurther 100 years although routine surveillance would be carried out throughout\nthe period.\n(iiib) At the end of the safestore period of about 135 years after shutdown all the\nbuildings and the reactor are demolished.\nA variation on safestore would be to proceed to it immediately after shutdown instead of 30\nyears later.\nThere are arguments both for and against safestore. It would allow more time for radioactive\ndecay and further advances in technology. It is also more cost-effective and would enhance\nthe UK's position in advising and assisting with decommissioning in other countries. Those\nagainst safestore argue that stations should be decommissioned as soon as possible to be in\nline with the concept of sustainable development, and that plant decommissioned early does\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n9Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy:Final Conclusions Cm 2919\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 95/83\nnot have time to deteriorate. In addition if decommissioning is carried out soon after\nshutdown the knowledge and experience of those who worked on the site during its\noperational life are still available.\nThe use of safestore has recently become topical with regard to Trawsfynydd station which\nis one of three Magnox stations currently being decommissioned. It is reported10,11 that an\napplication for planning permission to safestore the plant will be made later this year and that\nit has been delayed so as not to upset the sale of British Energy.\nThe Government intends to require all nuclear operators to prepare strategies for\ndecommissioning of their stations on a case-by-case basis12. These will include justification\nof proposed timetables and financial provisions. Such plans will be reviewed quinquennially\nby the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in consultation with the environment agencies13\nto ensure that they remain soundly based. \nB. Nuclear Liabilities and the Segregated Fund\nThe transfer of AGR and Sizewell B liabilities to British Energy was one of the main issues\nstudied by the Trade and Industry Select Committee (TISC) which reported on 14 February\n199614. It was recognised in their report that \n26. The unique feature of the economics of nuclear power is the nuclear liabilities - for the\nreprocessing of spent fuel, the management and disposal of radioactive waste and the\ndecommissioning of stations. They are unique because of their vast size, dominating the\nbalance sheet, the significant element of uncertainty about some of them and the fact that some\nof them will not fall due for a century or more, long after the existing stations have closed.\nWith this in mind the report recommended that \"whatever the level of liabilities, the liabilities\nshould follow the assets from which they arose\" (para 67). The Government has repeated\nits commitment to this on numerous occasions. Most recently in the Opposition debate about\nnuclear privatisation15 the Minister for Industry and Energy, Mr Tim Eggar MP, said:\nI must repeat again that liabilities have followed assets in the proposals for the sale of British\nEnergy. We have made it clear in the past that that will happen, and I repeat quite\ncategorically and unreservedly that liabilities will follow assets and that British Energy is\nresponsible and will remain responsible for the liabilities that are associated with its stations.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n10Western Daily Mail 11 June 1996 p1 \n11Financial Times 10 June 1996 p7\n12Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy:Final Conclusions Cm 2919\n13The Environmental Agency in England and Scotland,the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency in Scotland.\n14Nuclear Privatisation Trade and Industry Select Committee HC 43 1995/6\n15HC Deb 18 June 1996 c 742-786\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 95/83\nThe TISC16 also recommended (paragraph 55) \"The government should establish more\nreliable arrangements to ensure that long-term liabilities arising after stations close are\ndischarged\", and with regard to the Segregated Fund to meet the liabilities (Paragraph 56)\n\"The Government should establish the Segregated Fund and appoint its trustees as soon as\npossible\".\nMr Eggar announced17 on 27 February 1996 that the Segregated Fund would be established\non 31 March 1996 and come into effect on privatisation. The Fund is intended to cover the\npost-closure costs of decommissioning British Energy's nuclear power stations and their sites,\nexcluding the cost of defuelling, and two other major long-term liabilities: the management\nand disposal of spent waste off site; and British Energy's share of BNFL decommissioning.\nIt will be managed by an independent trust known as the Nuclear Trust18. At the official\nopening of Sizewell B on 25 March 1996 Mr Ian Lang MP, the President of the Board\nTrade, announced19 that the Fund would receive \"an initial endowment of about £230 million\nfrom British Energy and they will pay about £16 million a year initially\". The source of\nthese funds from a company in the public sector and their apparent insufficiency have been\nthe subject of much debate and speculation. Margaret Beckett, MP, raised these issues\nrecently in the Opposition debate about nuclear privatisation:\nTo begin with, there is obscurity about the issue of the segregated fund itself. The last Red\nBook shows a cost to the Exchequer in respect of the industry of some £230 million -\nprecisely the sum that has appeared on the balance sheet of British Energy, and will be the\ndowry it provides to start off the fund.\nIt is presumably on the basis of the scale of the dowry from public funds that the level of\nyearly contribution from the privatised company is assessed at a mere £16 million a year,\ncompared to previous estimates from City analysts that funding would have to be about £30\nmillion to £50 million a year - more than double, at the very least. I say \"presumably\",\nbecause the Government have, up to now, failed to publish or place in the Library of the\nHouse the report that they claim provides the justification for such a low contribution, on the\nspurious grounds that it is not yet completed. However, that does not seem to have prevented\nthe Government from reaching a judgment on the report.\nEnvironmental groups have also expressed dissent. An example of these are the views of the\nConsortium of Opposing Local Authorities ( COLA) and Friends of the Earth (FOE). They\nhave set out their concerns about liabilities that will be exempt from the Segregated Fund,\nand the adequacy of the Fund given their claim that a 3.5% real annual growth rate up to the\nyear 2130 has been asssumed when a 2% rate might be more prudent20:\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n16Nuclear Privatisation Trade and Industry Select Committee HC 43 1995/6\n17DTI Press Notice P/96/147\n18DTI Press Notice P/95/845\n19DTI Press Notice P/96/240\n20Privatisation: The Liability Burden on the Public Sector Special Briefing  No 23 COLA June 1996 \n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 95/83\nHowever, despite Government assurances, two possible types of AGR liability exemption\nemerged during evidence to TISC:\n'operational' exemptions - primarily concerned with the reprocessing of spent AGR fuel already\ndelivered to BNFL, stored at station sites, or currently in reactor cores; and\n'post-shutdown' exemptions - liabilities which will not be paid for by the BE segregated fund\nbecause the level of contributions has been set far too low.\nWith regard to 'operational' exemptions, the total of pre- 1996 AGR reprocessing liabilities (as\ndefined above) was estimated to TISC at an undiscounted £4 billion. There has subsequently\nbeen a debate about how much of this total BE might be exempted from18. The new\nCOLA/FOE research takes the debate forward significantly by developing a method for\nestimating likely 'operational' exemptions in the years 1996-2005. It does this by comparing\npublic statements of planned fuel cycle payments to BNFL, with estimates derived from\npublished front and back end fuel cycle costs. The results are disturbing: it appears that the\nlikely 'operational' exemption is a minimum of £1.7 billion19.\nWith regard to 'post-shutdown' exemptions, the previous briefing outlined the results of\nresearch on the required and proposed levels of annual payments by BE into a segregated fund\n20\n. It showed that at the proposed level of £16 million a year there is very little reassurance\nfor the taxpayer that several categories of long-term AGR liability will be met. These 'post-\nshutdown' exemptions include four liability categories: AGR final core reprocessing; AGR\nstage I decommissioning; AGR intermediate and high level waste disposal; and the\ndecommissioning of AGR-related facilities at Sellafield. They total £3.6 billion.\nIn addition, there is potential for the BE segregated fund to default further liabilities, because\nfund performance might be less than has been assumed (3.5% real annual growth to 2130).\nIf a more prudent assumption of 2% is made beyond 30 years, the BE segregated fund would\nfail in 2117, leaving £1.6 billion of decommissioning costs to fall to the public sector.\nAlthough less certain than the first two exemptions, this represents a real further risk to the\ntaxpayer.\n18D Lascelles, 'British Energy Landed with £1 bn Bill', Financial Times, 2 March 1996.\n19M J Sadnicki, 'Nuclear Privatisation: Liabilities left in the State Sector', June 1996, p17-18\n20COLA, 'British Energy Segregated Fund: the Inadequacy Exposed', Special Briefing No 22,\nApril 1996.\nThe \"new COLA and FOE commissioned research\" by Mike Sadnicki mentioned in the text\nwhich amplifies concerns about the level of provision for the Segregated Fund has led to an\nongoing public disagreement with the Government.21,22\nInformation about financial strategies to meet nuclear liabilities in other countries is presented\nin Section IV.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n21HC Deb 19 June 1996 c 868\n22Guardian  25 June 1996 p19\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 95/83\nIII Spent Fuel Management \nBoth during the operation of a nuclear power station and at decommissioning the spent fuel\nis the most radiologically hazardous material to be dealt with. The Segregated Fund does not\ncover the defuelling cost of AGRs and the PWR23 . \nA. Strategy\nSpent fuel from AGRs and PWR reactors can either be reprocessed soon after removal to\nextract uranium and plutonium for reuse or held in storage at a dry store for direct disposal\nor reprocessing at a later date. The Government's view is that the method chosen should be\na matter of commercial judgement for the owner as long as regulatory requirements are met24.\nB. Siting of Dry Stores\nScottish Nuclear Ltd (SNL) originally planned to build a dry store as an alternative to\nreprocessing spent fuel at Torness in East Lothian. At a public enquiry into the proposals\nit was recommended that the Government should consider the need for a national strategy on\nthe siting of dry stores. \nThe options are:\n* a single-store strategy with one or more stores at a single site or \n* a multi-store strategy with one or more stores at a number of sites.\nA Government appraisal of these alternatives, particularly with regard to safety, concluded\nthat there were no obvious benefits to either strategy. Decisions about the type and siting\nof dry stores will be matters for the commercial judgement of operators taking into account\nthe necessary planning and regulatory requirements. Given the public dissent over the NIREX\nproposal for the siting of a Rock Characterisation Facility for low and intermediate- level\nradioactive waste near Sellafield in Cumbria the siting of dry stores could run into\nconsiderable problems. \nSNL's plan to build a dry store at Torness has been abandoned following more recent\nreprocessing contracts with BNFL25, but the issue may arise in the future.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n23HC Deb 22 May 1996 c 535w\n24Review of Radioactive Waste Managemfent Policy:Final Conclusions Cm2919\n25Financial Times 'Long-standing nuclear foes kiss and make up' 7 March 1995\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 95/83\nIV Financial arrangements in other countries\nIn other countries nuclear liabilities are essentially funded in one of two ways, although the\ndetails are many and varied. In some countries it has been considered unnecessary for there\nto be regulatory controls, other than acceptable accounting standards, over funds to pay for\nliabilities. This is often the case, as in France, where the state effectively owns the nuclear\npower industry. The position in France is particularly interesting since the country will face\na substantial decommissioning bill as it has such a large nuclear power programme. In other\ncountries funds to meet nuclear liabilities have been established, often with legislative\nbacking, either associated with the nuclear power companies themselves, or separate from\nthem.\nThe following extract from Future Financial Liabilities of Nuclear Activities26 provides\ninformation about funding for radioactive waste disposal and the decommissioning of nuclear\nplants in other countries:\nWhile there are countries where no specific government requirements exist, other than\naccepted accounting standards, some have rules established by the government for creating\nfunds to pay the liabilities and for creating companies to undertake waste disposal and\ndecommissioning work.\nIn countries where the State owns industrial groups operating a large number of power plants\nor fuel cycle facilities, it has not generally been considered necessary to impose a requirement\nfor such funds. For example, this is the case of France where EDF is the sole operator of\nnuclear power plants and Cogema the fuel cycle company...\nIn the case of Japan, even though the State does not act as owner, the nuclear share of the\nutilities, added to their size, has given enough guarantee for the government to be able to rely\nprimarily on accounting standards. Legislation has established rules controlling the funds\nreserved for decommissioning of power plants and reprocessing spent fuel.\nOther countries such as Belgium, Finland, Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United States have\ncreated, by law, funding systems so as to assure that outside the regular balance sheet of the\noperators, i.e. not directly accessible to them, funds are available for the safe handling and\nfinal disposal of some or all of the waste arising and in some cases the decommissioning of\nthe nuclear facilities. In Korea and Belgium the fund is envisaged only for the disposal of the\nwaste and does not include the dismantling of the nuclear facilities which remains under the\nfinancial responsibility of the utility; in these two cases this fund is managed by a State-\nowned organisation.\nIn Belgium, the State and the utilities reached an agreement in 1985 by which the utilities\nconstitute the necessary provisions to cover dismantling and decommissioning costs. The\nprovisions are under the supervision of the \"Control Committee for Gas and Electricity\". The\nannual appropriations are revised every five years.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n26Future Financial Liabilities of Nuclear Activities Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic\nCo-operation and Development 1996\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 95/83\nIn Canada, the utilities operating nuclear power plants are owned by the provincial\ngovernments, and note in their financial statements the estimated costs for decommissioning\nand disposal of radioactive waste. The Atomic Energy Control Board, the competent\nauthority, has issued a Regulatory Policy Document by which licencees must identify costs\nfor decommissioning as early as the planning and design stage of a nuclear facility. A new\nregulation is expected to be introduced soon to replace the existing Atomic Energy Control\nAct. The new Act and the supporting regulations will include the need for the generator of\nliabilities to provide financial assurance for decommissioning to the satisfaction of prevailing\nregulations. For the case of uranium and thorium mining, a revised regulation was\npromulgated in 1994 in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for\ndecommissioning.\nIn Finland and Sweden, the holder of a power plant licence is responsible for ensuring that\nall measures are adopted for the safe handling and final disposal of nuclear waste, (or nuclear\nmaterial which is not to be reused) generated by the activities, and for the safe\ndecommissioning of facilities. This has led in Sweden, to the Financing Act of 1981, and in\nFinland to the Nuclear Energy Act of 1988. These laws are intended to guarantee that funds\nare available when different measures in the nuclear waste management programme are carried\nout. To achieve this, the reactor owners pay to the State a fee related to the energy supplied\nfrom each reactor. The fund is administered by the central government authority: in Finland\nthrough the Ministry of Trade and Industry with the State Nuclear Waste Management Fund\n(VYR); in Sweden, through the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate, SKI. VYR refunds\nassets in its fund which exceed the defined liabilities. The liabilities cover all waste types and\nall waste management measures including R & D. Guided by the Financing Act, SKI decides\non reimbursement to the nuclear power utilities of costs relating to management of spent\nnuclear fuel, the decommissioning of nuclear plants, and for R & D on these activities.\nIn Germany, the \"Endlagervorausleistungverordnung\" (Repository, Advance Payment\nOrdinance) of 1982 establishes a funding mechanism which entitles the Bundesamt fur\nStrahlenschutz (BfS, Federal Bureau for Radiation Protection) to collect advance payments\nfrom the waste producers to cover future costs for repository R & D, land purchase and legal\nactions, repository planning, construction and operation. Concerning decommissioning costs,\nthe \"German Commercial Law\" requires that money is set aside annually during the operating\nlife-time of the facility. Responsibility for the fund is retained by the owner of the facility\nwho has to follow accepted accounting standards in preparing annual accounts. The\noperator/owner of the facility has to justify the provisions to supervision boards, e.g.\nsupervisory auditors, certified public accountants.\nIn Spain, the law considers that the cost for disposal of the waste arising from nuclear power\nplants and their decommissioning is an external cost, and thus not the liability of the licence\nholder. Those responsibilities for radioactive waste disposal and decommissioning of nuclear\npower plants rest with a State-owned company. To ensure funding of that company, the\ngovernment approves a General Radioactive Waste Plan which includes both technical actions\nto be taken and the financial requirements during the expected life of the power plants. These\nexternal costs, revised annually, are reflected in the electricity prices paid bv the consumers.\nIn the United States there are funding mechanisms for the management of spent fuel and\ndecommissioning of the power plants. In the case of spent fuel the operator has to pay the\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) a levy on each kWh (kilowatt-hour) produced, while a financial\nassurance must guarantee the decommissioning of the radioactive portion of a nuclear power\nplant.\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 95/83\nV Further Reading\n1) Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Final Conclusions Cm 2919 \nJuly 1995\n2) The Prospect for Nuclear Power in the UK Cm 2860 May 1995\n3) Nuclear Privatisation Trade and Industry Select Committee Second Report HC 43-I\nand II 1995/96\n4) Government Observations on the Second Report from the Trade and Industry\nCommittee (session 1995-96) on Nuclear Privatisation  HC-383\n5) Nuclear Privatisation: Liabilities Left in the State Sector Mike Sadnicki \nCommissioned by the Consortium of Opposing Local Authorities and Friends of the\nEarth 5 June 1996\n6) The Nuclear Review - Some Technical Issues Parliament Office of Science and\nTechnology June 1994\n7) The Cost of Decommissioning Nuclear Facilities Report by the Comptroller and\nAuditor General National Audit Office 4 June 1993\n8) Nuclear Energy Programmes in OECD/NEA Countries OECD/NEA 1995\n18\n\n\nRecent Research Papers on related subjects include:\nEnergy\nTrade and Industry\nEnvironmental Issues\n\n\nResearch Paper\n94/31 The Nuclear Review 17.02.94\n96/3 Nuclear Privatisation 15.01.96\n96/30 Radioactive Waste: Some Topical Issues 29.02.96 \n \n\n\n\n"

Background\nThe Railways Act 1993 provided the legal framework for the privatisation of British Rail. The\nfirst franchises, South West Trains, Great Western and LTS Rail were awarded on 19 and 20\nDecember 1995 and the first two privatised services started operating on Sunday 4 February\n1996. Prequalification documents have been issued for all 25 companies and to date the\nfranchises have been awarded in eight cases.\n1. Railway Privatisation\nThe legislation to privatise the railways radically changed the structure of the railway industry\nby separating the responsibility for infrastructure and passenger service operations. The\nGovernment's intention was that all passenger services should eventually be provided by\nprivate sector operators either acting as franchisees or as independent train operators. The\nrailway network would be divided into a number of franchises, which would provide the bulk\nof passenger services. Government subsidy would be payable via the Franchising Director to\nfranchisees in respect of socially necessary services that might not otherwise be provided.\nCompetition in the provision of passenger services would be facilitated by allowing\nindependent train operators (ie non franchisee and not in receipt of subsidy) who could meet\nthe necessary operational and safety standards, to have a right of access to the railway\nnetwork.\nThe passenger railway has now been restructured so that domestic passenger train services can\nbe offered to the private sector to run on a franchised basis. Since 1993 the Office of\nPassenger Rail Franchising has worked in conjunction with BR, the Train Operating Units\n(TOUs), the Department of Transport, Railtrack and the Regulator on the preparation of BR's\npassenger services for franchising. Since 1 April 1994 British Rail has reorganised its\npassenger services into 25 different TOUs. These TOUs have gradually been incorporated as\nsubsidiaries of British Rail and have been run as separate \"shadow\" businesses within British\nRail. They pay access charges for the use of track and infrastructure, and rentals for stations\nand rolling stock, on the same basis as the franchisees do after franchising. Each operates\nunder its own licence (granted by the Rail Regulator), its Railway Safety Case (approved by\nthe Health and Safety Executive) and a track access agreement with Railtrack (approved by\nthe Regulator). A wide range of station and depot access agreements (also approved by the\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nRegulator), property leases and other contracts are also required by each train operating\nbusiness. The objective was to provide financial and operational information and experience\nof how the business would operate under the new arrangements and to give potential\nfranchisees financial and management information to assist them in tendering for the\nfranchises. \nEach of the 25 train operating companies is being offered for sale as a separate franchise.\nPrivate sector companies, management employee buy-outs and, if the Franchising Director\nagrees, British Rail can bid for the franchises through a bidding process overseen by the\nFranchising Director. The successful bidder acquires the TOC outright for a fixed number\nof years. \n2. The Franchising Director\nThe franchises are awarded by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising. The first\nFranchising Director, Mr. Roger Salmon, was appointed by the Secretary of State for\nTransport on 8 November 1993 for a term of 5 years. He announced in April that he would\nbe leaving the post in the Autumn.1 OPRAF is constituted as a non-ministerial Government\nDepartment and in January 1996 employed 88 people. This is due to rise to 121 by March\n1997 and 136 by March 1998.2 Costs for 1996-97 are budgeted at £7.9 million.3 The\nFranchising Director is responsible for securing the provision of railway passenger services\nby entering into franchise agreements, with franchisees being selected through a competitive\ntendering process. His main functions as laid down in the 1993 Act are:\n to designate passenger rail services or groups of such services eligible for provision\nunder franchise agreements;\n to invite tenders from prospective franchisees for the provision of services and to enter\ninto franchise agreements;\n to consider whether provisions are necessary to ensure that the fares to be charged by\nfranchisees are reasonable, and to secure the participation by franchisees in approved\ndiscount fare schemes;\n                                                                                                                                                            \n1 OPRAF press notice 10.4.96 \"Statement from Roger Salmon on his intention to leave the post of Franchising\nDirector in Autumn 1996\"\n2 PQ HC Deb 7.2.96 c.271W\n3 PQ HL Deb 12.2.96 WA 42\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\n to form a view on proposed closures of passenger services and to initiate the formal\nclosure procedures or, if his view is that a closure should not be permitted to take\neffect, to secure the continuation of the service;\n to enter into contracts with BR for the provision of non-franchised passenger services\nprior to these being franchised;\n to encourage railway investment;\n to promote the provision of staff concessionary travel;\n to provide support for those passenger services which BR provide under the European\nCommunity regulations governing the public service obligations which may be\nimposed on operators of passenger rail services.\nThe Act requires the Franchising Director to exercise his statutory functions so as to fulfil\nobjectives given to him by the Secretary of State and to ensure that his expenditure represents\nvalue for money in achieving these objectives. In March 1994 the Secretary of State set the\nFranchising Director the following principal objectives:4\n to secure that railway passenger services in Great Britain, other than exempted\nservices, are provided under franchise agreements as soon as reasonably practicable;\nand\n to secure an overall improvement in the quality of railway passenger and station\nservices available to railway passengers.\nOther objectives set by the Secretary of State were:\n to encourage efficiency and economy in the provision of railway services;\n to promote the use and cost-effective development of the railway network;\n to promote the award of franchise agreements to companies in which qualifying\nrailway employees have a substantial interest.\nThese objectives can be varied by the Government. On 11 December 1995 they were\namplified in relation to risk sharing, the funding of the services of Passenger Transport\n                                                                                                                                                            \n4 Department of Transport Objectives, Instructions and Guidance to the Franchising Director from the\nSecretary of State for Transport  22.3.94\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nExecutive areas, and the provision of concessionary travel for railway employees5 and on the\n18 December the Secretary of State announced further changes as a result of the court case\nby Save Our Railways. \nThe Objectives, Instructions and Guidance are set out in full in the Franchising Director's\nannual report. The guidance given on the specification of the franchise is reproduced below\nas this is the section which gave rise to the court case against the Franchising Director:\nFranchise specification\nLength of franchise\n15. You should determine the length of franchises case by case in the light of market\nconditions and after consultation with me.\nScope of franchise\n16. Subject to Railtrack's agreement, franchises should normally include the management of\nstations, with the management of other infrastructure (track and signalling) remaining with\nRailtrack. Exceptionally, where, for example, franchised services operate over network\nwhere no other franchises will be operating, and there seems very little prospect of other\nrail operators wishing to use that network, you may consider that you would secure better\nvalue for money if you proposed a degree of vertical integration, ie partial operation of the\nnetwork as well as trains by the franchises. Any such proposals will be subject to\nRailtrack's agreement. You are to consult me and obtain my approval before offering\nvertically integrated franchises.\n17. Franchisees may wish to operate charter services, which may, for example, involve the\noperation of heritage rolling stock. Charter services are purely commercial ventures and\nmust not, therefore, form any part of your franchise specifications.\nQuality of service\n18. For the initial letting of franchises, your specification of minimum service levels for\nrailway passenger services is to be based on that being provided by BR immediately prior\nto franchising, taking into account the existence of and justification for variations in\nservice schedules.\n19. The detail of your specifications should depend on the nature of the service to which they\nrelate. Service levels may be specified in terms of the following:\n• service frequency and capacity;\n• service availability (for example, the need for evening and weekend services);\n• provision of through services by fast trains;\n• intermediate stations served; and\n                                                                                                                                                            \n5 PQ HC Deb 11.12.95 c. 460W; Deposited Paper 2496 (3S)\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\n• journey time.\n20. Service quality for railway passenger services and station services operated by franchisees\nshould be specified in the degree of detail that is appropriate for the particular franchise.\nFor some franchises, particularly those conferring monopoly power, you should ensure that\nthe franchise agreement provides an effective substitute for market pressures. For other\nfranchises, where market pressures are present to a greater extent, you should impose such\nservice quality requirements as are necessary to ensure that the taxpayer obtains good value\nfor money.\n21. When you are specifying the quality of service to be provided:\ni) the performance standards which you set for franchisees should have the effect of\nmaintaining or improving standards;\nii) your specification of the quality of service to be provided by franchisees, should,\nas far as possible, be in terms of the desired outputs, so leaving operators as much\nfreedom as possible for responding innovatively to passengers' demands;\niii) you must require each franchisee to publish their own Passenger's Charter.  This\nshould include the franchisee's own code of conduct for dealing with passengers,\npublishing performance information, handling complaints, and payment of\ncompensation to passengers in the event of poor performance.\n22. Whatever the length of the franchise, it will be important to ensure that service patterns do\nnot ossify, and that operators are able to adjust services to match demand. You should,\ntherefore, conclude franchise agreements that permit flexibility in service provision within\na framework you have agreed.\n23. Although service specifications set for the initial franchises must be based on the timetable\nbeing operated by BR immediately prior to franchising, you should aim, over time, to\ntailor the provision of franchised services more closely to demand. In large part this\ntailoring should be driven by franchisees responding on a commercial basis to passenger\ndemand:that is why I want you to leave maximum scope for the initiative of franchisees in\nyour franchise specifications as noted in paragraph 4 above. Any changes from the existing\npattern of services should be made gradually.\n24. In order for you to decide appropriate service specifications for loss-making services you\nwill need to develop criteria which will enable you to evaluate the benefits to be obtained\nfrom their provision. Such criteria must be submitted to me for approval.\nOn 24 November 1995 the pressure group Save Our Railways, an anti-privatisation group\nbacked by 20 local authorities, the three main rail unions and several MPs, obtained a judicial\nreview into \"unlawful decisions\" by Roger Salmon, the Franchising Director, to cut services.\nIt challenged the legality of the franchising proposals put forward on the grounds that he had\nfailed to base the minimum passenger service levels on the current BR timetable as instructed\nby the former Transport Secretary, John MacGregor. Mr. Salmon had set standards in some\ncases well below the existing timetable on the grounds that private franchisees would have\na strong commercial incentive to run more trains. On 7 December the High Court ruled that\nRoger Salmon had not set the future minimum passenger services too low but on 15\nDecember the Court of Appeal overturned the ruling in relation to the second group of\nfranchises.6 The key section in the ruling said that: \n                                                                                                                                                            \n6 Times 18.12.95 \"Regina v Director of Passenger Rail Franchising, ex parte Save our Railways and others\"\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\n\"'Based on' is not...an exact term. It is obvious that every train timetabled by\nBR need not continue to run. There may be changes...but there is a limit. The\nchanges must in our view be marginal, not significant or substantial.\" \nThe judges said they would not intervene in the Great Western minimum service level, set\nat 86 per cent of the current timetable, or in South West Trains with a level set at 86 to 89\nper cent. But LTS Rail with a level of 69 per cent, InterCity East Coast with 71 per cent and\nGatwick with 45 per cent, were found to be unacceptable. However the LTS Rail franchise\nsale could proceed as there had been an \"undue delay in launching the attempt to block it.\"\nRewriting the minimum service requirements would have been time consuming and costly and\nthe Government instead rephrased its instructions to the Franchising Director. Sir George\nYoung said in the House of Commons:7\nWe have, of course, given careful consideration\nto the implications of the court's judgment. I\nconfirm that, as planned, the franchising director\nhopes to announce the award of the first three\nfranchises later this week, and I welcome the\ncourt's agreement that he should go ahead with\nthem.\nThe court has been concerned with the\nconsistency between the franchising director's\ninstructions and guidance and the PSRs. It is, in the\ncourt's words, a \"limited legal problem\". The court\nhas not questioned the Government's policy. Indeed,\nthe judgment describes the franchising director's\napproach to developing PSRs as\n\"intelligible and in no way irrational\".\nThe franchising director has prepared his PSRs\nin a manner which my predecessors and I have\nconsistently approved. We believed them to be\nconsistent with the formal instructions and guidance\nthat were given to him. The Court of Appeal has\nnow examined the meaning of the existing\ninstructions and guidance and concluded that the\nexisting PSRs are not consistent with them.\nI have decided, therefore, to clarify the\ninstructions and guidance to the franchising director\nto ensure that they reflect beyond doubt the policy\nthat we have always followed. Franchisees should\nhave flexibility to adjust commercial services but\nthe franchise agreement should ensure that a core\nservice level is protected so that service levels\noperated by franchisees are broadly similar to those\noperated immediately prior to franchising. My\nintention is to ensure that the work done in\ndeveloping the PSRs so far can be relied on in the\ncontinuing franchising process.\nI am pleased to tell the House that, while\nclarifying the franchising director's instructions, I\nintend to go beyond the requirements of the Court\nof Appeal judgment. I shall instruct him, when\nconsidering the award of future franchises, to take\naccount of bidders' contractual commitments to, and\nfuture plans for, providing services over and above\nthe PSR. In practice, bidders for the first franchises\nare offering significant commitments in addition to\nthe minima required by the invitations to tender,\nand they have been taken into account by the\nfranchising director when evaluating bids, but I\nhave judged it right to require him formally to do\nso for the future to ensure the continuation of that\npolicy.\nParagraphs 18 to 24 of the Franchising Director's Guidance were amended. The change had\nthe effect of codifying the Franchising Director's existing practice and was designed to resolve\nany apparent conflict between the former wording of the instructions and the Government's\nintentions. Paragraph 18 contains the most important rewording:8\n                                                                                                                                                            \n7 HC Deb 18.12.95 cc 1236-1246\n8 Department of Transport 15.1.96; Deposited Paper 2614 (3S)\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nWhen setting minimum service levels for services being franchised for the first time, you\nshould take as your starting point the service being provided by BR at the time when you\ndraw up the specification, taking into account the existence of and justification for seasonal\nvariations in service schedules. You should take particular account of the nature of the\nservices concerned. Each service should be considered individually, taking account of all\nsurrounding circumstances. For example, where you judge that services are essential but\nwhere they are unprofitable to run, you should set the minimum close to or at the current level\nof service. Conversely where service levels have been set by BR on a commercial basis, as\nwith most of the former InterCity routes and with off-peak services on commuter routes, you\nshould leave maximum flexibility for franchisees while safeguarding what you believe to be\na reasonable core service level. On any route, where you judge that a train is exceptionally\nlightly used and is not an essential service you should omit it from the minimum specification\nif you consider that to include it would not provide value for money. You should use load\nfactor regulation where you believe it to be appropriate in order to ensure that peak commuter\nservice levels are kept in line with changes in passenger demand.\n3. The Rail Regulator\nAlthough the Franchising Director has the direct input in the awarding of franchises, the Rail\nRegulator has a significant role in deciding the legal and economic background in which a\nfranchisee will operate. The Secretary of State appoints the Regulator for a five year period\nand once appointed he cannot be removed except for \"incapacity or misbehaviour.\" John Swift\nwas appointed in December 1993. Until 31 December 1996 he has a duty to take account of\nany guidance from the Secretary of State. \nThe Regulator is responsible for issuing licences to railway operators. In general all\ncompanies operating railway assets need to be licensed and the Regulator is responsible for\nenforcing licence conditions concerning such matters as policing, the environment, insurance\nrequirements and through ticketing. No track, train, station or depot may be operated without\na licence. \nHe also approves access agreements between Railtrack and the train operators by which the\nlatter acquire the right to use the track, stations and light maintenance depots, and he may\nmodify them. About half the income of the passenger train operators will go to Railtrack to\npay for access to the track so the level of these charges is of importance to the companies.\nInitially the Government demanded that Railtrack earn an annual return of 5.1 per cent, rising\nto 8 per cent after four years. The level of track access charges which would have been\nnecessary to meet those charges would have meant that almost all the passenger services\nwould be loss making and so reliant on subsidy. In February 1994, it was estimated that the\nrail passenger operators could expect to pay about £2.2bn in charges to run their trains. \nThe Regulator concluded that charges should be rebased in 1995-96 with an overall reduction\nin access charges for franchised passenger services of 8% in real terms compared with\n1994-95. Individual track access charges for franchised passenger services should fall by 2%\na year in real terms from 1996-97 onwards, broadly in line with the reduction in Railtrack's\noverall costs. There should be a further review of access charges in 2000 with the\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nconclusions to be reflected in all access agreements for franchised passenger services from\n1 April 2001. Additional charges are levied for the use of stations and to fund specific new\ninvestment projects. A system of performance-related payments is also to be used to reflect\nachievement of quality of service objectives, for example the punctuality of trains.\nThe Regulator is also instrumental in deciding the level of competition. In July 1994 he\npublished a consultation paper on competition in railway passenger services and in December\nhe published his policy statement on the subject.9 The Regulator accepted that competition\nwould have to be moderated to an extent in order to secure a successful transfer of passenger\noperations to the private sector through franchising. Although he said he remained convinced\nthat there were substantial benefits to both the train operators and the passengers through\nincreased competition, he concluded that for an initial period competition between operators\nshould be restricted. Only companies that take up train operating franchises will be allowed\nto offer passenger services during the first four years of privatisation and severe restrictions\nwill be imposed on new entrants for three years thereafter.\nThe Regulator's functions under the Railways Act also enable him to concern himself with a\nwide range of consumer interests. Even in cases where he does not have a statutory function,\nhe frequently has a formal right to be consulted. The Regulator recognises that the benefits\nthat an integrated network can provide may need protecting and he may secure many of these\nbenefits through conditions in operators' licences. These will require operators to participate\nin industry-wide arrangements covering:\n through ticketing and ticket retailing\n telephone enquiry bureaux\n publication of the national timetable and the sharing of operating information between\nlicence holders \n insurance\n claims handling\nThrough ticketing and inter-availability need to be available to passengers. \"Through\"\njourneys refer to journeys involving more than one passenger train operator and inter-available\ntickets mean that tickets issued by one train operating company are available for the same\njourney on other operators' trains.\nThe Railways Act made provision for through ticketing to be a condition of a passenger\nservice operator's licence. The idea originally was that the use of British Rail's existing\nticketing and revenue allocation systems would mean that operators would be able to offer\n                                                                                                                                                            \n9 Office of the Rail Regulator Competition for Railway Passenger Services December 1994\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nthrough tickets on much the same basis as did BR. Through tickets would therefore continue\nto be available from a range of outlets and in a range of ticket and fare types.10 \nIn his consultation paper on the retailing of tickets, the Rail Regulator commented that there\nwas no reason to follow BR's practice unless there was a good reason for it. Interested parties\nwere asked to consider the possibility of a new type of system based on what was called core\nproducts -a wide range of tickets which must be offered for sale - and core stations - those\nrequired to sell the core products. The proposals in the paper would have resulted in only 294\nstations being designated core stations. The document produced considerable adverse reaction\nand when the Regulator published his conclusions he decided that operators should be obliged\nto maintain the service currently provided although there would be a procedure to allow for\nchanges in the system provided they could be shown to improve the system for the\ncustomer.11\nFor most journeys, including through journeys, passengers will be able to buy both full and\ndiscounted inter-available tickets, the fares for which will be set by the main operator on a\nroute. The provision of inter-available tickets will be obligatory except in those cases where\nthe Franchising Director considers the benefits of price competition outweigh those of inter-\navailability. Competing operators may introduce additional non-inter-available fares which\nallow passengers to trade flexibility in return for a lower price.\nNew routing rules are also being considered. The British Rail rule of tickets being sold for\ntravel between two stations by \"any reasonable route\" is apparently to be replaced by the\nmore restrictive \"any permitted route.\" The change was proposed because the degree of\nfreedom passengers now have makes it difficult to allocate ticket revenues between the 25\nprivatised train operators. An official list of permitted routes would, it was hoped, avoid\ndisputes between passengers and ticket inspectors. At present inspectors have a great deal of\ndiscretion over whether a passenger is taking a reasonable route but this frequently leads to\ncomplaints. In future passengers will know at the start of their journey which routes they are\npermitted to take. Details are still being worked out. \n4. Disputes Committees\nThe Government announced on 14 January 1996 that it would set up two committees to\nresolve disputes between the privatised companies in the hope of avoiding costly and time\nconsuming legal actions.12 One committee is intended to resolve disputes about track access\ncharges and timetables between train operators and Railtrack while the second will consider\nall other issues including liability for claims. In the past such disputes would have been\n                                                                                                                                                            \n10 Department of Transport press notice 2.2.93\n11 Office of the Rail Regulator Ticket Retailing: A Policy Statement April 1995\n12 Financial Times 15.1.96 \n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nresolved internally within British Rail but now there are 25 passenger train operating\ncompanies among a total of more than 80 companies providing rail services.\n5. Competition\nThe Government believed the absence of competition in the railway industry was a major\nproblem. It wanted competing train companies out bidding each other to provide quicker and\ncheaper services. In fact franchisees have been assured by the Regulator that new operators\nwill not be allowed to compete in the first four years and there will be restrictions until 2002.\nThe Regulator will review the competitive regime in 2001.\nThe bus industry is now dominated by relatively few large companies and it is possible that\nin future years the railways could be the same with perhaps 10 passenger operating companies\nrather than the present 25. Any competition issues raised by a rail franchise bid are for the\nFranchising Director, the Rail Regulator and the Director General of Fair Trading. The\nRailways Act 1993 confers on the Rail Regulator the functions of the Director General of Fair\nTrading with respect to monopoly situations or anti-competitive practices relating to the\nsupply of rail services. Qualifying mergers would be investigated by the OFT under the Fair\nTrading Act 1973. \nSo far only one franchise has caused the OFT concern and that is the acquisition of Midland\nMainline by National Express. This was referred to the MMC on 30 July 1996 not because\nthe company already had a train franchise but because it operated express coach services over\nsome of the same routes as the railway it was acquiring. Brian Wilson MP has already said\nthat if it wins the next election, the Labour Party will consider referring Stagecoach to the\nOFT to investigate the monopoly implications of the company acting as both bus and train\noperator in the same area.13 \nThe Rail Regulator is also required to approve any change of control of a licence holder.\n                                                                                                                                                            \n13 Guardian 12.12.95\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nB. The Franchising Process\nA franchise is the right to run specified services within a specified area for a specified period\nof time, in return for the right to charge fares and, where appropriate, to receive support from\nthe Franchising Director. Service standards are monitored by the Franchising Director\nthroughout the duration of the franchise. Franchisees earn revenue primarily from fares and\nfrom subsidy. They generally lease stations from Railtrack and earn rental income by sub-\nletting parts of them, for example to retailers. The rights and obligations are specified in a\nfranchise agreement between the Franchising Director and the train operator. Each franchise\nis negotiated individually with the Franchising Director. Franchisees have to co-operate in\ncertain central arrangements such as those necessary to provide through-ticketing and revenue\nsettlement between train operators.\nFranchisees' main costs are the track access charges they pay to Railtrack, the costs of leasing\nstations and rolling stock and of employing staff. Franchisees may do light maintenance work\non rolling stock themselves or contract it out to private sector companies. Heavy maintenance\nis normally procured for them by the rolling stock leasing companies (ROSCOs) according\nto the contracts between them.\nFranchises operate as commercial businesses. Prospective franchisees will include within their\nbids either the premium they are prepared to pay for the right to operate services, or the level\nof support they estimate they will require. Tenders may also include proposals for new\nservices or improved facilities.\nThe principal factors the Franchising Director considers when awarding franchises include the\nlevel of support bid for, the service commitments offered and the degree of risk accepted by\nthe prospective franchisee. The Franchising Director has stated that, in negotiating franchises,\nhe wishes to give franchisees as much scope as possible to maximise their return on the\noperation of passenger services consistent with a high quality railway system, a good service\nfor passengers and value for money for the taxpayer. \n1. The Stages of a Franchise\nThe sale of a franchise has five stages:\n pre-qualification;\n invitation to tender;\n due diligence by potential bidders;\n submission of tenders;\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\n assessment of tenders and award of the franchise.\nPre-qualification is a statutory requirement. Under section 26(3) of the Railways Act 1993 the\nFranchising Director is required to be satisfied before issuing an invitation to tender (ITT) that\nthe bidder has an appropriate financial position, managerial competence and is otherwise\nsuitable to run a franchise. According to the OPRAF pre-qualification document,14 the\nFranchising Director reserves the right to refuse pre-qualification and is not obliged to give\nany reason for such a refusal. Prospective franchisees who meet the pre-qualification criteria\nare sent the formal Invitation to Tender (ITT) and associated Information Memorandum.\nPotential bidders who pre-qualify may participate in a \"due diligence\" programme including\nvisits to the company, meetings with the management and access to data. A shortlist is drawn\nup by the Franchising Director from those companies who have responded to the ITT and\nthese companies are invited to submit a formal bid upon which the franchise is awarded. As\nwith the pre-qualification bids the Franchising Director reserves the right not to accept a\ntender on the grounds of price or otherwise and without giving any reason for his decision.\nOnce a successful bidder signs the franchise agreement, there are certain legal formalities to\nbe completed and the franchisee's safety case to be approved before the first train can run. \nSection 26(1) of the Railways Act gives the Secretary of State the right to overrule the\nFranchise Director in the choice of franchisee:\n26.--(1) Unless the Secretary of State otherwise directs, the person who is to be the franchisee\nunder any franchise agreement shall be selected by the Franchising Director from among those\nwho submit tenders in response to an invitation to tender under this section for the right to\nprovide, or to secure that a wholly owned subsidiary provides, services for the carriage of\npassengers by railway under that franchise agreement.\n(2) The Franchising Director shall prepare any such invitation to tender and shall issue that\ninvitation to such persons as he may, after consultation with the Regulator, think fit.\n(3) The Franchising Director shall not issue an invitation to tender under this section to (or\nentertain such a tender from) any person unless he is of the opinion that the person has, or is\nlikely by the commencement of the franchise term to have, an appropriate financial position\nand managerial competence, and is otherwise a suitable person, to be the franchisee. \nThe contracts are between the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising and the franchisee. Each\nfranchise has a separate contract. The Government in its instructions to the Franchising\nDirector said \"you are not expected to negotiate uniform franchise agreements.\"15 Each\nfranchise contract is a legal document and if either side breaks the terms of the contract it will\nbe liable to legal proceedings. The contract could only be terminated with the agreement of\nboth parties and if one side withdrew, it would be likely to lead to damages. Even legislation\ncould be a problem and would involve substantial compensation. \n                                                                                                                                                            \n14 OPRAF Passenger Rail Franchising:Pre-qualification Document December 1994\n15 Op cit\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nThe franchises were expected to be for seven years but participants in the franchising process\nhave criticised the length of the franchises offered as being too short to make any investment\nworthwhile and the Franchising Director does now seem to be prepared to consider longer\nagreements. At the end of the franchise period the service will be available for the Franchising\nDirector to pass to another body, either a private company, to British Rail or to a new\npublicly owned company. There may be some assets belonging to the former franchisee to be\nnegotiated but the franchise companies own very little other than the right to run a passenger\nservice over a particular line.\nRoger Salmon announced on 14 December 1994 that \"Passengers can be assured that I will\nbe building in safeguards for all existing routes and stations, to maintain network benefits, to\nregulate fares for commuters, and to assume that franchise operators meet the needs of\npassengers.\" He described these safeguards as follows:16\n\"Required Services - a Passenger Service Requirement (PSR) on operators to\nprovide a defined level of services. This will cover frequency of trains, stations\nserved, journey times, first and last trains, weekend services and, where\nnecessary to prevent overcrowding, capacity standards. Every route and station\nwill be included in the PSR. Operators will be free to run services above those\nrequired by the Franchising Director.\nThrough Tickets - through tickets will continue to be available for all\njourneys. As now, passengers will be able to buy an inter-available ticket on\nmost routes. This extends across a range of fares including full price and\ndiscount tickets. In future, the Franchising Director will only remove the inter-\navailability requirement where he considers that there are likely to be greater\nbenefits for passengers, such as more choice or lower fares.\nRailcards - Young, Senior and Disabled Person Railcards will be mandatory,\nas will the London Travelcard. Operators have agreed voluntary arrangements\nto enable them to continue to provide other Railcards (e.g. Family and\nNetwork).\nFares Regulation - the Franchising Director will regulate fares for commuter\njourneys into London and for some other routes. Permitted fare increases will\nbe linked to the quality of service provided. PTEs will regulate fares in their\nown areas.\nEnsuring Franchise Performance - there will be financial incentives for\noperators to deliver good quality service. Regular customer satisfaction surveys,\nindependently audited, will be carried out on issues important to passengers.\nFranchise operators will be required to produce a Passenger's Charter with, as\nnow, published standards of performance and compensation arrangements\".\n                                                                                                                                                            \n16 OPRAF news release 14.12.94 p.2\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\n2. Passenger Service Requirements\nThe Passenger Service Requirement sets out the minimum service levels for train services and\nis produced by the Franchising Director. Each PSR is specific to the franchise. The draft PSR\nis for consultation only and appears at about the same time as the pre-qualifying bids are\ninvited. The final PSR is the one on which the prospective franchisees will base their bids.\nIn January 1995 Dr. Mawhinney, then Secretary of State, explained how the PSR would work.\nHe spoke of the two different requirements of the rail services: one to vary and develop\nexisting services in response to demand and the other to offer reassurance to passengers\nthrough a guaranteed service.17 Without the first, the benefits and opportunities offered by\nthe introduction of private ownership, management and finance would be foregone. The\nsecond requirement is needed to ensure the Franchising Director can purchase, on behalf of\npassengers and the taxpayer, the appropriate level of service he judges to be necessary. These\ntwo objectives are reconciled through the PSR. At the time he stressed that the PSRs were\nnot future timetables. These would be for the operators and Railtrack to develop. The PSR\nprovided the guaranteed minimum safeguard. Where a service was not commercially\nattractive, the PSR was likely to provide for broadly the existing level of service but where\nthe service was commercially attractive, the PSR was likely to be below the existing level to\ngive the operator the opportunity to develop new and varied services within an assured\nframework.\nThe Franchising Director sets out a level of services in the PSR which the franchisee must\noperate. It in effect provides the level of service which the Franchising Director is buying and\nfor which he will make support payments, if necessary, under the Franchise Agreement. A\ndistinction is made between the uneconomic services for which the PSR will be very similar\nto the existing timetable and the commercial routes such as the successful intercity routes.\nIn these cases the Franchising Director does not consider that he should be subsidising\nprofitable routes and the PSR is likely to include only a token reference. Franchisees can run\nextra services according to their commercial judgment and are given the flexibility to\ndetermine detailed timetables in conjunction with Railtrack. \nThe Franchising Director's publication in January 1995 of his consultation paper on the PSRs\nfor the first four services to be let to the public sector caused a considerable furore as the\nminimum requirements were considerably below the service levels currently provided.18\nOperators must submit to the Franchising Director details of their proposed timetable. The\nFranchising Director will ensure these are compliant with the PSR and will monitor the actual\nservices run. The PSR is included as part of the franchise agreement. If operators do not\ndeliver the proper timetable, the Franchising Director may impose penalties or, as a last resort,\nterminate the franchise agreement.\n                                                                                                                                                            \n17 Department of Transport press notice 27.1.95 Speech by Dr. Mawhinney\n18 OPRAF news release 30.1.95; PQ HC Deb 7.2.95 cc 202-250\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\n3. Income\nA franchisee's main sources of income are the subsidy it receives from the Government and\nthe money it raises from fares.\ni Subsidies\nIn July 1995 the Transport Committee published a report which concluded that privatisation\nwould cost the taxpayer an additional £500-£700 million p.a. simply to maintain services at\nthe existing levels.19 In its response the Government said the increased financial support would\nbe systematically reduced through private sector efficiency:20\n\"The Government does not believe that the situation assumed by the committee, in\nwhich there is no growth in revenue or reductions in costs, is realistic. The\nimprovements in efficiency and choice that will flow from privatisation ... will benefit\ncustomers through improved services and taxpayers through better value for money.\"\nSubsidy payments for rail services are paid out of sums allocated by the Secretary of State\nfor that purpose. Since 1 April 1994 OPRAF has been responsible for making those payments\non behalf of central government. \nThe Department of Transport's consultation document on franchising stated that the subsidy\npaid to a franchisee, either an amount or the formula by which it is to be calculated, would\nbe determined in advance for the whole period of the franchise but both grant and service\nagreement may be subject to periodic review.21 There may also be adjustment factors with\nagreed 'triggers' in the franchise contract terms, for example to take account of changes in\ncosts over which the franchisee has no control. \nThe intervals at which payments are made from Franchising Authority to franchisee or vice\nversa will be laid down in the individual franchise contracts (section 29(1) of the Railways\nAct 1993).\nThe present Government has stated that it will continue to pay subsidy, where necessary, for\nas long as it is needed to secure the provision of socially necessary services. This promise is\nnot binding on a new government. A new government could theoretically reduce the total\namount of money it gives OPRAF to support the railways as this is part of its public\nexpenditure decision and is not set out in the Railways Act. However, the Franchising Director\n                                                                                                                                                            \n19 Transport Committee Railway Finances Fourth Report 1994-95, 5 July 1995 HC 206 1994-95\n20 Transport Committee Government Observations on the Fourth Report, First Special Report 1995-96, 29\nNovember 1995 - HC 71 1995-96\n21 Department of Transport The Franchising of Passenger Rail Services October 1992 \n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nmay not pay out in excess of the Secretary of State's allocation and if he could no longer pay\nthe subsidies agreed under contract with the franchisees, the contracts and PSRs would have\nto be renegotiated to reflect the reduced amount of money available. This would not effect\nthe lease agreements for rolling stock and the Railtrack charges which would continue at the\nold rate.\nSection 29(7) of the Railways Act 1993 makes the Secretary of State ultimately responsible:\n\"Any sums required by the Franchising Director for the payment of any grant, or for the making\nof any other payment, in consequence of any condition or other provision of a franchise agreement\nshall be paid by the Secretary of State out of money provided by Parliament\"\nThis point was raised in the evidence given by the Mr. Salmon, the Franchising Director, to\nthe Transport Committee during its hearing on railway finances:22\nMr Hill\n293. You expect, Mr. Salmon, to let the first\nfranchise bid at the end of 1995. The working\nassumption is that this will be a 7-year franchise.\nYou know your budget for 1995 is £1.61 billion,\nand you expect your budget to be of that order for\nthe next two years. What assumptions do you make\nfor the budget for the three, four or five years after\nthat, up to the end of the franchise period?\n(Mr. Salmon) I will be entering into franchise\nagreements which will be long-term commitments\nof the Government. Those commitments will be\nbased on passenger service requirements which are\nalso designed for the long-term. They are being\nprepared on the basis of instructions from the\nSecretary of State that he wishes me to base those\nPSRs on the existing timetable being run by British\nRail. It is for the Government to provide me with\nfunding to allow me to discharge those obligations.\nThere are many precedents for the fact that when\nthe Government enters into contracts it will be for\nthem to find the money to honour those obligations\nthat it enters into.\n294. The fact that we are into a contract\nsituation with these railway services is the great\ndistinguishing factor from past experience where, of\ncourse, we know  indeed you were kind enough to\nconcede this yourself in December 1993 when you\nfirst appeared before us  in fact, the experience of\nBritish Rail is that funding is highly variable and\ncan change not merely from a 3-year period in the\nPES round, but it can actually change at 12 months'\nnotice. But you are absolutely confident that the\nfunding will be available, at the agreed level, for\nthe entire duration of the franchising contracts?\n(Mr Salmon) As far as I am aware the British\nGovernment has always honoured its contractual\nobligations.\n295. So you are absolutely confident that the\npotential private operator will have the money that\nthey expect to have over the period of the\nfranchise?\n(Mr Salmon) Yes, the Railways Act provides\nspecifically that obligations of the Franchising\nDirector under franchise agreements are to be met\nby the Secretary of State out of money voted by\nParliament.\n                                                                                                                                                            \n22 Op cit Volume II pp 126-7\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nThe following PQ gave details of the subsidy arrangements of the eight franchises so far let:23\nRail Franchising\nMr. Chidgey: To ask the Secretary of State for\nTransport by how much the subsidy requirements of\nthe railway franchises which have so far been let fall\nbelow the claim made by BR for financial support\nless any administered profit; and if he will list the\nreductions for each franchise over the next seven\nyears. \nMr. Watts: The table shows the reductions in\nsupport for passenger rail services required by private\nsector franchisees compared with the BR budget,\nexcluding \nbudgeted administered profit. The grant figures for\nfranchisees include costs associated with the\nsubstantial additional investment in rail services to\nwhich they are committed. Because the BR figures\nexclude administered profit, this comparison makes\nno allowance for the additional benefit to the\ntaxpayer of transferring financial risk from the public\nto the private sector through franchising.\nNonetheless, the figures show that, after an initial\nincrease, the net financial burden on the taxpayer will\nfall by nearly £200 million by the seventh year.\n£ million\nFranchise year\nBR budget 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nSWT 65.940 -4.632 -5.275 -7.561 -12.527 -17.189 -22.340 -25.668\nGW 45.690 15.185 10.943 6.279 0.409 -5.146 -8.180 -10.456\nICEC 56.890 9.497 -4.139 -23.157 -42.399 -51.589 -55.092 -56.890\nMML 10.480 7.001 -3.168 -8.555 -9.696 -11.143 -13.088 -14.888\nGX -3.930 -0.597 3.930 -3.917 -5.727 -6.551 -7.309 -7.794\nNSC 93.030 -6.362 -22.449 -43.063 -48.138 -51.356 -56.346 -58.388\nLTS 30.670 -1.180 -4.064 -6.673 -8.143 -9.523 -10.819 -12.035\n£ million\nFranchise year\nBR budget 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nChiltem 16.470 0.052 -3.474 -4.613 -7.870 -10.896 -12.348 -13.600\nTotal 315.240 18.964 -27.696 -91.260 -134.091 -163.393 -185.522 -199.719\nThe BR budget is the latest available. For GW and SWT it is the revised 1995-96, for the others the preliminary 1996-97.\nPositive numbers indicate price increases, negative numbers price decreases.\nThe BR budget figure for South West Trains and Great Western refers to the final 1995-96 budget, since these two franchises began\noperations during the financial year 1995-96. The remaining BR budget figures refer to the preliminary 1996-97 budget, which is still subject\nto negotiation between the BR Board and the Franchising Director.\nii Fares\nFares are the other main source of income. Directions issued by the Secretary of State to the\nFranchising Director require him to control fares where he considers it necessary to avoid\nabuse of market power and to ensure that fares are reasonable. Overall the view of the\nFranchising Director is that where effective competition is provided by other forms of\n                                                                                                                                                            \n23 PQ HC Deb 18.7.96 cc 656-7W\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\ntransport, market forces are more efficient than regulation in keeping fares at a reasonable\nlevel. Where he does decide to regulate, the provisions are contained in the franchise\nagreement and he will specify the maximum rate of a fare rise which may take place during\nthe term of the franchise.\nA joint announcement was made by then Secretary of State, Dr. Mawhinney, and the\nFranchising Director on 15 May 1995 giving details of the policy on fares regulation. From\n1 January 1996, increases in capped fares will not be permitted to be more than the RPI from\nthe 1995 base price. For the four years from 1 January 1999, the price cap will be RPI minus\none. Unless the Franchising Director decides otherwise, the price cap from 1 January 2003\nwill continue to be RPI minus one.\nFranchisees may not change the terms and conditions of the statutorily protected Young\nPerson's, Senior and Disabled Person's Railcards. The Family Railcard and Network Card will\ncontinue. Operators cannot withdraw from the latter two schemes without the agreement of\nat least one third of the franchisees.\n4. Contractual Arrangements\nThe key feature of the restructured railway industry is that it no longer has a vertically\nintegrated structure as was the case prior to 1 April 1994. Many of the elements which make\nup a passenger service - rolling stock, track, stations, train operation and a range of other\nservices, from catering to car parking for commuters - now involve commercially negotiated\ncontracts. The former \"commercial\" structure of BR has been replaced by a \"contractual\"\nstructure.\n \nEach train operating company will rely on a number of contracts with suppliers of various\nservices within the privatised rail industry including:\n• The track access agreement with Railtrack gives a TOC the right to run trains on\nRailtrack's track within the agreed timetable. The track access agreement incorporates\na performing regime which provides incentives to Railtrack to encourage punctuality\nand reliability of services. It also provides for compensation to be paid to TOCs in\nsome circumstances for the effects of poor performance by Railtrack.\n• Where a TOC has day-to-day responsibility for operating a station (a \"Station Facility\nOwner\"), there will be a lease from Railtrack, which owns all stations.\n• A TOC will also require access agreements to allow its trains to stop at stations\noperated by other TOCs. When such a station access agreement is granted, the\noperator also enters into a collateral agreement with Railtrack. This enables Railtrack\nand the operator to enforce certain rights and obligations against each other without\nalways having to involve the Station Facility Owner.\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\n• A small number of stations - \"independent stations\" - are operated directly by\nRailtrack, and it is Railtrack which will grant station access agreements in these cases.\n• A TOC which operates a light maintenance depot will have a depot lease with\nRailtrack and will enter into depot access agreements with other TOCs who wish to\nuse that depot's maintenance services. Again, a train operator obtaining access\nagreement will enter into a collateral agreement with Railtrack.\n• Use of rolling stock is obtained through contracts with the ROSCOs. Some flexibility\nis provided by the fact that a proportion of the leases will be short-term, but most of\nthem will run for the same length of time as the franchise itself. Since ROSCOs\nmaintain ownership of the rolling stock, they are responsible for heavy maintenance.\nThis may be performed for the ROSCOs under contracts by those TOCs which have\nthe capacity to carry out such maintenance.\n• All TOCs will participate through ATOC (the Association of TOCs) in various\nschemes as part of the ticketing and settlement agreement. These cover matters such\nas fare setting, fares distribution, through fares and inter-availability, retailing of\ntickets, ticket brands, discount cards, staff travel and the provision of telephone\nenquiry bureaux. These schemes should enable operators to offer network-wide\nproducts to passengers.\nOther contracts will exist between TOCs and the British Rail Board support businesses\ncovering, for example, on board catering, computing and software support services and\nrailway telephone lines. \n5. Conclusion\nDetails of all the franchising agreements are available to the public via the Franchising\nDirector's Register which can be seen at the OPRAF office. In addition the Franchising\nDirector has entered on the Register the provisions of the Disabled, Senior, Young Persons\nand Staff travel schemes.\nAll train operating companies, including European Passenger Services, are members of the\nAssociation of Train Operating Companies. Its purpose is two-fold: to ensure the continuation\nof network benefits such as inter-available ticketing, impartial ticket retailing and railcards,\nand to act as a trade association, promoting the rail network and lobbying.\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nThe first seven franchise awards can be summarised as follows:24\nThe first seven franchise awards\nFranchise TOC Franchise\nlength (years)\nSubsidy\nyear one\nSubsidy\nfinal year\nAverate rate of\nsubsidty cut pa\nSouth West\nTrains\nStagecoach 7 £54.7m £40.3m £2m\nGreat Western Management 10 £53.2 £38.2 £2.1m\nInterCity East\nCoast\nSea Containers 7 £64.6m 0 £9.2m\nGatwick\nExpress\nNational\nExpress Group\n15 -£4.6m -£22.6m n/a\nNetwork South\nCentral\nCGEA 7 £85.3m £34.6m £7.2m\nMidland Main National\nExpress Group\n10 £16.5m -£10m n/a\nLondon,\nTilbury and\nSouthend\nPrism 15 £29.5m £11.2m £1.2m\nNote: Negative figures indicate a premium paid by the operator to OPRAF; Great Western final year\nsubsidy is for year seven\nThe National Audit Office is investigating the first two franchises. \n \n                                                                                                                                                            \n24 Local Transport Today 23.5.96 \"New hands on the controls - but where will the private sector take the\nrailways?\"\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nC. Opposition Parties' Policies\nThe Labour Party\nThe aim of the Labour Party is to \"encourage more intensive use of rail by both passengers\nand freight, on a system which is comfortable, affordable and safe, and which is fully\nintegrated both across the network and with other transport modes.\"25 It is not against the\ninvolvement of private capital in the railways and will encourage partnerships between public\nenterprise and the private industry to improve the transport system. It considers, however, that\nthe current privatised railway will cost more to run, has led to decreasing investment since\n1992/93 and a collapse in orders for rolling stock and will do nothing to encourage future\ninvestment.26 Furthermore the break up of the network has led to a costly internal market, the\nerosion of through ticketing and the undermining of train connections.\nThe Labour Party has spelt out its commitment to a \"publicly owned and publicly accountable\nrailway.\" At the 1995 Labour Party Conference Tony Blair said:27\n\"This nation needs a proper national integrated transport system that serves the\nneeds of the people and safeguards the environment. And we should sit down\nas a country and plan it. Not wait for the free-market to build it - but plan it\ntogether.\nNow let me make one thing clear. I don't give blank cheques in any area of\npolicy, including this. No matter what the pressures.\nBut to anyone thinking of grabbing our railways, built up over the years, so\nthey can make a quick profit as our network is broken up and sold off I say\nthis: There will be a publicly owned and publicly accountable railway system\nunder a Labour government.\nAnd we will save the hundreds of millions of pounds still being spent on\nselling our railways to upgrade our service and modernise our lines.\"\nThe policy regarding the franchises for the passenger services was set out recently by Brian\nWilson. He said that when Labour come to office there would be no extension of franchises\nwhich have been let and the franchising process would cease at once. He wrote:28\nWe will not break legally binding contracts which have been entered into. Neither will we come into gov-\nernment waving a chequebook and offering to buy them out. That would only succeed in guaranteeing\n                                                                                                                                                            \n25 Labour Party Consensus for change - Labour's transport strategy for the 21st century June 1996\n26 Labour Party press release 8.1.96\n27 3 October 1995 \n28 Guardian 12.12.95 \"Perils of riding Stagecoach\"\n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nthe franchisees a no-lose bet, at the expense of a substantial spending commitment. However, we will\nmost certainly enforce the terms of the franchises in a way which the Tories will not. To facilitate this\nprocess, the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising will be abolished, since it is an unnecessary piece of\nbureaucracy within an integrated railway.\nUntil the Railways Act can be amended, the Franchising Director will remain, but under the aegis of the\nBritish Railways Board. There will be no question of franchisees coming back to him either to obtain\nmore money or to achieve derogations on fares or the levels of service.\nAs we have told the potential franchisees, we will lay stress on the absolute priority of safety and on the\nneeds of passengers and staff. Since notice is being given in advice of our detailed approach, there will\nof course be no question of compensation if operators fail to meet these conditions, and pull out.\nThis approach represents a sensible balance between our political commitment to restoring an integrated\nrailway and the realities we will inherit. If any franchisee can live with these terms, then so be it. If they\ncannot, then the services will revert sooner than otherwise to the main railway network.\nIn Consensus for Change reference is made to the need for greater public accountability for\npublic subsidy. Train operating companies are dependent on high levels of public subsidy\nbecause of the high charges Railtrack sets for the use of the track, making it impossible for\nrail to compete with roads on an equal basis. Labour would therefore reorganise the subsidy\nregime and would ask the Rail Regulator to review the current arrangements. In Holland and\nSweden the railway subsidy is put into the infrastructure, so that train operating companies\nare profitable. A re-routing of the subsidy towards the infrastructure would create a greater\ntransparency, enable government to reach an agreement with Railtrack on the use of the\nsubsidy and would also reduce the marginal costs of enhancing rail use by passengers.\nThe Liberal Democrats\nThe Liberal Democrats published a policy paper, Transporting People, Tackling Pollution,29in\nwhich they proposed a smaller number of regional companies rather than the present 25\npassenger companies. These would be responsible for all aspects of service delivery in their\nregion including timetabling, signal control, station management and day to day track\nmaintenance. As far as the franchises were concerned it was the influence and control which\nwas important, not ownership. They propose to:\n• Seek to alter the scope and specification of franchises, by legislation if necessary, to\nachieve our wider objectives.\n• Design franchises to secure a steady growth in the proportion of passenger and\nfreight trips made by rail in line with nationally agreed targets. This would encourage\nfranchisees to invest in all aspects of the service.\n \n                                                                                                                                                            \n29 Liberal Democrats policy paper 15 September 1995\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\nII The Franchising Programme\nThis section of the paper sets out chronologically what has happened to the franchising\nprocess since the announcement in December 1994 of the pre-qualification bids for the first\neight companies. \n14 December 1994. The Franchising Director published details of the pre-qualification\nprocess for the first eight franchises to be let (rather more than the six\nannounced the previous year):30\n- Gatwick Express\n- Great Western\n- InterCity East Coast\n- LTS Rail\n- Midland Main Line\n- Network SouthCentral\n- ScotRail\n- South West Trains\nHe also let it be known that he would consider letting InterCity West Coast but as there were\nmajor problems associated with the work to be done on the track, he wanted to hear first if\nthere was any interest expressed.\n31 January 1995. Draft PSRs for Gatwick Express, Great Western, South West and LTS\nwere published for consultation, mainly with the consultative\ncommittees and the local authorities.\n37 organisations applied to pre-qualify for this first group and many applicants were interested\nin more than one franchise, taking the total number of applications to 160.

In December 1995\nChiltern was awarded a Chartermark for excellence in the provision of public services. Major\ninvestment in upgrading signalling and stations and in new rolling stock was completed in\n1992. Its primary source of passenger revenue is provided by routes serving the commuter\ntowns in the M40 corridor. As at 24 September 1995, Chiltern's rolling stock consisted of a\nmodern fleet of diesel multiple units, all of which were under five years old and equipped\nwith driver only operation.\nPassenger revenue for 1994/95 was £22 million and the company employs around 360 staff.\nVested 30.4.95\nDraft PSR issued 19.9.95; final PSR issued 22.1.96\nPQD invited 3.10.95; ITT issued 30.1.96\nSuccessful bidder announced 25.6.96\nNew service commenced 22.7.96\nThe passenger rail franchise to operate services between London Marylebone and Birmingham\n(Snow Hill), currently operated by The Chiltern Railway Co Ltd was awarded to M40 Trains\nLimited, a management buy out group with backing from 3i and John Laing.\nThe franchise has been let for a seven year term. M40 Trains has committed to operate at\nleast the current number of train services each year throughout the life of the franchise. In\naddition, it has committed to ordering 12 new 100 mph diesel multiple unit vehicles within\none month of the franchise commencement for deployment on new Marylebone-Birmingham\nexpress services. Together with committed infrastructure improvements, it is anticipated that\nthese services will achieve a Marylebone-Birmingham journey time of less than two hours.\nOther service and operational enhancements include:\n• additional, accelerated, services between Aylesbury and Marylebone via Amersham\nin both the peaks;\n• through services between Aylesbury and Marylebone via Amersham on Sundays;\n• additional services between Marylebone and Birmingham on Sundays;\n35\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/85\n• investment of £1 million in station improvements, including 300 additional car parking\nspaces, with CCTV at entrances to the expanded car parks and the installation at\nMarylebone of automatic ticket barriers;\n• feasibility studies for the redevelopment of High Wycombe station and for\ninfrastructure improvements at Haddenham & Thame Parkway station;\n• improvements to Passenger's Charter.\nM40 Trains will receive from the Franchising Director support, in current prices, of £16.5m\nin the first year declining to £2.9m in 2003.

The\nhub of CrossCountry's route network is Birmingham, with frequent services operating to\nManchester, Sheffield, Reading and Bristol. Some trains extend to Glasgow, Edinburgh and\nAberdeen in the North, and to Brighton, Bournemouth, Swansea and Penzance in the South\nand West. Within its route network, CrossCountry operates a number of long distance\nthrough trains, including services from Glasgow to Bournemouth, a distance of over 470\nmiles, and from Dundee to Penzance, a distance of over 700 miles.\nCrossCountry's route network serves over 100 stations. CrossCountry offers the opportunity\nto travel directly between a number of regional centres without the necessity of changing\ntrains, or stations, in London. Almost all of the rail network used by CrossCountry is also\nused by one or more passenger train operators. \nPassenger revenue to 31 March 1995 was £102 million.

          "Unemployment by Constituency\nJuly 1996\nResearch Paper 96/86\n14 August 1996\nOfficial monthly unemployment rates for parliamentary constituencies only exist for those few\nconstituencies which are self-contained labour markets. This paper presents up-to-date\nresidence-based unemployment rates not published elsewhere for all 651 constituencies in the\nUK, using figures for the number of unemployed claimants from the monthly count and data\nfor the economically active population from the 1991 Census of Population. \nIn May 1996 the Office for National Statistics moved to a 1991 ward base for the\nunemployment statistics. This means that for many constituencies it is no longer possible to\nmake direct comparisons with previously published data. As a result, this Paper no longer\nincludes a table on changes in the level of unemployment in recent years. Research Paper\n96/63 provides a guide to the methodology and to which constituencies are affected by the\nchange in the geographical base.\nJane Dyson\nEconomic Policy Alison Penman\n& Statistics Section Statistics Resource Unit\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n                                                                   \nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not published elsewhere. These use figures for the number of unemployed\nclaimants from the monthly count and figures for the number of people economically active\nderived from the 1991 Census of Population. \nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour, as they take no account of people's ability to seek work outside the constituency\nin which they live. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nthe Research Paper 96/63.\nThe data contained in this Paper are generally not comparable with figures published in this\nseries of Papers of this series prior to May 1996. This is because in May 1996 the ONS\nchanged the geographical basis of the monthly claimant count. Previously, the monthly\nfigures have related to parliamentary constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1981 wards.\nFrom the April 1996 figures onwards, data are based on constituencies defined in terms of\nfrozen 1991 wards. Whilst figures for January, February and March 1996 were re-released\non the new basis, back-runs of figures for dates prior to 1996 will not be published. For\nmany constituencies therefore, there will be a discontinuity in the figures at the end of 1995.\nFor this reason it is no longer possible to produce tables showing the change in the number\nof claimants 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ago. \nNotes to tables:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The\nfollowing abbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\nIND Independent\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/86\n2. The data from the 1991 Census of Population used for the denominators in calculating\nresidence-based unemployment rates were obtained from the dataset known as the\nLocal Base Statistics. In the case of the Censuses for England and Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland, the raw data relate to areas known as \"Enumeration Districts\".\nThese data are first aggregated into electoral wards and then wards are aggregated to\nform constituency totals. In Scotland the raw data relate to \"Output Areas\". These\nfigures are not available at a ward level but are aggregated directly into higher level\ngeographical areas such as constituencies and districts.\nThere is inevitably a time-lag between changes in electoral ward boundaries being\nincorporated into parliamentary constituencies. This means that wards are not always\ncoterminous with constituencies. Where this is the case, wards have been best-fitted\nto constituencies on the basis of the constituency where the majority of the population\nare thought to live. Those constituencies where such a process has been employed are\ndenoted \"***\" in all the tables in this paper.\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/86\n       II   Residence-based unemployment rates by parliamentary constituency, July 1996\n             United Kingdom constituencies\n                                                 A.

Five years on from Rio, in June 1997 the UN\nGeneral Assembly will convene a special session 'Earth Summit II', to review Agenda 21's\nprogress. \nA UN Commission on Sustainable Development was established to help implement Agenda\n21 but seems recently to have lost its way. However, local authorities are currently\nimplementing Local Agenda 21s with vigour. The UK has produced its National Strategy for\nSustainable Development and published a set of Indicators for Sustainable Development. It\nhas also established a high level Government Advisory Panel on Sustainable Development\nwhich has suggested radical changes to some Government policies. A multi-sectoral Round\nTable on Sustainable Development and a citizen's awareness programme 'Going for Green'\nhave also been created. \n \nMovement towards sustainability has to be reconciled with drives towards deregulation and\neconomic growth, which are even harder to deny in developing countries than in the\nindustrialised world. The EC's Fifth Environmental Action programme Towards Sustainability\nhas not made the desired progress, and its mid-term review by the Commission has resulted\nin an interim kick-start action plan. \nThe Government has undertaken to apply environmental appraisals to all policy decisions but\nthere is little evidence of this being done. While the UK will meet carbon dioxide emission\ntargets under the climate change convention and takes a lead in international fora on this\nissue, this can be attributed more to the recession and a switch from coal to gas power\ngeneration than to increased energy efficiency. The Lords Select Committee and the Round\nTable on Sustainable Development have been critical of some aspects of the Government's\nenergy policy. \nAgainst the backdrop of a growing anti-roads movement, the Round Table seems to have\nadopted transport policy as one of its key concerns. The UK has introduced a landfill levy\nas its first major environmental tax, but remains strongly opposed as ever to any EU carbon\ntax. This is despite the calls of the Government Panel for a fundamental shift in taxation\nfrom capital, labour and income to resources, including energy. \n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nI. Introduction\n'Sustainable development' is a notoriously nebulous concept. Even the Secretary of State for\nthe Environment John Gummer, while having no reservations about the idea, has said that he\nhas never felt comfortable with the term1. First introduced by the 1987 Brundtland\nCommission2, 'sustainable development' is\n'Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future\ngenerations to meet their own needs'3. \nThe 1992 Rio Earth Summit took sustainable development as one of its central themes, and\nproduced a lengthy 'sustainable action plan', with no legal status, called Agenda 21. Putting\nAgenda 21 into action will be vastly difficult, even more so than implementing the relatively\nprescriptive and limited Conventions which also emerged from Rio, on Biodiversity and on\nClimate Change. \nRio established a UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) to help implement\nAgenda 21 and the CSD has so far held four sessions; its fifth will take place in February-\nMarch 1997, in advance of the UN General Assembly's Special Session in June 1997 which\nwill perform a five-year review of Agenda 214. As a crucial part of the process, local\nauthorities at home and abroad are currently implementing Local Agenda 21s. \nThe UK, like other countries which signed Agenda 21, has produced its National Strategy\nfor Sustainable Development5, and has been one of the first countries to publish a set of\nIndicators for Sustainable Development which should provide some measures of progress6.\nOther UK initiatives have included the setting up of the high level Government Advisory\nPanel on Sustainable Development chaired by Sir Crispin Tickell. The First Report of the\nPanel7 was seen as suggesting radical changes to some Government policies8. In addition, the\nGovernment has established the multi-sectoral Round Table on Sustainable Development, the\ncitizen's awareness programme 'Going for Green', and has recently published the sixth in the\nThis Common Inheritance environmental white paper series9. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n1This Common Inheritance UK Annual Report 1995 Cm 2822 March 1995\n2Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future 1987\n3Cm 2426  Sustainable development; the UK strategy 1994 p. 27\n4www.iisd.ca/linkages/csd/csd1996\n5Cm 2426  Sustainable development; the UK strategy 1994 \n6Indicators of Sustainable Development for the United Kingdom DoE/Government Statistical Service March 1996\n7British Government Panel on Sustainable Development First Report, DoE January 1995, DEP/3 1013\n8for instance, Observer 22 January 1995 'Go for green tax, says Major's team'\n9UK Annual Report 1996 Reporting on the UK's Sustainable Strategy of 1994 (Including the Environmental\nStrategy of 1990) Cm 3188 March 1996\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\n \nYet movement towards sustainability has to be reconciled with drives towards deregulation\nand also economic growth, which are even harder to deny in developing countries than in the\nindustrialised world. The EC's Fifth Environmental Action programme is called Towards\nSustainability, but this has not made the desired progress, and its mid-term review by the\nCommission has resulted in an interim action plan to identify and act on priorities10. \nIn the UK, the Government has undertaken to apply environmental appraisals to policy\ndecisions in all Departments, but there is little evidence of this being done (see p.29). While\nthe UK is on course to meet carbon dioxide emission targets under the climate change\nconvention and has taken a lead in international fora on this issue, this can be attributed more\nto the recession and a switch from coal to gas power generation rather than increased energy\nefficiency. The Lords Select Committee and the Round Table on Sustainable Development\nhave been critical of some aspects of the Government's energy policy in this regard. \nA number of highly publicised cases have highlighted the loss of sites of nature conservation\nvalue to road building schemes, and there is a growing anti-roads movement in the UK; the\nRound Table seems to have adopted transport policy as one of its key concerns. The UK has\nintroduced a landfill levy to discourage waste from going to landfill, as its first major\nenvironmental tax, but remains strongly opposed as ever to any EU carbon tax. This is\ndespite the calls of the Government Panel on sustainable development for a fundamental shift\nin taxation from capital, labour and income to resources, including energy. \nII. Global Action\nA. The Brundtland report and 'sustainable development'\nThe UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED; the Earth Summit) held in\nRio in 1992 differed crucially from earlier UN environment conferences, such as Stockholm\nin 1972, by the inclusion of the word 'Development'. Since Stockholm, when the\nindustrialised countries had first acknowledged they had to curb their effects on the\nenvironment, the gap between the industrialised and undeveloped nations had widened, the\neffects of Third World Debt were being appreciated, and the poorer countries were insisting\nthat they had to be allowed to grow. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n10ENDS Report 253 February 1996 'Brussels bid to revive flagging environmental programme' pp.24-27\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nThis resulted in the international Brundtland Commission11 being established to investigate\nthe links between environmental destruction and development. It concluded that a decline\nin quality of life was being caused and the only way to stop this was to adopt sustainable\ndevelopment and start living from 'nature's income rather than its capital account'. The Lords\nSelect Committee on Sustainable Development offer a range of definitions of 'sustainable\ndevelopment', supplied by their witnesses12, but that very different meanings are attached to\nsustainable development by industrialised and non-industrialised countries is clear13;\n'For wealthy nations, sustainable development means policies concerning such issues as\nrecycling, energy efficiency, conservation, rehabilitation of damaged landscapes. For the poor\nnations it means policies for equity, fairness, respect of the law, redistribution of wealth and\nwealth creation'. \nAlthough the right to develop is meant to be encompassed in sustainable development this is\nclearly not always evident to developing counties, who see environmental protection as a\nhinderance to their growth. During the preparatory meetings (PrepComs) for the recent UN\nHabitat II conference (see section II.E), some members of the G77 proposed replacing the\nwords 'sustainable development' with 'sustained economic growth'. Critics say that some of\nthe G77 nations supporting such moves are oil-exporters and not always the poorest nations,\nbut point out that14 \n'The right to develop is a key part of Agenda 21 and sustainable development. If\nsustainability has come to be seen as being environmentalism in another guise, then that is\npartly the fault of Western nations, who have paid much less attention to the chapters in\nAgenda 21 on poverty, shelter and livelihoods.'\nSustainable development offers the promise of direct benefits for developed nations such as\nan increase in quality of life, even if a somewhat Utopian view is sometimes advanced15;\n'For hundred of years we had accepted the growth of pollution and only when it became\nutterly intolerable did we take effective action against it. Now we are seeing how much it has\ndeprived us. \n'As the fish come back to our rivers and the wild flowers to the unsprayed margins of more\nand more of our fields, we begin to learn just how much we have lost. Like a former smoker\nrecovering his sense of smell, we have begun to rediscover a richness in the world which we\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n11World Commission on Environment and Development\n12Report from the Select Committee on Sustainable Development Volume I-Report.

Although the UK\nhad originally opposed the establishment of the Brundtland Commission, Margaret Thatcher\ncame out in support of the need for the UN to further address environmental issues, at a time\nwhen the extent of man-made damage to the stratospheric ozone layer was becoming clear. \n \nBy the end of 1988 over 50 world leaders, including Mitterand, Gandhi and Gorbachev had\ncome out in favour of the Commission's conclusions and were calling for a UN event to act\non these. This has been referred to as the 'environmental beauty contest of world leaders'16,\nbut it resulted in the landmark conference at Rio, which was attended by 178 states17. \nB. Agenda 21\nAgenda 21 is the 'sustainable action plan for the 21st century', a long negotiated document\nwhich was adopted in Rio. It was signed by 153 countries18, but it is not legally binding.\nIn fact its nature, being a global action plan, or guidance document, is unusual among\ninternational agreements, and unlike the biodiversity and climate change conventions, it does\nnot need to be ratified. \nAgenda 21 is nothing if not comprehensive. Its 40 chapters cover human issues such as\npoverty, consumption patterns, demography, human health and settlement, and more\nconventional environmental issues such as protecting the atmosphere, forests and fragile\necosystems, seas, freshwaters and biodiversity. The management of wastes, biotechnology\nand land resources are included, as are the roles of groups such as women, NGOs, indigenous\npeoples, farmers, businesses and scientists. A final group of chapters concern the instruments\nand institutions needed for change. \nIn many cases Local Agenda 21s will have more relevance to individuals than the document\nwhich emerged from Rio. These are presently being drawn up and implemented, and are\ndiscussed in section III. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n16\n'From Stockholm to Rio' Richard Sandbrook, in Earth Summit 1992 (abridged version of Agenda 21)\n17Report from the Select Committee on Sustainable Development Volume I-Report.  HL Paper 72, Session 1994-5\n21 June 1995\n18source DoE \n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nC. UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD)\nChapter 38 ('International institutional arrangements') of Agenda 21 said that a high-level\nCommission on Sustainable Development, CSD, reporting to the General Assembly through\nthe UN Economic and Social Council ECOSOC, should be established to ensure an effective\nfollow-up to Rio, rationalise the international decision making process, and monitor progress\nin Agenda 21 implementation regionally, nationally and internationally. \nNot only was the CSD established following Rio, but unexpectedly generous NGO access to\nit was granted, leading one NGO which lobbied for its establishment to acknowledge that 'we\nare in the unusual position where governments have neither sold out nor backpedalled'.\nReservations have been voiced concerning the CSD's size and resources however19 (it has a\n'very small staff'20), and the CSD has clearly been feeling its way regarding its remit and\nfocus; it is not clear that it has even yet found its true rôle. \nThe CSD was established in February 1993 by ECOSOC and it has 53 member nations, who\nhave agreed to furnish it with reports on their progress in implementing the Rio agreements.\nThe CSD will be able to gather its own data as well as relying on government reports, and\nit will also make recommendations for the 1997 General Assembly review of Agenda 21.\nThe CSD also aims to improve the links between the UN and the World's financial\ninstitutions such as the GEF, IMF and World Bank. Its first meeting was in New York on\nJune 1993 when Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia was elected its first chair and\ncommented21:\n'the Commission comes into existence as arguably the main tangible accomplishment of the\nRio summit, an inter-governmental machinery to monitor the implementation of Rio'. \nThe CSD meets approximately annually and there is a high-level ministerial meeting which\nprecedes each session; at its second meeting (CSD-2) Klaus Töpfler (the German Environment\nMinister) was chair. However, at CSD-2 concerns were voiced for the first time about a need\nto move from rhetoric to action, and the difficulty of the CSD doing this without changing\nits format and without extra funding from Official Development Assistance. One step made\nat CSD-2 was the establishment of 'ad-hoc open-ended working groups' on sectoral issues\nsuch as forests, finance, biodiversity and desertification22. While applauding the chairmen of\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n19ENDS Report 218, March 1993 'New UN bodies to monitor progress on Earth Summit accords' pp.41-42\n20The UN CSD Three Years Since the Rio Summit A UNED-UK Report.

I have never heard so many\nplatitudes read out'. \nThe third meeting of the CSD in April 1995 chaired by Henrique Cavalcanti (Brazil) had a\nrevised format of numerous panel discussions. The first country reports on national\nimplementation of Agenda 21 were presented24, including one from the UK25, and one day\nwas devoted to discussing different national experiences. Local authority experiences in\nimplementing Agenda 21 were similarly discussed on another day. CSD-3 established an ad\nhoc CSD intergovernmental panel on forests (IPF). \nThe fourth session of the CSD (CSD-4) was held in Spring 1996 and considered further\ncountry reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 and a methodology for the adoption of\n'sustainable development indicators' (see section IV.A), to help the CSD chart precisely the\nprogress made since Rio26. It began considering preparations for the General Assembly's\nfive-year review of Agenda 21 and beyond, and this issue seemed to eclipse other concerns.\nSome reservations about progress were voiced; one delegate stated that CSD-4 lacked the\nsense of urgency of past years and some observers said that some sectoral issue debates\n(oceans and atmosphere) were simply restating those that had taken place in other fora. \nRegarding the CSD's future, most delegates agreed that the body should continue, but should\nnot simply conduct further reviews of Agenda 21. Generally, the feeling seems to be that the\nCSD should focus its work on either certain sectors (such as oceans) or on pressing issues\n(such as poverty or megacities) which require international co-operation and where the CSD\ncan provide an impetus for action27. How exactly this should be done, or how these issues\nshould be chosen, has not been decided28. \nD.

This five-year review, 'Earth Summit II'\nis now expected to convene from 9-13 June 1997. \nIn the short term then, the CSD will now be focusing on Earth Summit II. The planned\nFebruary 1997 CSD 'ad hoc open ended working group meeting' will devote itself to\npreparing for the 1997 UN Special Assembly consideration of Agenda 21; in UN jargon, it\nwill be PrepCom I for the Special Assembly meeting. The next CSD meeting proper, CSD-5,\nwill take place from 7-25 April 1997 in New York and will be PrepCom II. \nFive years on from Rio, 1997 will be a landmark year, with not only Earth Summit II taking\nplace, but important meetings for the biodiversity and climate change conventions which were\nthe legal instruments agreed at Rio. In July 1996 the parties to the climate change convention\nmet in Geneva29 to review progress since the Berlin meeting, but while the USA came out\nunexpectedly in favour of emissions limits, the conference in essence deferred making\ncommitments and taking decisions until its next meeting which will take place in Kyoto in\nDecember 199730. Also in 1997 the biodiversity convention parties, which will have their\nthird meeting in Buenos Aires from 4-15 November 1996, will seek to finalise their biosafety\nprotocol31. A detailed consideration of the these two conventions is beyond the scope of this\npaper (but please see, for example, the Library Research Papers listed on the back of this\npaper). \nThe CSD and UN have evidently come to the belated conclusion, confirmed by Habitat II\n(below) that concrete information on the success of different policies, and comparisons of\npractical experiences in different countries is one of the best ways of making progress in the\nintangible area of sustainable development32. A comprehensive report on the overall progress\nsince Rio will be prepared for consideration at PrepCom II/CSD-5, to include\nrecommendations for future actions and priorities.

Habitat II\nIn June 1996 in Istanbul the UN held its last major summit this century, the second\nConference on Human Settlements, Habitat II. (Habitat I took place in Vancouver in 1976.)\nBetween now and the end of the century, the human race will become an urban species; one\nin which over 50% of its members live in towns and cities. Worldwide, an area of\ncountryside the size of Bristol is urbanised every year, and cities are growing by one million\npeople per week; at least 600 million people live in shanty shelters in developing world\ncities34. \nHabitat II seems not to have been an unqualified success, and reportedly made a mistake in\nhaving two aims35, which were36;\n the right of adequate shelter for all and\n creating sustainable human settlements. \nIt has been said that if it had settled on the latter this would have encompassed the former\nand perhaps seen the realisation of Agenda 21 at a local level, but as it chose not to, much\ntime was spent 'educating Housing Ministers about sustainable development'37. Nevertheless,\nthe conference gave unprecedented rights of formal access for NGOs to the UN, there was\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n34City Summit News UNED-UK April 1996\n35\n 'Istanbul- a new deal' Felix Dodds in Habitat II supplement to Connections UNED-UK Aug-Oct 1996\n36Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements, Istanbul 14 June 1996\n37\n 'Istanbul- a new deal' Felix Dodds in Habitat II supplement to Connections UNED-UK Aug-Oct 1996\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nconsiderable input from local authorities, and governments accepted that implementation of\nHabitat II aims should link in with existing processes, notably Local Agenda 21s (see section\nIII). \nThe UK Government was praised for its supportive attitude to Habitat II and local authority\ninvolvement38. The Commission on Human Settlements will meet in Spring 1997 to review\nthe outcome of Habitat II and to agree priorities for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda\n(the Global Plan of Action analogous to Agenda 21). \nHopefully the view of one observer will prove correct39;\n'We shall have a much clearer idea how the outcomes from Istanbul, Cairo, Beijing,\nCopenhagen and Rio fit together and who is in charge of what after the Earth Summit II in\nJune 1997.' \nIII. Local Agenda 21\nClearly the implementation of Agenda 21 will be a monumental task. Although countries will\ndevelop their own National Agenda 21s, further down the scale it is generally agreed that\n'Local Agenda 21s' (LA21s) will really be needed to put the action plan into practice. Much\nof Agenda 21 refers to the need for local authority action, and Chapter 28 specifically urged\nlocal authorities to adopt Local Agenda 21s by 1996. \nThe organisation overseeing the development of LA21s in the UK is the Local Government\nManagement Board (LGMB). This has asked for reports from each local authority by\nDecember 1996 on progress in implementing LA21s so that it can prepare a report for the\nCSD/General Assembly review of Agenda 21 in 199740. \nThe concept seems to have been adopted with enthusiasm by UK local authorities, which is\nall the more remarkable in a climate of local government re-organisation; indeed, it is felt by\nsome that the application of LA21 in Scotland at least has suffered because of this41. National\nLA21 co-ordinators met recently in Norway and discovered significant variations in takeup\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n38The Scotsman 6 June 1996 Councils: Supporting role wins loud applause\n39\n 'Istanbul- a new deal' Felix Dodds in supplement to Connections UNED-UK Aug-Oct 1996\n40Connections Feb-April 1996 UNED-UK pp.18-19\n41Scotsman 1 April 1996 Race against time to meet green reforms deadline - Authorities have just months to\nproduce blueprint for change at heart of decision-making\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nthroughout Europe; from 100% in Sweden to 10% in Germany, 30% in Italy and over 60%\nin the UK and Denmark42. \nThe most recent survey by the LGMB has indicated that of those authorities who responded,\n90.6% are undertaking a Local Agenda 21 process43. An earlier LGMB survey showed that\n71% of 303 local authorities surveyed were committed to taking part in the Local Agenda 21\nprocess. The LGMB's environmental adviser has talked of one Local Agenda 21 initiative\nbeing launched every week, and of an 'enthusiasm and buzz'. Nearly half of local authorities\nhave carried out an internal environmental audit, although only 37% have integrated\nsustainable development into their corporate strategies. The LGMB feel that the councils that\nhave made most progress are those which are less bureaucratic and have made 'big cultural\nchanges to make them more open and flexible'44. \nThe boxes on the next two pages provide some examples of specific LA21 programmes.\nFurther case studies, from the UK and around the world, are quoted in the report which\nemerged from the NGO/local authority 'Global Forum' held in Manchester in 199445. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n42Connections, Aug-Oct 1996 UNED-UK, 'Implementation of LA21 in Europe' p. 15\n43Connections, Aug-Oct 1996 UNED-UK, 'LA21 survey results' p. 15\n44for example, Daily Telegraph 11 March 1995 Hard-headed locals bring summitspeak down to earth, and The\nIndependent 9 March 1995 Down-to-earth plans to save the planet\n45First Steps Local Agenda 21 in practice Municipal Strategies for Sustainability as presented to the Global\nForum Manchester 1994 Manchester City Council HMSO 1994\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\n    Leicester... the only UK city represented at the Rio conference [has a] Blueprint for Leicester... the\ncrux of Leicester's initiative was a public consultation exercise to involve local residents. Says Councillor\nMary Draycott: 'Traffic needs to be reduced in the city centre - but shop owners might not be very\nsupportive if they think this will damage the city centre economy.' Involving people in planning allays\nsuch fears, she says. Even in Leicester the team battled apathy.... \n   As a big local employer, the council itself has re-examined its internal organisation for environmentally\nfriendly policies - staff transport, including a bike mileage allowance, energy efficient offices and 'green\npurchasing'. Moreover, all council reports and policy discussions must detail 'environmental implications'\nalongside financial, equal opportunities and other consequences... Cost, in Leicester as elsewhere, remains\na barrier... 'Some authorities say we have no money - why should we do this?... But it is not about new\nmoney - it is about spending existing money in different ways'.\n   Leicester councillors say the blueprint does not call for higher spending. Rather, they say the strategy\ntakes a broader and longer-term view of the 'payback period' over which environmental initiatives save\nmoney. Critics claim Leicester has little concrete to show for the effort. Councillors reply that the city\nhas recently launched a new pilot recycling scheme which collects materials such as plastics and cans\nfrom special doorway bins just like ordinary rubbish. All told, the cost exceeds the returns, but this has\nto be set against the cost of landfilling waste, with a further £7 per tonne new landfill tax planned.\n...Moreover, Leicester can point to the success of home energy grants for 'fuel poor' local\nhome-owners...Between April 1994 and August 1995 the council made 624 grants, mainly to owners of\nVictorian terraces, saving residents £177,000 a year in fuel costs. The home energy grants - to help the\npoor and old keep warm - also reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 2,295 tonnes a year. [Financial\nTimes 31 January 1996]\n   In Edinburgh ... Green teams have been formed at all levels of the council... with energy conservation,\nwaste management and recycling, protection of green spaces policies. But the radical element lies in their\nintegration with the council's economic development plan. Environmental businesses are encouraged to\nmove to the city; its principal hotels have all signed up to an environmental charter; advice on\nenvironmental issues is made available to all small and medium-sized companies. [Daily Telegraph 11\nMarch 1995]\n    In Merton ... 27 [local sustainable development] indicators were selected after a straw poll of 500\nresidents and advice from a mixed group drawn from the commercial, voluntary and public sectors, as\nwell as individual participants. Their input meant that, in addition to indicators suggested by consultants,\nsuch as air pollution, river water quality, and freshwater pond life, eight were contributed directly from\nthe community. These included: decay levels in children's teeth, as an indicator of health, water quality\nand health education; road accidents, which together with fears over personal safety were reinforcing a\ntrend for parents to drive children to school; and the number of people who live and work in the borough,\nan indicator of how far the community is economically self-supporting. Merton's indicators will play a\nvital role in the action plan it is to draw up [in 1996].

Researchers recommend that new ways of consulting the public on an\nopen-ended basis need to be found, and the council must develop better listening mechanisms. [The\nIndependent 9 March 1995]\n   At Reading Council... a similar initiative had more positive results. Run with the Worldwide Fund for\nNature and a special community expert, the scheme avoided jargon like 'sustainable', replacing it with\n'Globe - Go Local on a Better Environment'. ... The task was to reach out to ... neighbourhood groups\nsuch as tenant and resident associations and parent/teacher group members, and broadening their view,\nencouraging them to voice concerns on wider environmental issues... The confidence of everyone\ninvolved, officers, councillors and residents, had to be nurtured.

Its Step by Step Guide to LA21 has, it feels, provided a\nreal catalyst for action and it has been 'amazed' at the interest and enthusiasm generated47. \nThe Government48 considers that LAs are in a good position to make a contribution to\nsustainable development because they can develop a strategic approach, through corporate\nprocesses, on a wide range of functions which impact on the environment.

UK Government Action\nThe UK produced its strategy for implementing Agenda 21, Sustainable Development The UK\nStrategy in January 199452 (the 'UK Strategy'), and this contained commitments to a number\nof measures. It was accompanied by the UK strategies on biodiversity53, climate change54 and\nforestry55. A detailed consideration of these is beyond the scope of this paper, but please see\nfor instance the Library Research Papers listed on the back of this paper. \nA. Sustainable development indicators and targets\n \nThe UK Strategy gave an undertaking to produce preliminary sustainable development\nindicators for the UK within two years. Indicators of Sustainable Development for the United\nKingdom56 was published just outside this deadline57, in time for CSD-458. Announcing their\npublication, John Gummer said59;\n'If we are to improve our policies, we need to monitor how effective they are. We already\ncollect and publish a mass of environmental information, and a comprehensive range of\neconomic and social statistics. The challenge somehow is to condense this very considerable\namount of information into a limited number of key indicators, so that we can see how well\nwe are doing overall, and where we need to make further progress. \n'...Defining what we mean by sustainable development is not easy. Achieving sustainable\ndevelopment presents a considerable challenge. I hope that these indicators will be useful in\ninforming us about our progress, and stimulating us to greater efforts.'\nThe preliminary set of 118 indicators, within 21 so-called 'families' of issues (such as the\neconomy, transport use, energy, land use, climate change, freshwater quality and wildlife\nand habitats) were selected by an interdepartmental Working Group and seem reasonable\nchoices. For example, in the family 'Acid Deposition' are three indicators; critical load\nexceedences in soils and freshwaters, power station sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides\nemissions, and nitrogen oxides emissions from road transport. The 'Wildlife and Habitats'\nfamily includes indicators such as native species at risk, breeding birds, lakes and ponds,\nspecies diversity in several key habitats, and mammal populations. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n52Cm 2426\n53Biodiversity The UK Action Plan Cm 2428\n54Climate Change The UK Programme Cm 2427\n55Sustainable Forestry The UK Programme Cm 2429\n56\n DoE and the Government Statistical Service March 1996\n57DoE Press Notice 105 12 March 1996 'Sustainable development indicators show the way forward'\n58DoE Press Notice 106 12 March 1996 'Indicators of sustainable development for the UK'\n59DoE Press Notice 105 12 March 1996 'Sustainable development indicators show the way forward'\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nFor example, the DoE gives the following summary of the indicators for 'Transport Use'60;\n'Growth in people's income has allowed them to travel more. Since 1970 the amount of car\ntravel has almost doubled to an average of 6,500 miles per person per year, while travel on\nother road passenger vehicles, mainly buses and coaches, has reduced by a quarter to less than\n600 miles per year. Rail travel has remained broadly unchanged at around 400 miles per year.\nExcept for journeys of up to one mile in length, where walking is the most common mode,\nthe car has increasingly dominated, even for short trips. Only 2 per cent of journeys up to five\nmiles long are made by bicycle, compared with 4 per cent twenty years ago. Since 1974, the\nreal price of rail and bus fares has increased faster than the 50 per cent growth in real\ndisposable incomes. The real cost of motoring has fallen, and car travel is therefore much\nmore affordable than it was twenty years ago.\n'Although amounts of freight transported have not increased greatly over the last twenty years,\nthe kinds of freight carried have changed with the decline of heavy industries, and the\ndistances over which it is carried have increased; 95 per cent of land-based freight is now\ncarried by road.'\nThe report points out that few indicators will fulfil all the criteria for an ideal indicator; one\nwhich, for example, is simple and easy to interpret may not be scientifically robust. Some\nindicators have been included to hold interest and meaning for certain groups such as farmers\nand householders, and to give these groups some idea of the direct effect of their activities\non the environment. The indicators are also national and as such present a dilemma; while\nthey really need to be presented as per household or per individual business or site, so as to\nbe meaningful to the individual, such extrapolations are not always valid and local\ncircumstances vary. It is hoped that in time core sets of local and national indicators will\nemerge, permitting true comparisons61. \nThese indicators are then very much a preliminary set which will be adapted over time to\nmake them more useful in telling us about sustainable development. In most cases the\nindicators cover trends over the past 20-25 years. They will be updated on a regular basis,\nprobably every two years62. \nThe Government is careful to stress the limitations of its indicators, which it sees as\nsimplifications of reality, and not to extrapolate them towards targets. Yet of course there has\nbeen pressure for targets to be set in several areas of policy. A compromise approach has\nbeen reached, whereby the Government has decided to adopt 'indicative targets', rather than\nabsolute or 'imperative' targets, in several areas, such as in the Government response to the\nUK Steering Group Report on Biodiversity63. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n60DoE Press Notice 106 12 March 1996 Indicators of sustainable development for the UK\n61Indicators of sustainable development for the UK DoE and Government Statistical Service March 1996 p. 11\n62HC Deb 20 February 1996 c84w\n63Cm 3260, May 1996\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nWhile the voluntary sector (in Biodiversity Challenge) initially called for the setting of firm\ntargets, the Government's view is that the unpredictability of the natural environment makes\nthis unrealistic64,65. Factors such as climate change and the common agricultural policy could\ncome into it, and not only the Government but landowners, individuals and NGOs will have\nto take responsibility. According to the DoE the NGOs have been generally supportive of\nthe Government's response to the steering group report, see the realities of the situation, wish\nto foster co-operation with the DoE, and are happy that the Government has gone for the\nchallenging targets set, albeit not as mandatory ones. \nThe Lords Select Committee on Sustainable Development was the original source of the idea\nof 'indicative targets'; the Committee recognised that setting targets was the way forward but\nalso appreciated the difficulties of doing this. It concluded that66\n'Notwithstanding our enthusiasm for targets, the reluctance of some Government Departments\nto set them presumably stems from their lack of control over the outcome and also a tendency\nfor targets to move from the indicative to the imperative. The latter would be relatively few\nin number whereas indicative targets form an essential part of the policy implementation\nprocess'. \nB. Government Advisory Panel on Sustainable Development\nLaunching the UK's Strategy the Prime Minister announced67;\n'I am appointing a Panel of people of great expertise on environmental, scientific and business\nmatters to advise the Government on future developments.'\nThe Government Panel on Sustainable Development is indeed high level. Its members are;\n• Sir Crispin Tickell GCMG KCVO (Convener)\n• Lord Alexander of Weedon QC\n• Sir John Houghton CBE FRS \n• Dr Anne McLaren DBE FRS \n• The Earl of Selborne KBE FRS\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n64ibid, para.20, p.4\n65source; DoE Wildlife Division\n66Volume I- Report Session 1994-5 HL Paper 72, 21 June 1995 para 3.63\n67Cm 2426 January 1994\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nThe Panel meets formally four or five times a year, keeps in contact with Members of the\nCabinet and with officials, and commissions reports from Government departments. It has\nnow produced two annual reports, which tend to focus on four policy issues in depth and\nconsider several other areas in less detail. \nThe Panel's first report68 considered environmental pricing and education, fish stocks and\nozone depletion as its main themes. It was seen as being critical of some Government and\nEU policies. The Panel recommended that the Government should give higher priority to the\ndefinition of environmental objectives and targets and to how it intended to meet them.\nRegarding fisheries, the Government should 'act rather than react' to events to promote long-\nterm policies for fisheries conservation. \nIn its second report69 the Panel continued to advocate a move towards the use of taxes on\nresources including energy rather than labour and income, and welcomed the (then proposed)\nlandfill tax and environmental trusts. It looked forward to the Government's promised\nenvironmental indicators but noted that commitment to setting targets had been patchy.\nFisheries continued to be a combustible issue and fundamental problems remained unchanged;\nwhile welcoming the international workshop organised by the Government, the Panel still\nwanted to see an Intergovernmental Panel on the Oceans (comparable to the hugely\ninfluential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) established. \nThe new issues which the Panel addressed in its second report were environmental\naccounting, biotechnology, forestry and the disposal of radioactive waste. The Panel wants\nthe Government to give higher priority to the development of accounts which include not only\neconomic, but also social and environmental change. (Environmental accounting is however\nan issue which has already been raised by the EU; environmentally adjusted national accounts\nshould be available now on a pilot basis, with a view to formal adoption by the year 2000.\nA Communication has been issued by the European Commission, seeking inter alia to\ndeveloping pricing methods in the assessment of environmental damage, as part of this drive\ntowards 'green auditing'70.) \nRegarding biotechnology, the Panel urges caution; it wants a international protocol on\ngenetically modified organism (GMO) handling and use, and for the Government to consider\nemergency procedures, liability and impact appraisals for the release of GMOs. In its\nresponse71 the Government highlighted the potential benefits of GMOs and outlined the\nconsiderable existing controls. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n68British Government Panel on Sustainable Development First Report, DoE January 1995\n69British Government Panel on Sustainable Development Second Report, DoE January 1996\n70Directions for the EU on Environmental Indicators and Green national Accounting - the integration of\nenvironmental and economic information systems.

It notes that new planting cannot replace ancient woodlands, which\nshould be fully protected. The Government says it shares these concerns. Regarding nuclear\nwaste, the Panel laments the Government leaving to other counties research into several\naspects of disposal (it plans to research only into high level disposal); the Government's\nresponse is that international co-operation should obviate the need for duplication in research.\n The Panel's final recommendation in its second report was that the public should be given\nmore information in general about nuclear power. \nThe Scottish Advisory Group on Sustainable Development provides advice in confidence to\nScottish Ministers on building sustainable development into all policies, and it has around a\ndozen members drawn from business, the voluntary sector, natural heritage organisations and\nlocal authorities72. In an Adjournment Debate in January 1996 Cynog Dafis said that Plaid\nCymru found it offensive that no special body on sustainable development had been\nestablished for Wales. Guidance was also needed from the Welsh Office to local authorities\nso that an all-Wales Agenda 21 could evolve. Gwilym Jones pointed out that there were\nWelsh representatives on the Round Table and Government Panel, and that a Welsh version\nof Going for Green would also be launched73. \nC. Round Table \nMore so than the Government Panel, the Round Table on Sustainable Development resembles\nthe national bodies set up by over 100 countries since Rio to advise on sustainable\ndevelopment. Whereas the Panel concentrates on giving independent advice to Government,\nthe Round Table is designed to bring together people with different interests to reach a\nconsensus and its roughly thirty-strong membership includes representatives of central and\nlocal government, business, environmental organisations and other sectors of the community.\nJohn Gummer and Professor Sir Richard Southwood co-chair the Round Table and the chairs\nof the Government Panel, of Going for Green and of the Scottish Advisory Group on\nSustainable Development are the three ex officio members. The Secretary of State's presence\non the Round Table (in plenary sessions; most reports are produced by sub-groups with expert\nadvisors where appropriate, but represent the entire Round Table's view) does not guarantee\nGovernment endorsement of all its conclusions74. \nThe Round Table started work in January 1995 and produced three initial reports a year later,\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n72Scottish Office press notice 2 July/1073/96 Minister announces new members for sustainable development\nadvisory group. \n73HC Deb 31 January 1996 cc966-974\n74UK Round Table on Sustainable Development Freight Transport January 1996\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\non ecomanagement and audit, freight transport and 'the domestic energy market 1998 and\nbeyond'75. For example, the report on freight transport recommended stricter enforcement of\nexisting legislation (vehicle check sites, impoundment of unlicensed vehicles, higher fines\nfrom Magistrates for overloading, road worthiness and maintenance offences), differential\nrates of tax for fuels and vehicles according to environmental-friendliness, and good practice\non route scheduling, load sharing and operating times. The co-chair, Sir Richard Southwood,\nhas said that Round Table has tried to \n 'identify particular and defined aspects where its recommendations might aid progress towards\nsustainability. On their own, many of these steps would be modest; but cumulatively, their\nimpact could be significant'.\nThe Round Table invited comments on its three reports before their full texts were included\nin its first Annual Report published in April 199676, to which the Government formally\nresponded in July 199677. It has been pointed out that the UK is fortunate in having a\ngovernment which will listen at all, let alone respond so quickly to its Round Table, but not\nall of the Government's responses were well met78;\n'Round Table members were grateful for the speed of the Government response, and for the\nfact that the Government has agreed with many of the recommendations. They were\nespecially pleased to note new commitments, including initiatives on freight transport route\nscheduling and loadsharing, and the preparation of advice on Life Cycle Assessment.\n'The Round Table noted a number of areas on which the Government proposes further work\nor more detailed study. It intends to keep closely in touch with progress on these, especially\nthe introduction of new procedures for ensuring that all Government Departments carry out\nenvironmental appraisals.\n'The Round Table was disappointed by the Government's reaction to its recommendations on\nliberalisation of the domestic gas and electricity market. The Round Table continues to\nbelieve that Government and the gas and electricity regulators must establish a framework\nwhich allows the environmental and social, as well as the economic, objectives of a sustainable\nenergy policy to be met. Action should include specific objectives and monitoring\narrangements against which the outcome of liberalisation can be judged. The Round Table\nintends to follow up these matters with the regulators and other interested organisations.'\nThe Round Table's sub-group on energy had come to the conclusion that market forces by\nthemselves would not be enough to promote energy efficiency. The Government's refusal to\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n75all January 1996, available from the Round Table's DoE secretariat\n76DoE/UK Round Table on Sustainable Development press notice 2/96 19 April 1996 Sustainable Development\nRound Table publishes first Annual Report\n77HL Deb 4 July 1996 c113WA\n78DoE/UK Round Table on Sustainable Development press notice 290/96 3 July 1996 Round table moves up\na gear\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nchange its thinking regarding the environmental duties of the utility regulators, notably Ofgas\nduring the passage of the Gas Bill, despite amendments tabled by the Earl of Cranbrook (one\nof the Round Table members and chair of English Nature) has raised fears that the Round\nTable may not be in a position to shape policies as much as had been hoped by some79. \nGreenpeace has always been of the opinion that the Government Panel on Sustainable\nDevelopment would much more likely to have real influence than the Round Table, and even\nrefused to join the initiative. However, after initial reservations, other environmental groups\n(Council for the Protection of Rural England, World Wide Fund for Nature, Royal Society\nfor the Protection of Birds and Friends of the Earth) had joined the Round Table after\nreceiving revised proposals as to its operation from the DoE80. \nThe Round Table seems to share the view of many individuals and environmental\norganisations that transport policy is one of the key areas in which sustainability needs to be\napplied, and it gives a high priority to this issue. Following its report on freight transport,\nin June 1996 it published a report on defining a sustainable transport sector (which was\nlargely completed before the publication of the Government's Green Paper Transport - The\nWay Forward but is intended to contribute to that debate)81; \n'The report identifies the economic and social benefits brought by the existing transport\nsystem, but also highlights the problems that are caused. It states that if current trends\ncontinue unchecked, the road network will become increasingly congested, so imposing a\nrising cost on the economy. The overall level of damage to the environment will grow, despite\nsome new standards and technological improvements. And many people will remain\ndisadvantaged, especially those without access to a car.\n     'The report emphasises that there are many ways in which the proposed objectives can be\nachieved. It offers the Round Table's recommendations for action, including:\nsetting national targets for reducing traffic growth;\nthe coordination of policy at local, regional, national and European levels;\na continuation of the shift in public expenditure away from road-building\nand towards road maintenance and support for other transport modes;\nincreased protection for nationally and internationally important conservation\nsites; and\na national public awareness and education programme on the benefits of\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n79ENDS Report October 1995 'Round Table rebuffed again in bid to promote energy saving' pp.29-30\n80ENDS Report January 1995 'Round Table on sustainable development starts work' p.6\n81DoE/UK Round Table on Sustainable Development press notice 232 6 June 1996 UK Round Table on\nSustainable Development publishes report on 'Defining a Sustainable Transport Sector'\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nadopting a sustainable transport strategy'.\nThe Round Table is now working on intermodal transport (passenger and freight), land use\nplanning controls over energy developments, water resources and housing and sustainability82.\n     \nD. Going for Green\nThe UK Strategy83 says that citizens and individuals can play a key part in sustainable\ndevelopment as green consumers and volunteers, at work, as parents and as aware citizens.\n'Going for Green', initially named the 'Citizen's Environment Initiative', was the third of the\nbodies announced by the Prime Minister when unveiling the UK sustainable development\nstrategy, and it was established in February 1995. Its aim is to foster interest in sustainable\ndevelopment and 'in the things people can do in their own lives'. Public attitudes to\nsustainable development were discussed briefly by the Lords Select Committee on Sustainable\nDevelopment84. \nGoing for Green does not seem to have yet taken off in the same way as the Panel and Round\nTable, but this may be because it has been operating in a pilot phase during 1995-6 and will\nbe expanded nationwide throughout the UK over the coming years85. Going for Green\ninitiatives include its 'Green Code' advising people what they can do individually to follow\nmore sustainable lifestyles, and its Sustainable Communities Projects, which are demonstration\nprojects aimed at showing what can be done at community level86 in hand with Local Agenda\n21 plans. 155 schools have joined an Eco-Schools project which promotes green issues87. \nA series of tentative suggestions were made as to its future in the UK Strategy, and its\nadvisory committee came to the end of its life in March 1996, when a private company,\nGoing for Green Ltd, was established in its place. This took over running the Going for\nGreen initiative, aimed at carrying the sustainable development message to individuals and\nlocal communities, from 1 April 1996. It has arranged a programme of work with the DoE,\nwho is giving it £0.5m core funding in 1996-7 together with £300,000 for area projects and\n£700,000 to match private sector sponsorship income.

General Government Policy\n1. Environment Agency Sustainable Development Guidance\nThe Environment Agency came into being on 1 April 1996. (A background is given in\nLibrary Research Paper 95/50 on the Environment Bill.) Section 4 of the Environment Act\n1995 gives Ministers a duty to provide guidance to the Environment Agency in England and\nWales and to the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), particularly relating to\ntheir roles towards achieving sustainable development. \nGovernment Amendments during the passage of the Environment Bill required the Agency\nto promote sustainable development, but included the proviso that this should be subject to\ncost; amendments were moved unsuccessfully to remove this need and the RSPB commented\n'...Clause 4, introduced by the Government at report in the Lords, reinforces the RSPB's\nconcern that the success of the Environment Agency's Management Team in achieving the\n'principle aim' to 'protect or enhance the environment' is to be judged 'by taking into account\nlikely costs'89.\nDraft Statutory Guidance was issued in June 199690. This reiterates the Agency's principle\naim, as defined in Section 4 of the Act: \n 'in discharging its functions the Agency is required so as to protect or enhance the\nenvironment, taken as a whole, as to make the contribution towards attaining the objective of\nachieving sustainable development' \nand goes on, \nthis principle aim is subject to the other provisions of the Environment Act 1995 and any other\nenactment under which the Agency will operate, and to the requirement that the Agency take\ninto account any likely costs, which are defined as including costs to the environment'\nThe draft guidance says that Ministers have decided that the Agency needs to; take a holistic\napproach to the environment; a long term perspective; to have regard for biodiversity, the\nglobal atmosphere and environmental technologies; develop close relationships with the public\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n89RSPB Briefing The Environment Bill HoC Second Reading\n90Draft-The Environment Agency and Sustainable Development.

A lengthy\ncommentary on what constitutes sustainable development is included in the guidance. \nThe explanatory document accompanying the draft guidance notes that the Agency's cost and\nbenefits duty recognises that sustainable development involves reconciling the need for\neconomic development with that for protecting and enhancing the environment, without\ncompromising the ability of future generations to meets their own needs91. \nThe draft guidance includes a requirement to draw up a code of internal guidance or\nenforcement practice, to include advice to staff on when the Agency's discretion will be\nlimited by obligations arising from other duties, requirements and objectives92. \nThis is believed to have been insisted upon by the Deregulation Unit and it is feared by some\ncommentators that this could hamper the Agency in its pollution control work. (The code\nmay have to reflect for instance the principles of Schedule 1 to the Deregulation and\nContracting Out Act 1994, which says that no formal enforcement action may be taken for\na specified period after an officer has expressed an opinion that remedial action should be\ntaken, and also that before any enforcement action is taken officers must send a note\nexplaining their reasons and giving the person concerned the chance to make representations\nagainst this.) Another source of criticism is that unlike the draft guidance itself, the code will\nnot be subject to parliamentary approval93. \n2. Government Departments; Green Ministers and Policy Appraisal\nIn the first environment White Paper This Common Inheritance94 the then Secretary of State\nfor the Environment Chris Patten gave an undertaking to appoint Ministers responsible for\nenvironmental issues in all Government Departments;\n'...a nominated Minister in each Department is to be responsible for considering the\nenvironmental implications of all that Department's policies and spending programmes, and\nfor following up the relevant parts of this White Paper. People outside Government who want\nto discuss things in the White Paper which are the responsibility of particular Departments will\nthen know which Minister to approach'. \nFollowing the 1992 general election 'Green Ministers' were appointed and also incorporated\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n91chapter 5, p. 17\n92p.20 para 5.7\n93ENDS Report 252 January 1996 'Deregulation of enforcement puts Agency at risk' \n94Cm 1200, 1990\n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\ninto a new Ministerial Committee on the Environment (EDE). This, or at least some of its\nmembers, meets 3-4 times a year and should next meet sometime in Summer 1996. Green\nMinisters do not publish minutes of their meetings or Annual Reports, although some\nenvironmental organisations have advocated such an approach. However, John Gummer\nprefers the Green Ministers to be less restricted and to instead represent a general shift to a\ngreener mode or a thread of greenness running through all Government policies95. The DoE\nhas published contact addresses for each Department96. \nIn 1991 the DoE published guides to help Departments assess the environmental implications\nof all of their policies. Environmental appraisal basically entails sizing up the environmental\ncosts and benefits of policies, and by doing this systematically it should be possible to ensure\nthat the environmental impacts of a policy do not get overlooked. (Appraisal involves an\nanalysis of the likely implications of a decision before it is taken whereas evaluation involves\nanalysing the effects of a decision afterwards.) \nUp until 1991 most government departments made use of financial/economic policy appraisal,\nwith largely separate environmental assessments and the two were brought together in a\nsubjective manner to reach a final decision. During a review of the ways in which\nenvironmental costs and benefits of policies were being assessed within government\ndepartments the DoE decided that there was 'scope for a more systematic approach within\ngovernment'. To this end they published Policy Appraisal and the Environment: A Guide\nfor Government Departments97, and Environmental Appraisal in Government Departments98.\nThese do not give hard and fast guidance; there appears to be no uniform method of applying\nenvironmental appraisal nor of making available its results. Some consultants' reports for\ngovernment departments on the costs and benefits of various policies are in the public\ndomain, but others are not. Another problem is that although many environmental decisions\n(such as pollution abatement) will have economic costs attached, some costs and benefits of\na proposed policy may not be reflected in market prices. While a great deal of work is being\ndone at the moment on costing the environment and taking account of environmental\nexternalities, performing an environmental impact assessment remains one of the few\nestablished ways of systematically assessing environmental costs and benefits. \nA series of PQs have indicated that policy appraisal is not being applied as assiduously as the\nDoE might wish99;\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n95Report from the Select Committee on Sustainable Development Volume I-Report.

EC Fifth Environmental Action Programme\nThe Maastricht Treaty states that 'environmental protection requirements must be integrated\ninto the definition and implementation of other Community policies'101. The EC's Environment\n'Action Programmes' set out strategies for environmental policy and give an indication of the\nCommission's legislative intentions. The first was adopted in 1973 and they have usually run\nfor about five years each. \nDuring the fourth Framework Programme the realisation grew that environmental concerns\nneeded integrating into all major policies such as energy, industry and transport. The fifth\nEnvironmental Action Programme Towards Sustainability was developed hand in hand with\nthe Rio process; the Commission first proposed the programme in 1992, and it was adopted\nby Council in February 1993. It is linked closely to the principles of Agenda 21 and so its\nmajor theme is integrating environmental considerations into all policy areas. While it runs\nup to the year 2000, longer than previous programmes, a mid-term review was always planned\nfor the end of 1995102. \nThe UK's interim progress report on the UK action on the fifth Programme was produced in\nDecember 1994103. The Commission's report concluded that while the overall strategy and\naims of the programme remained valid, 'What is lacking are the attitude changes and the will\nto make the quantum leap to make the necessary progress to move towards sustainability'.\nIt has been said that DGXI (the Commission's Environment Directorate) has been hampered\nin implementing the fifth Programme through a legislative programme for 1996 because of\nsubsidiarity and deregulation drives. However, in January 1996 DGXI issued a draft Decision\naimed at kick starting the fifth Action Programme by establishing a set of priorities for the\nyears to 2000. These are to\nImprove integration of environmental and other policies (such as agriculture, transport, energy\nand industry)\nBroaden instruments beyond legislation (voluntary agreements with industry and green taxes\nso long as these are not protectionist)\nRaise awareness of sustainable development issues\nReinforce the EC role in international environmental fora\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n101Sustainable Development The UK Strategy Cm 2426 HMSO 1994\n102ENDS Report 204 January 1992 'Towards sustainable development: A blueprint from Brussels' pp. 20-23\n103EC Fifth Environmental Action Programme Towards Sustainability Government Action in the UK, DoE\nDecember 1994 deposited paper 896\n30\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nImprove implementation and enforcement of EC legislation\nOn appointment the Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said that this last priority\nwas her highest.

The most recent scheme expired at the end of 1995 and\ndistributed around 400 m ECU; the second phase of the programme, Life II, will probably run\nfrom 1996 to 1999 and build on the same areas of funding as the first phase. \n31\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nGlossary\nUNCED UN Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro 1992\nbetter known as the Earth Summit, or Rio\nAgenda 21 The global 'action plan' for sustainability which emerged from Rio\nEarth Summit II The 1997 five year-review of Agenda 21 by the UN General Assembly \nCSD UN Commission on Sustainable Development\nECOSOC UN Economic and Social Council \nunder whose auspices the CSD operates\nUNED-UK UN Environment and Development UK Committee\nUNEP UN Environment Programme\nIIED International Institute for Environment and Development\nHabitat II Second UN Conference on Human Settlements, Istanbul 1996\n(Habitat I took place in Vancouver in 1976)\nPrepCom Preparatory meeting for a major UN conference\nGEF Global Environment Facility\nIMF International Monetary Fund\nTowards Sustainability EU's fifth Environmental Action Programme \nLife EU's 'Financial Instrument for the Environment' \nDGXI European Commission's Environment Directorate \nLA21 Local Agenda 21\nLGMB Local Government Management Board\nNGO Non-Governmental Organisation\nGMO Genetically modified organism\n32\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/87\nFurther reading\nAgenda 21: The UN Programme of Action from Rio Final Text of agreements negotiated by\nGovernments at UNCED 3-14 June 1992, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil UN April 1993\nOur Common Future The World Commission on Environment and Development (Oxford\nUniversity Press) 1987\nSustainable Development The UK Strategy DoE January 1994 Cm 2426\nIndicators of Sustainable Development for the United Kingdom DoE and the Government\nStatistical Service March 1996\nFirst Steps Local Agenda 21 in practice Municipal Strategies for Sustainability as presented\nto the Global Forum Manchester 1994 Manchester City Council HMSO 1994\nBritish Government Panel on Sustainable Development First and Second Reports, DoE\nJanuary 1995 and 1996 respectively \nThe UN CSD Three Years Since the Rio Summit A UNED-UK Report.

This paper presents up-to-date\nresidence-based unemployment rates not published elsewhere for all 651 constituencies in the\nUK, using figures for the number of unemployed claimants from the monthly count and data\nfor the economically active population from the 1991 Census of Population. \nIn May 1996 the Office for National Statistics moved to a 1991 ward base for the\nunemployment statistics. This means that for many constituencies it is no longer possible to\nmake direct comparisons with previously published data. As a result, this Paper no longer\nincludes a table on changes in the level of unemployment in recent years. Research Paper\n96/63 provides a guide to the methodology and to which constituencies are affected by the\nchange in the geographical base.\nJane Dyson\nEconomic Policy Alison Penman\n& Statistics Section Statistics Resource Unit\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n                                                                   \nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not published elsewhere. These use figures for the number of unemployed\nclaimants from the monthly count and figures for the number of people economically active\nderived from the 1991 Census of Population. \nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour, as they take no account of people's ability to seek work outside the constituency\nin which they live. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nthe Research Paper 96/63.\nThe data contained in this Paper are generally not comparable with figures published in this\nseries of Papers of this series prior to May 1996. This is because in May 1996 the ONS\nchanged the geographical basis of the monthly claimant count. Previously, the monthly\nfigures have related to parliamentary constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1981 wards.\nFrom the April 1996 figures onwards, data are based on constituencies defined in terms of\nfrozen 1991 wards. Whilst figures for January, February and March 1996 were re-released\non the new basis, back-runs of figures for dates prior to 1996 will not be published. For\nmany constituencies therefore, there will be a discontinuity in the figures at the end of 1995.\nFor this reason it is no longer possible to produce tables showing the change in the number\nof claimants 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ago. \nNotes to tables:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The\nfollowing abbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\nIND Independent\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/89\n2. The data from the 1991 Census of Population used for the denominators in calculating\nresidence-based unemployment rates were obtained from the dataset known as the\nLocal Base Statistics. In the case of the Censuses for England and Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland, the raw data relate to areas known as \"Enumeration Districts\".\nThese data are first aggregated into electoral wards and then wards are aggregated to\nform constituency totals. In Scotland the raw data relate to \"Output Areas\". These\nfigures are not available at a ward level but are aggregated directly into higher level\ngeographical areas such as constituencies and districts.\nThere is inevitably a time-lag between changes in electoral ward boundaries being\nincorporated into parliamentary constituencies. This means that wards are not always\ncoterminous with constituencies.

However, some\n47,100 of these service personnel were based outside the United Kingdom, and so only 182,200\nregular servicemen are UK-based.  The Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR - now known as the Royal\nIrish Regiment) are not included as regular forces in Ministry of Defence figures.  However, at 30\nApril 1996 there were 2,845 full-time troops in the RIR.  Table 1 looks at the deployment of UK-\nbased Regular Forces and Ministry of Defence civilian manpower within the regions of the United\nKingdom over the last decade.\nIn mid-1995, 34% of the UK-based service personnel were located in the South East, and 25%\nwere located in the South West.  These two regions account for the majority of UK-based\nservicemen with the next largest region in terms of service deployment being Scotland with around\n9% of the UK-based service manpower.\nIn terms of civilian manpower, the South East is again the most prominent region with 40% of the\nUK-based civilians in 1994.  The South West is second with 22% and Scotland is again third with\n10% of the UK-based civilians.\nThe number of service personnel and civilian personnel deployed in the United Kingdom has\ndeclined consistently over the past decade, with further cuts in UK armed forces and Ministry of\nDefence civilians planned by the mid-1990s under Options For Change.\nII Defence Employment\nA. Methodology\nWhilst Ministry of Defence figures are available for the deployment of UK regular forces by region,\nthere are no comprehensive regional figures available for defence-related employment.  This paper\nwill review what regional figures exist, and attempt to estimate the level of defence-related\nemployment in the regions.\nAn important issue among defence economists and other interested parties has been the effect of\ndefence spending on regional and local economies.  In 1986, Ministry of Defence statisticians\ndecided to investigate the possibility of producing regional estimates of defence spending and\ndefence employment. \n\n\nResearch Paper 96/92\n6\nNational Estimates\nThe existing method1 devised to produce national estimates requires the combination of two\nelements.  First, a breakdown of MoD expenditure with UK industry by industrial sector (using the\nStandard Industrial Classification (SIC)); and, second, a measure of sales per employee for each of\nthe industries where defence is significantly large.  Dividing the first by the second gives an estimate\nof those employed directly on defence contracts.\nOf course work is also generated for subcontractors and others who supply the main contractors. \nThis indirect employment is estimated using the industry-by-industry input-output table (produced\nby the Central Statistical Office) which shows the extent to which the output of each industry\ndepends on inputs from supplying industries.  The matrix is used to trace the production chain back\nto raw materials or imports, and the indirect employment over the whole chain is estimated by using\nfigures of sales per employee at each stage.\nAnother sort of indirect employment, that generated by the additional consumer spending which\narises from the defence jobs, is not included in the estimates.  One can therefore draw a distinction\nbetween defence-related employment and employment dependent on defence expenditure (which\nincludes the latter indirect employment).\nThe approach described above is used to produce three different employment estimates: one for\nequipment spending, one for non-equipment spending, and one for UK industry's exports of\ndefence equipment.  For equipment spending, the industrial breakdown of expenditure is principally\nderived from information held on the Ministry of Defence bill-paying computer at Liverpool, on\nwhich every contract paid is coded for industry (using a 3-digit SIC).  Data on non-equipment\nspending (largely fuel, food and clothing) are extracted from the MoD accounting system. \nEstimates of defence exports are derived from a combination of HM Customs and Excise tariff\nheadings that can reasonably be allocated wholly to defence, and from estimates produced by the\nSociety of British Aerospace Companies.  Because exports of some equipment that has both a civil\nand a defence use cannot be identified, and some non-equipment projects such as military\nconstruction also cannot be identified, estimates of both defence exports and of associated\nemployment almost certainly fall short of the true total.\n________________________________________________________________________\n1\n Statement on the Defence Estimates 1988 Volume II (Cm 344-II)\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/92\n7\nRegional Estimates\nThe method used by the MoD to provide a regional analysis of defence employment involves using\nthe existing location codes on the MoD's bill-paying computer at Liverpool.  This results in an\nanalysis of MoD expenditure on equipment by region and industry, which can then be combined\nwherever possible with the most appropriate regional data on sales per employee to give estimates\nof direct employment.  Because no regional information is available for non-equipment spending or\nfor exports, no regional employment estimates are made for these two categories.\n\n\nTable 1\nDeployment Of UK Manpower Within The United Kingdom (a)\nService Manpower: 1 July - thousands Civilian Manpower: 1 July - thousands\nRegion\n1980 1985 1990 1994 1995 % 1980 1985 1990 1994 1995 %\nNorth 1.2 2.3 1.8 2.0 1.5 0.8% 6.3 3.6 3.1 2.6 2.4 2.2%\nYorkshire & Humberside 14.6 14.8 15.5 12.8 12.3 6.8% 9.3 6.3 6.0 4.5 4.1 3.8%\nEast Midlands 13.9 12.9 11.9 9.3 9.4 5.2% 9.1 4.7 3.5 3.7 3.5 3.2%\nEast Anglia 13.8 16.3 14.1 12.5 11.3 6.2% 2.8 2.6 2.5 2.7 3.1 2.9%\nSouth East 94.8 87.3 79.7 68.6 62.4 34.2% 94.6 66.6 57.5 45.8 43.1 39.9%\nSouth West 50.0 48.1 47.2 48.6 45.2 24.8% 50.9 44.0 30.1 24.8 23.2 21.5%\nWest Midlands 9.7 9.4 8.0 5.8 5.1 2.8% 11.0 9.5 8.8 8.2 7.8 7.2%\nNorth West 2.0 2.2 1.5 2.3 2.1 1.2% 12.7 3.1 3.0 2.6 2.4 2.2%\nEngland 200.0 193.3 179.6 162.1 149.4 82.0% 196.6 140.4 114.6 95.0 89.6 83.0%\nScotland 18.1 20.1 19.3 18.0 16.9 9.3% 21.9 18.1 12.3 11.2 10.6 9.8%\nWales 6.9 6.3 5.3 5.5 5.2 2.9% 9.5 6.5 5.5 4.9 4.8 4.4%\nN Ireland (b) 11.9 9.7 11.5 11.6 9.9 5.4% 3.2 2.7 2.7 2.9 3.0 2.8%\nUnited Kingdom (c) 238.1 229.6 215.9 199.5 182.2 100.0% 231.2 167.7 135.2 114.0 108.0 100.0%\nNotes: (a) This table identifies the deployment of UK Regular Forces and MOD civilians.

One reason given for the general\ndecline in equipment employment may be the increasing productivity within manufacturing industry\nas a whole, thereby increasing sales per head and hence lowering the estimate of employment\naccording to the MoD methodology (see Section II(A)).  This falling number of jobs dependent on\nMoD equipment expenditure has also meant a decrease in the number of indirect jobs dependent on\nMoD equipment expenditure - ie jobs at defence equipment subcontractors.\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/92\n11\nEmployment dependent on MoD non-equipment expenditure has also shown a general decline over\nthe decade, but not to the extent of the fall in equipment-related employment.  Hence overall\nemployment supported by MoD expenditure, both direct and indirect, has shown a marked decline\nover the period 1979-80 to 1994-95.\nIn contrast, the level of direct and indirect employment supported by defence exports from the UK\nshowed, if anything, a slight upward trend during the 1980s, although this appears to have been\nsomewhat reversed in the 1990s.  As mentioned earlier, because the defence component of exports\nof some equipment that has both a civil and a defence use cannot be identified, and some non-\nequipment projects such as military construction also cannot be identified, estimates of both defence\nexports and of associated employment almost certainly fall short of the true total. \nC. MoD Regional Estimates\nAs explained in Section II(C), the only regional estimates that the Ministry of Defence provide refer\nto direct employment dependent on MoD defence equipment expenditure.  Table 3 gives a regional\nbreakdown of defence equipment expenditure (net of VAT) and associated direct employment for\n1994-95 (the latest year available) and 1990-91 (for comparison).\nAs can be seen from the table, there are wide differences in regional defence spending.  The most\nimportant region in terms of defence equipment expenditure and associated direct employment in\n1994-95 is the South East.  There may be a statistical bias towards the South East arising from\ncases where bills are paid to head offices in London for work actually done outside the region. \nHowever, the MoD do not believe that this “head office effect” is a large one2.  Wales had the\nlowest proportion of defence equipment expenditure.\nIn terms of defence equipment expenditure per head, the MoD spent £230 per head in the North\nand South West regions.  Wales ranked last under this measure with just £20 per head spent on\ndefence equipment in 1994-95.\nThe comparison of direct employment dependent on MoD equipment expenditure in 1994-95 and\n1990-91 shows clearly that in all regions except Yorkshire and Humberside, direct equipment-\nrelated employment has fallen.  The most significant falls were in the North, where there was a fall\nof 10,000 or 50% in the number of employees directly dependent on MoD equipment expenditure,\nand in the South East where the fall was 16,000 or 32%.\n________________________________________________________________________\n2\n Statement on the Defence Estimates 1988 Vol II p62\n\n\nTable 3\nDefence Expenditure On Equipment & Associated Direct Employment (a) 1994-95 and 1990-91\nExpenditure On Equipment 1994-95 (b) Estimated Employment 1994-95 (c) Estimated Employment 1990-91 (c)\nRegion £ million % £ per head thousands % thousands %\nNorth 700 10.0 230 10 11.0 20 14.5\nYorkshire & Humberside 300 1.5 60 4 4.5 3 2.0\nEast Midlands 200 2.5 50 3 3.5 5 3.5\nEast Anglia 100 1.5 50 2 2.0 3 2.5\nSouth East 2,500 36.5 140 34 38.0 50 36.0\nSouth West 1,100 18.5 230 14 15.5 18 13.0\nWest Midlands 400 7.5 80 5 5.5 8 5.5\nNorth West 750 12.0 120 9 10.0 15 10.5\nEngland 6,050 90.0 120 81 90.0 122 87.5\nScotland 550 7.5 110 7 8.0 14 10.0\nWales 50 1.0 20 1 1.0 1 1.0\nN Ireland 50 1.5 30 1 1.0 2 1.5\nUnited Kingdom 6,700 100.0 110 90 100.0 140 100.0\nNotes: (a) All figures are rounded.\n(b) Expenditure on equipment is shown net of VAT.\n(c) The employment estimates are of direct employment only, i.e. of those working for contractors supplying\nequipment to the MOD.  Employment with suppliers to these contractors is not included.\nSources: Defence Statistics 1996 (HMSO) table 1.9\nOPCS Population Trends 84 Summer 1996\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/92\n13\nThe regional employment figures shown in table 3 refer only to direct employment dependent on\nMoD defence equipment expenditure.  Nationally, however, this direct equipment-related\nemployment accounted for just over one quarter of total defence-related employment in the UK\nin 1994-95.  It is therefore unsatisfactory to use the existing regional figures on direct\nequipment-related employment when discussing the wider issue of the regional economic impact\nof defence expenditure.  The following section attempts to estimate, albeit crudely, the total\nlevel of defence-related employment in the regions.\nIII An Estimate Of Regional Defence Employment\nThe starting point for this estimation is the national estimates in Table 2.  The regional\nbreakdown of the first set of figures (direct employment dependent on equipment expenditure)\nhave already been given in Table 3. \nFor indirect employment dependent on equipment expenditure, it is assumed that the regional\ndistribution of the 85,000 employees in 1994-95 is exactly the same as for the direct\nemployment supported by equipment expenditure - ie the ratio of direct to indirect employment\ndependent on equipment expenditure is assumed to be the same for all regions.  Table 3 sets out\nthe regional proportions which are used.\nNon-equipment expenditure (largely food, fuel and clothing) is assumed to be regionally\ndistributed according to the relative size of the UK regular forces deployed in each region, the\nidea being that the more service personnel in any one region, the more food, clothing and fuel\nexpenditure is likely to be needed.  However, there may in reality be a slight bias to London\n(which would not be taken account of in this regional assumption) because of the\nconstruction/works/fuel/energy costs associated particularly with London-based civilian staff. \nThe latest regional distribution of the UK regular forces for July 1995 is given in Table 1,\nalthough the July 1994 figures are used in the employment estimates for 1994-95.  This regional\ndistribution is applied to the national figures for both direct and indirect non-equipment\nemployment combined.\nThere is a problem when attempting to analyse export-related defence employment by region\nbecause there is no method of determining in which region the employment is based.  Though\none might assume that the regional pattern of export-related employment might reflect the\npattern of equipment-related employment, this is not in fact the case.  By far the largest category\nof defence exports is military aerospace products, the production of which is concentrated in\nonly a few locations:  Bristol, Preston (British Aerospace);  Yeovil (Westland);  Gloucestershire\n(Dowty Aerospace) etc.\n\n\nTable 4\nAn Estimate Of Regional Defence Employment 1994-95 (a)\nDirect Equipment Indirect Equipment Total Non-equipment Export-Related Total Defence\nEmployment Employment (b) Employment (c) (d) Employment (e) Industrial Employment\nRegion per cent thousands per cent thousands per cent thousands per cent thousands per cent thousands\nNorth 11.0% 10 11.0% 9 0.8% 1 0.3% 0 5.6% 20\nYorkshire & Humberside 4.5% 4 4.5% 4 6.8% 6 0.3% 0 3.9% 14\nEast Midlands 3.5% 3 3.5% 3 5.2% 5 0.5% 0 3.1% 11\nEast Anglia 2.0% 2 2.0% 2 6.2% 6 2.4% 2 3.3% 12\nSouth East 38.0% 34 38.0% 32 34.2% 33 42.6% 38 38.1% 137\nSouth West 15.5% 14 15.5% 13 24.8% 24 22.9% 21 20.0% 72\nWest Midlands 5.5% 5 5.5% 5 2.8% 3 6.7% 6 5.3% 19\nNorth West 10.0% 9 10.0% 9 1.2% 1 17.8% 16 9.7% 35\nEngland 90.0% 81 90.0% 77 82.0% 78 93.4% 84 88.9% 320\nScotland 8.0% 7 8.0% 7 9.3% 9 4.0% 4 7.5% 27\nWales 1.0% 1 1.0% 1 2.9% 3 0.5% 0 1.4% 5\nN Ireland 1.0% 1 1.0% 1 5.4% 5 2.1% 2 2.5% 9\nUnited Kingdom 100.0% 90 100.0% 85 100.0% 95 100.0% 90 100.0% 360\n\"Notes: (a) See section 5 for methodology.\n(b) Assumes indirect equipment employment has the same regional pattern as direct equipment employment.\n(c) Includes both direct and indirect non-equipment employment.\n(d) Regional pattern assumed to be the same as the regional distribution of UK-based regular forces as at 1 July 1994.\n(e) Regional pattern assumed to be the same as MoD regional equipment expenditure in the aerospace sector in 1994-95.\nSources: Defence Statistics 1996 (HMSO) Tables 1.9, 1.10, 2.4; MoD\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/92\n15\nTo make some attempt at a regional analysis of defence export-related employment, it is assumed\nthat export employment will follow the pattern of MoD regional equipment expenditure in the\naerospace industry.  The basis of this assumption is that  in recent years around two-thirds of\nidentified defence exports from the UK in 1993 comprised military aircraft and parts, guided\nweapons, missiles and parts and optical equipment and training simulators3.\nBy allocating employment according to MoD expenditure in the aerospace sector, the regions with\nthe most significant aerospace sectors should be identified.  However, this assumption is far from\nperfect: it is not necessarily the case that the export pattern will follow the pattern of MoD\nexpenditure, and not all defence exports are in the aerospace sector.  It also assumes again that\nindirect employment follows the same regional pattern as direct employment.  These assumptions\nappear to suggest that the South East accounts for 38% of export-related employment whilst the\nSouth West and the North West, where much of Britain's aerospace industry is located, account for\njust 23% and 18% of export employment respectively.  However, as mentioned before, there may\nbe a South East bias because of the “head office” effect (see Section II(C)).\nTable 4 thus shows the regional analysis of defence employment dependent on MoD expenditure\nand exports.\nFrom this approximate analysis, it is suggested that the South East has the largest share of defence\nemployment, with around 137,000 employees out of 360,000 in defence industrial jobs supported\nby MoD defence expenditure and exports.  The South West, with around 72,000 employees, ranks\nsecond.  Though the South East experiences the largest economic impact in absolute terms of\nregional defence expenditure, this is not so in relative terms when taking into account the\nimportance of the defence sector in each regional economy.  This is addressed in Section IV.\nIV Summary: regional employment\nOf course when assessing the size of the defence sector in terms of employment in each regional\neconomy, one must not forget to include the service and civilian manpower employed and based in\neach region.  Though they may not contribute directly to the gross domestic product of a region,\ntheir spending power will serve to create employment and output in the region indirectly. \nTo summarise the estimates of regional defence employment presented in this paper, table 6\npresents the estimates of defence-related industrial employment, MoD civilian employment and UK\nRegular Forces for each region for 1994-95, together with the proportion of regional employment\nthat the defence sector is estimated to account for.  Once again, it must be stressed that these\nestimates are no more than crude calculations which are highly dependent on the assumptions made\nin Section III.\nIn terms of the relative importance of the defence sector to the regional economy, one indicator is\nthe proportion of defence employees (defence industry jobs plus MoD civilians) as a proportion of\n________________________________________________________________________\n3\n Defence Statistics 1994 Table 1.11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/92\n16\nthe total number of employees in the region.  The South West with defence employees accounting\nfor 5.6% of the total number of employees in 1994-95 is argued to be the most defence-dependent\nregion on this basis.  The South East, which had the largest defence-related employment and the\nlargest share of MoD equipment expenditure, ranks second highest with 2.6% of employees in the\ndefence sector.\nThe picture is changed slightly if one examines total defence-related employment - ie employees\n(including MoD civilians) plus UK-based regular service personnel - as a proportion of the\nworkforce in employment, which is a broader measure of employment.  The South West is again\nthe most important region, with 6.7% of the workforce employed in the defence sector, well over\ntwice the UK average.  Northern Ireland, even excluding the RIR, has the second highest rate of\ndefence employment with 3.1%.  Including the 3,000 full-time Royal Irish Regiment personnel at 1\nApril 1994, defence-related employment in Northern Ireland would rise from 24,000 to 27,000\nimplying a slightly higher rate as a proportion of the workforce of 3.5%.  The UK average in\n1994-95 was 2.7%.\nIn previous years this paper has presented estimates of defence employment by county.  These were\nbased upon work by the European Commission which gave figures for 1991/92.  It has been\ndecided that, given the changes in the defence industry in recent years, these figures no longer\nprovide a reliable base to calculate county estimates from.  It is likely that defence industry is still\nconcentrated in a small number of counties and regions, with the most dependent areas including:\nCumbria, Fife, Essex, Lancashire and Wiltshire.  However, to continue to publish figures for these\nareas on the basis of out-of-date data would lend unwarranted credibility to estimates which were\ncrude in the first place.\n\n\nTable 5\nEstimated Employment in the Defence Sector 1994-95\nthousands\nIndustrial MoD Total Defence As % Of Total UK-based Defence-Relateds % Of Workforce\nRegion Employment Civilians Employees (b) Employees (c) Regular Forces Employment (d)In Employment (e)\nNorth 20 2.6 23 2.1% 2.0 25 2.0%\nYorkshire & Humberside 14 4.5 18 1.0% 12.8 31 1.5%\nEast Midlands 11 3.6 15 1.0% 9.3 24 1.4%\nEast Anglia 12 2.7 15 1.8% 12.5 27 2.8%\nSouth East 137 46.0 183 2.6% 68.6 252 3.0%\nSouth West 72 24.6 97 5.6% 48.6 145 6.7%\nWest Midlands 19 8.3 27 1.4% 5.8 33 1.5%\nNorth West 35 2.6 38 1.6% 2.3 40 1.5%\nEngland 320 95.0 415 2.3% 162.1 577 2.7%\nScotland 27 11.2 38 1.9% 18.0 56 2.5%\nWales 5 4.9 10 1.0% 5.5 15 1.3%\nN Ireland 9 2.9 12 2.1% 11.6 24 3.1%\nUnited Kingdom 360 114.0 474 2.2% 199.5 674 2.7%\nNotes: (a) Direct and indirect employment supported by MoD expenditure and exports.\n(b) Industrial employment plus MoD civilians.\n(c) Total defence employees as a proportion of all employees in employment in March 1994.\n(d) Defence employees plus UK-based regular forces.\n(e) Total defence-related employment as a proportion of regional workforce in employment (employees plus self-employed plus estim\nSources: Defence Statistics 1996 (HMSO); Employment Gazette (DFEE) October 1996; DFEE data on disk\n\n\nRecent research papers have been:\n96/80 The Dayton Agreement: Progress in Implementation 09.07.96\n96/81 Unemployment by Constituency - June 1996 17.07.96\n96/82 The Constitution: Principles and Development 18.07.96\n96/83 Decommissioning of Nuclear Power Stations 18.07.96\n96/84 Skin Cancer 23.07.96\n96/85 Rail Passenger Franchises (Updates Research Paper 96/21) 08.08.96\n96/86 Unemployment by Constituency - July 1996 14.08.96\n96/87 Sustainable Development: Agenda 21 and Earth Summit II 16.08.96\n96/88 Parliamentary Pay and Allowances: The Current Rates 19.08.96\n96/89 Unemployment by Constituency - July 1996 14.08.96\n96/90 Defence Update 08.10.96\n\n\n\n"

          "The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts\nRegulations\nResearch Paper 96/93\n15 October 1996\nOn 1 July 1995 the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994 came into force\nin the UK. Implementing EC Directive 93/13/EEC, these Regulations now exist alongside\ncurrent legislation in this area. The Regulations are intended to improve the level of\nconsumer protection against unfair terms. As a result, the Regulations have forced UK\nbusinesses to review many forms of standard contracts and their dealings with their customers.\nThe aim of this paper is to provide a brief outline of the Regulations.\nLorraine Conway\nBusiness & Transport Section\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff. Authors are available to discuss the contents of these papers with Members\nand their staff but cannot advise members of the general public.\n\n\nSummary\nThe Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994 [the \"Regulations\"] prohibit the\ninclusion of unfair terms in standard form contracts. The Regulations apply (with certain\nlimited exceptions) to any contract made between a person acting in the course of a business\nand a consumer. They apply to any contract term which has not been individually negotiated.\nUnder the Regulations a consumer is not bound by an unfair standard term in a contract with\na seller or supplier. The Regulations also give the Director General of Fair Trading new\npowers to prevent the continued use of unfair standard terms by businesses in consumer\ncontracts and to prevent anyone recommending such terms.\nA general background to the Regulations is set out in Part I of the paper. The Regulations\nimplement EC Directive 93/13/EEC, adopted on 5 April 1993, on \"Unfair Terms in Consumer\nContracts\". The Regulations only came into force after a lengthy consultation process.\nPart II of the paper interprets the main provisions of the Regulations.\nThe aim of the Regulations is also to prevent the continued use of unfair terms and to provide\nan effective mechanism to this effect. Methods of enforcement and remedies for breach of the\nRegulations are set out in full in Part III.\nPart IV provides a brief outline of the scope of the Regulations. In particular, it addresses how\nthe Regulations affect consumer contracts relating to insurance, banking and financial services.\nThe Regulations add to, and do not replace, existing protection for consumers, particularly\nthat provided under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 [\"UCTA 1977\"]. Therefore, Part V\nof this paper briefly considers the relative scope and cover of UCTA 1977 and the new\nRegulations.\nThe final section of this paper, Part VI, considers the workings and effect of the Regulations\nin their first year.\n\n\nAbbreviations\nThe 'Regulations' Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994\nUCTA 1977 Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977\nDTI Department of Trade and Industry\nOFT Office of Fair Trading\nDirector General Director General of Fair Trading\nThe 'Unit' The Unfair Contract Terms Unit, the Office of Fair Trading\nCML Council of Mortgage Lenders\nABTA Association of British Travel Agents\n\n\nCONTENTS\nPage\nI Background to the new Regulations 7\nII Interpreting the Regulations 9\nA.

The response was such that\nthe DTI decided to make some changes to the proposed Regulations, and a further\nconsultation document was issued in September 1994.3\nThe Regulations4 were enacted in substantially the same form as the draft contained in the\nFurther Consultation Document. The Regulations came into force on 1 July 1995. Welcoming\nthe initiative in December 1994, Consumer Affairs Minister Earl Ferrers said:\n\"This is an important step forward in consumer protection. These Regulations will introduce for\nthe first time a general concept of fairness into consumer contract law in the UK. However, whilst\nI do not believe that any business which deals fairly with its customers has anything to fear from\nthe Regulations, I recognise that many in the business community feel they need more time to\nreview their contracts. We have therefore decided that the Regulations will not come into effect\nuntil 1 July 1995\".5 \nIn brief, the main effect of the Regulations is to prohibit the inclusion of unfair terms in\nstandard form contracts. The Regulations apply, with certain exceptions, to any  term  in  a\ncontract  concluded  between  a  seller  of  goods  or   supplier  of  services  on  the  one  hand,  and\na  consumer  on  the  other,  where  the  term  in  question  has  not  been  individually  negotiated.6\nFor the purposes of the Regulations, a \"consumer\" is any individual (not a company or a firm)\nacting outside the course of business.7 So the Regulations potentially cover all contracts\nentered into by private persons as consumers. They do not apply to contracts between those\nacting for business purposes (such as small traders and larger businesses); nor do they apply\nto contracts solely between private persons none of whom is acting in the course of business.\nIt should also be noted that the Regulations do not apply to contracts other than for the sale\nor supply of goods or the supply of services. \nIt may be difficult in some cases to decide whether or not a person is a consumer, that is,\nacting for purposes which are outside his business. The Regulations make no provision for\nthe burden of proof on this issue. For example, a sole trader entering into a contract for\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, OJ No. L95,\n21.04.93, p.29\n2 Department of Trade and Industry, \"Implementation Of The EC Directive On Unfair Terms In Consumer\nContracts (93/13/EEC) - A Consultation Document\", October 1993\n3 Department of Trade and Industry, \"Implementation Of The EC Directive On Unfair Terms In Consumer\nContracts (93/13/EEC) - A Further Consultation Document\", September 1994\n4 SI 1994 No. 3159. The primary legislation is section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972\n5 Department of Trade and Industry press notice, \"The Unfair Terms In Consumer Contracts Regulations\n1994\", 16 December 1994\n6 Regulation 3(1)\n7 Regulation 2(1)\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\npurposes connected with his business, but which are not central to that business, or where the\npurposes of the transaction are partly personal would be a borderline case. Obviously, it will\nbe necessary for the courts to examine the facts of each case in detail in order to determine\nwhether a person is or is not a consumer.\nUnder the Regulations, a seller or supplier means any person or organisation providing goods\nor services in the course of business.8 The term \"business\" covers any trade or profession, and\nalso the activities of governmental and other public bodies. \nThe Regulations apply only to standard terms; they do not apply to contractual terms which\nhave been individually negotiated. Regulation 3(3) defines a term that has not been\nindividually negotiated between a consumer and a seller or supplier in the following way:\n\"For the purposes of these Regulations, a term shall always be regarded as not\nhaving been individually negotiated where it has been drafted in advance and\nthe consumer has not been able to influence the substance of the term\".\nThe Regulations clearly apply to the kind of standard terms contained in standard form\ncontracts. Such terms do not have to be in writing, but typically they are found in the\n\"conditions of business\" printed in small print on the back of order forms, brochures,\nquotations and so on, and to most standard form banking and insurance documentation.\nThe fact that one specific term in a contract may have been the subject of individual\nnegotiation will not prevent the Regulations from applying to the remainder of the contract.9\nIt is clear, however, that the more a consumer has been able to influence terms in a contract,\nthe less likely it is that the Regulations will apply. This said, the burden of proof is on the\nseller or supplier to show that a particular term has been individually negotiated.10\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 Regulation 2(1)\n9 Regulation 3(4) \n10 Regulation 3(5)\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nII Interpreting the Regulations\nThe Regulations are reprinted in full in Appendix A to this paper.\nThe Regulations apply where contractual terms have not been individually negotiated. The\nRegulations' basic principles are that:11\n• in a contract between a seller or supplier and a consumer, a term will not be binding\non the consumer if it is \"unfair\";\n \n• a seller or supplier must ensure that any written term is expressed in \"plain, intelligible\nlanguage\", and if there is any doubt about its meaning, the interpretation of a term\nmost favourable to the consumer is to prevail.\nA. Terms which may be unfair\nThe basic effect of the Regulations is to introduce into English Law the general concept of\nfairness. If a contractual term within the scope of the Regulations is considered by a court to\nbe unfair, that term will not be binding on the consumer.\nUnder Regulation 4(1) an unfair term is one which \"contrary to the requirement of good faith\ncauses a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations under the contract to the\ndetriment of the consumer\".\nRegulation 4(2) states:\n\"An assessment of the unfair nature of a term shall be made taking into account the nature of the\ngoods or services for which the contract was concluded and referring, as at the time of the\nconclusion of the contract, to all circumstances attending the conclusion of the contract and to all\nthe other terms of the contract or of another contract on which it is dependent\".\nThe burden of proof is on the consumer to show that the term is unfair according to this test.\nHowever, in assessing whether a term is fair, the court is required to take into account not\nonly the literal meaning of the term itself but also the nature of the goods or services\nconcerned, referring, as at the time the contract was made, to all the circumstances. Relevant\ncircumstances would include all the other terms of the contract and the terms of any other\ncontract on which the contract in question is dependent. In effect, the Regulations require the\ncourt to \"assess the situation in the round\" and to adopt a \"commonsense approach to the\nissue of fairness\".12\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n11 Office of Fair Trading briefing, \"Unfair Standard Terms\", July 1995\n12 Alison Padfield, \"The Impact on English contract Law of the EC Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer\nContracts\", 5 Journal of International Banking Law [1995]\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nParagraph 1 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations contains an illustrative list of seventeen types\nof standard contract terms which may be regarded as unfair, and hence automatically causing\na significant imbalance to the detriment of the consumer. For example, a term which has the\neffect of enabling the seller or supplier to alter unilaterally without a valid reason any\ncharacteristics of the product or service to be provided may, according to Schedule 3, be\nregarded as unfair. More importantly, terms which have the effect of excluding or limiting the\nlegal liability of a seller or supplier in the event of the death of a consumer or personal injury\nto the latter resulting from an act or omission of that seller or supplier, may also be unfair\nunder the Regulations. Contractual terms listed in Schedule 3 as possible examples of unfair\nterms include:\na. no liability for death and injury\nb. no liability for breaches of contract\nc. right not to provide services\nd. retention of pre-payments\ne. penalty clauses\nf. general opt-out clauses\ng. right to terminate without notice\nh. automatic renewal clauses\ni. hidden terms\nj. general variation clauses\nk. right to change what is supplied\nl. right to increase the price\nm. right of final decision in contractual disputes\nn. entire agreement clauses and formality requirements\no. unequal obligations\np. right to assign without consent\nq. restrictions on legal remedies\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nMany of the terms described in Schedule 3 and which are deemed to be unfair are those\nwhich result in a consumer being forced to accept greater contractual risks or more onerous\nliabilities than the business party to the contract. However, two points should be noted:\n(i) the list is illustrative, and it is made clear in the body of the Regulations13 that it is non-\nexhaustive. The fact that a term does not figure in the list does not create any presumption\nthat it is therefore fair;\n(ii) the list is of terms which may be regarded as unfair. The appearance of a term in the list\ndoes not automatically mean that it is unfair. The fairness or otherwise of a term must always\nbe judged against the criteria outlined in Section 2, regardless of whether or not it appears in\nSchedule 3.\nIt is also worth noting that certain of the terms are already blacklisted by UK legislation. For\nexample, term (a) [above] which deals with excluding liability for death or personal injury\nis automatically void under section 2(1) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 where\nnegligence is the cause of liability. Since the EC Directive specifically allows Member States\nto retain or adopt more stringent measures if they wish, the relevant legislation in these areas\nwill take precedence over the Regulations.\nB. The requirement of good faith\nCentral to the test of fairness under the Regulations, is a requirement of \"good faith\".\nPrior to the implementation of the Regulations, there was no requirement of 'good faith' under\nthe general English law of contract (although in particular areas of English law, such as trusts,\npartnership and insurance, a duty of good faith is found). \nSchedule 2 to the Regulations contains a list of some of the issues which should be\nconsidered when making an assessment of good faith. The most important issues to be\nconsidered are:\n• the relative bargaining strengths of the consumer and the business; \n• whether the consumer had an inducement to agree to a particular term; \n• whether the goods or services were sold or supplied to the special order of the\nconsumer; and \n• the extent to which the seller or supplier has dealt fairly and equitably with the\nconsumer.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n13 Regulation 4(4)\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nWhere a consumer has been given a genuine choice on whether to agree to a term, fully\nunderstanding what it entailed, and agreed to it freely without having to be pressurised in any\nway, a supplier would have some basis for claiming to have acted in good faith. However,\na supplier might not be able to establish good faith simply by proving that he had disclosed\ncontract terms in full and provided sufficient explanation for them to be understood.\nC. The requirement for plain and intelligible language\nRegulation 6 states simply that in any standard form contract:\n\"a seller or supplier shall ensure that any written term of a contract is expressed in plain,\nintelligible language, and if there is doubt about the meaning of a written term, the interpretation\nmost favourable to the consumer shall prevail\".\nAlthough there is no separate sanction for failure to comply with this provision, whether or\nnot a term is expressed in plain, intelligible language is relevant in assessing whether a term\nis unfair. \nWhere the basic terms of a contract are not clearly expressed, the whole contract may be open\nto attack by a consumer. Any doubts about the meaning of a written term are to be resolved\nin favour of the consumer. It should be pointed out that this is in sharp contrast to the\nposition which prevails under the common law, which is that, with certain limited exceptions,\na party who signs a contract is bound by it, whether or not he or she read and understood it\nbefore signing.14\nD. Exclusions\nSchedule 1 to the Regulations contains a list of specialised contracts and particular terms\nwhich are excluded from the scope of the Regulations. The Regulations do not apply to:\n• any contract relating to employment;\n• any contract relating to succession rights (inheritance, for instance);\n• any contract relating to rights under family law (such as maintenance payments);\n• any contract relating to the incorporation and organisation of companies or\npartnerships; and,\n• any term incorporated in order to comply with or which reflects\n(i) statutory or regulatory provisions of the United Kingdom; or\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 Alison Padfield, \"The Impact On English Contract Law Of The EC Directive On Unfair Terms\", 5 Journal\nof International Banking Law [1995]\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\n(ii) the provisions or principles of international conventions to which the\nMember Sates of the Community are party.\nIn addition, two important types of standard terms (ie. known as \"core terms\") are also\nexcluded from the Regulations. Regulation 3(2) states:\n\"In so far as it is in plain, intelligible language, no assessment shall be made of the fairness of any\nterm which- \n(a) defines the main subject matter of the contract, or\n(b) concerns the adequacy  of  the  price  or  remuneration, as against the goods or services sold or\nsupplied\".\nIn other words, terms which define the main subject matter of the contract or which set the\nprice to be paid for it are excluded from the test of fairness but this exemption applies only\nto the term in question, not to the remainder of the contract. While these so-called \"core\nprovisions\" will not be addressed for fairness, they will remain factors which can be taken\ninto account in assessing the fairness of other terms.\nIt should also be emphasised that, for the exemption to apply the term in question must be\nin plain, intelligible language, and to the extent that it is not, it may be open to challenge\nunder Regulation 6.15 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n15 See Section II (C) of this Research Paper \n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nIII Remedies and enforcement\nUnder the Regulations, the effect of a finding that a term is unfair is that it shall not be\nbinding on the consumer.16 The aim of the Regulations is also to prevent the continued use\nof unfair terms and to provide an adequate and effective mechanism to this effect.\nRegulation 8 requires the Director General of Fair Trading [the \"Director General\"] to\nconsider any complaint that a contract term drawn up for general use is unfair. The Director\nGeneral is under a duty to consider any complaint unless it appears \"frivolous or vexatious\".17\nIf he decides that a particular standard term is unfair, he can accept appropriate undertakings\noffered by the business concerned. It may, for example, give an undertaking to stop using\nsuch a term altogether, or to revise its standard terms in order to avoid the perceived\nunfairness.\nIf no undertaking is given to withdraw or amend a term, the Director General can seek a High\nCourt injunction (or in Scotland, a Court of Session interdict) to prevent the continued use\nof that term or a term having like effect in contracts drawn up for general use. He may also\nseek a temporary injunction or interdict to prevent the use of the term until the case can be\nfully argued in court. The Director General has a duty to give reasons for his decision to\napply (or not to apply) for an injunction.\nWelcoming these new powers, Jeffrey Preston, then Director General, said:\n\"I welcome these new powers which will help to prevent unfair terms from appearing in the small\nprint of consumer contracts. This will be an important advance in consumer protection.\n....The Regulations give me considerable scope in dealing with problems which arise, and in most\ncases it should be possible to resolve matters quickly without resort to court action. But I will not\nhesitate to seek an injunction from the courts if this becomes necessary.\nOne effect of the new Regulations will be that an unfair term is not binding on the consumer. This\nwill enable consumers themselves to challenge or resist enforcement of such terms by traders\".18\nIn practice, the Director General's responsibilities are handled on a day-to-day basis by a\ngroup set-up within the Office of Fair Trading [the \"OFT\"], and known as the \"Unfair\nContract Terms Unit\". It is intended that individual consumers who find that their concluded\ncontracts may contain unfair terms will have the full range of normal civil law remedies\navailable to them. According to the DTI19, it is not intended that the Director General will\nexercise his powers to obtain a direct civil law remedy in the case of a particular aggrieved\nconsumer, rather that he will act in the more general interests of consumers and competitors\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n16 Regulation 5(1)\n17 Regulation 8(1)\n18 Office of Fair Trading press notice,\"Fair terms in consumer contract - new powers come into effect\", 30 June\n1995\n19 Department of Trade and Industry Guidance Notes, \"The Unfair Terms In Consumer Contracts Regulations\n1994\", July 1994 \n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nto ensure that unfair terms do not, once identified, continue in use. The Director General also\nhas power under Regulation 8(7) to arrange for the dissemination of advice and information\nas to the operation of the Regulations.\nIf a contractual term is found to be unfair and, therefore, unenforceable, the remainder of the\ncontract will not be affected, provided that it is capable of continuing in existence without the\nunfair term. If so much of the contract is tainted by unfairness that it becomes incapable of\ncontinuing in existence, the Regulations provide that the contract shall cease to bind the\nparties.20\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n20 Regulation 5(2)\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nIV The scope of the Regulations\nA. Conflict of laws\nThe provisions of the Regulations apply regardless of any contract term which applies or\nseeks to apply the law of a state outside the EC if the contract \"has a close connection with\nthe territory of the Member States\".21\nIn effect, Regulation 7 is designed to prevent any 'improper' avoidance of the Regulations.\nB. The effect of the Regulations \n1. On Consumer Contracts\nA consumer is not bound by an unfair standard term in a contract with a business. What this\nmeans in practice depends on the nature of the term. For instance, a business would not be\nable to rely on a term that unfairly sought to make a consumer pay more than the originally\nagreed price if it went to court to try to enforce the extra payment. Similarly, a term which\npurports to say that customers have no right to compensation for (say) poor workmanship,\nmay be deemed to be unfair and a consumer could still sue a business for damages.\nThe fact that a business cannot enforce an unfair term against a consumer does not mean that\nthe rest of the contract falls away, so long as it is capable of continuing to exist without that\nterm.\nFor the individual consumer, the Regulations simply mean that the business cannot enforce\nterms that are unfair against him or her. They provide no criminal penalty for the use of any\nunfair term. So the Regulations are relevant only where the consumer is in dispute with the\nbusiness over a contract, and the dispute could go, or has gone, to court. \nAlthough the Director General of Fair Trading has certain powers under the Regulations, he\ncannot help any individual consumer in a private dispute by seeking compensation or other\nredress for problems experienced in the past. He can only step in to protect consumers in\ngeneral by seeking to prevent the continued use of any particular unfair term in the future.\nThe Regulations have obvious application to standard contracts relating to consumers in the\ncommercial world.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n21 Regulation 7\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\n2. The effect of the Regulations on insurance contracts\nThe Regulations apply to insurance contracts which were specifically excluded from the ambit\nof previous consumer protection legislation.22 The application of the Regulations to the\ninsurance industry has been discussed at length in the consultative process. \nIt is probably because it is the first time that any consumer legislation regulating contract\nterms has extended to the insurance field that there has been a great deal of commentary on\nthe impact of the Regulations in the insurance press. It is likely that the Regulations will have\nthe greatest impact on household, motor vehicle and life insurance policies, since those are\nthe types of insurance commonly entered into by consumers. The main points of particular\ninterest to insurers are summarised below:\n• In practice, the Regulations will only apply to direct insurance with individuals. This\nhas some results which might not, at first glance, be expected. For example, the\nRegulations will not apply to a commercial motor fleet policy, even though such\npolicies may well cover private individuals driving for social, domestic and pleasure\npurposes, because \"consumer\" means a person who, in making the contract, is acting\nfor purposes outside his business.\n• Any term which:\n(a) defines the main subject matter of the contract; or\n(b) concerns the adequacy of the price or remuneration, is not to be assessed for\nfairness, provided it is in plain, intelligible language.\nThe clauses of an insurance contract which define, or circumscribe, the peril insured\nand the insurers' liability have been cited as a typical example of clauses which will\ncome within this exception. The extent of the risk is something which is taken into\naccount in fixing the premium, and so such terms will be within this exception.\nHowever, it should be noted that the fairness of these clauses can still be considered\nif they are not in plain, intelligible language. Further, if there is any doubt about the\ninterpretation of such clauses, the most favourable interpretation to the insured is to\nprevail. It is, therefore, sensible for the insurer to make sure that any exceptions are\nclearly referred to in the clauses themselves, and not hidden away at the back of the\npolicy somewhere.\nIt should also be noted that one of the factors expressly to be taken into account in\nassessing the fairness of a term is the other terms of the contract. Therefore, the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n22 Note. Insurance contracts are wholly exempted from the scope of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 under\nSchedule 1 paragraph 1(a) \n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nclauses relating to the ambit of the risk may themselves be relevant for assessing the\nfairness of other terms, even if their own fairness is not itself susceptible to scrutiny.\n• The concept of \"good faith\" is a new concept in English consumer law. It remains to\nbe seen how the courts will interpret it. They may have regard to the principle of\nuberrimae fides (ie. 'the utmost good faith') which has long been observed by the\nparties to contracts of insurance. However, the concept of \"good faith\" under the\nRegulations is certainly not identical to the principle of uberrimae fides in insurance\ncontracts. For example, whereas a breach of the duty of uberrimae fides may render\nan entire insurance contract void from policy inception, an insurance contract will\nsurvive the striking down of a term for unfairness under the Regulations, provided it\nis capable of continuing in existence without the offending term.\n• As outlined above, Schedule 3 to the Regulations sets out a list of examples of clauses\nwhich may be unfair. Although effectively no more than guidance, Schedule 3 gives\na helpful illustration of potential areas of concern. None of these relate specifically to\ninsurance contracts, but those which may be relevant in the insurance context include\nthe following:\n (a) Terms which \"irrevocably bind...the consumer to terms with which he had\nno real opportunity of becoming acquainted before the conclusion of the\ncontract\". This may tend to discourage the practice of supplying the policy\nwording after the inception of the policy, at least where the insured is not\nsimply renewing a policy on similar terms to a previous one.\n(b) A term \"excluding or hindering the consumer's right to take legal\naction....particularly by requiring the consumer to take disputes exclusively to\narbitration not covered by legal provisions\". Under English law, the extent to\nwhich the parties can agree to arbitrators being empowered to disregard legal\nprinciples is, of course, limited anyway.\nThe OFT has a duty, when a complaint is made about the terms of a standard contract,\nto investigate the complaint and, if appropriate, take action including seeking an\ninjunction against the party recommending such terms. This provision is of general\napplication. It is possible, however, that since it is common for members of the public\nto complain about the lack of clarity in insurance contracts, policies of insurance may\nbe particularly susceptible to such action where insurers have not thoroughly reviewed\nand updated their policy wording in the light of the Regulations. \n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\n3. The effect of the Regulations on the financial services industry\nThe Regulations are targeted at standard form terms in a wide range of contracts including:\n• consumer credit (including the issue of credit cards);\n• mortgage agreements;\n• issue of commodity futures and options; and\n• investment services contracts.\nSince the Regulations do not define the terms \"goods\" or \"services\", they have been taken to\nhave a wide meaning and generally to include most types of financial services. \nSchedule 3 to the Regulations highlights as potentially unfair, terms which:\n• enable the supplier to terminate a contract of indefinite duration without reasonable\nnotice, other than where there are serious grounds for doing so;23\n• enable the supplier to change unilaterally the terms of the contract, without a \"valid\nreason\" which is specified in the contract;24 and\n• which allow a supplier to increase the price, without giving the consumer the right to\ncancel the contract where the price rise is disproportionately high.25\nHowever, these provisions do not apply to products or services the price of which is linked\nto a stock exchange index or financial market rate, including transactions in securities and\nfinancial instruments.26 Price indexation clauses are not affected by the provision limiting the\nuse of terms which allow the supplier to increase the price, provided that the method of\ncalculation of price changes is clearly set out in the contract.27\nOther specific provisions govern the ability of a supplier of financial services to alter interest\nrates or other charges: a term allowing the supplier to alter unilaterally the terms of the\ncontract other than for a \"valid reason\" as specified in the contract is likely to be held to be\nunfair, unless notice is given.28 Where a valid reason for the alteration exists, notice need not\nbe given in advance, but the consumer must be informed of the change as soon as practicable\nand given the option of cancelling the contract.29\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n23 Schedule 3, paragraph 1(g)\n24 Schedule 3, paragraph 1(j)\n25 Schedule 3, paragraph 1(i)\n26 Schedule 3, paragraph 2(c)\n27 Schedule 3, paragraph 2(d)\n28 Schedule 3, paragraph 1(j)\n29 Schedule 3, paragraph 2(b)\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nThese provisions are designed to ensure that consumers are informed before entering into an\nagreement, such as a mortgage, personal loan or investment bond, of the terms and conditions\nwhich will apply, and to ensure that variations in those initial terms and conditions are fair\nand reasonable. The option given to consumers of cancelling contracts where suppliers of\nfinancial services attempt to reserve to themselves the right to make changes without a valid\nreason is likely to have a beneficial effect on the drafting of contracts for financial services\nand on the behaviour of the suppliers of those services once contracts have been entered into. \n4. The effect of the Regulations on the retail banking industry\nThe implications for the retail banking industry are also substantial. There is no doubt that\nthe Regulations will apply to a vast number of everyday banking agreements including the\npurchase or sale of:\n• mortgages;\n• loan agreements;\n• foreign currency;\n• travellers' cheques;\n• international money orders denominated in foreign currency; and ,\n• retail banking agreements (including the conditions of use of credit and debit cards).\nSuch banking agreements are usually in standard form and are therefore within the scope of\nthe Regulations. \nIt should be pointed out, however, that there is an overlap between the Regulations and the\nvoluntary retail banking code \"Good Banking\" (a non-statutory provision), which addresses\nthe main terms on which banks should deal with their retail customers.\nThe Regulations are not clear-cut, so it will be necessary for banks to consider carefully\nwhether the Regulations do and are intended to apply in particular circumstances. Such an\nanalysis may be subject to review by the courts.\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nC. Compliance Costs\nThe wide scope of the Regulations means that vast numbers of contracts will be affected. In\nits \"Further Consultation Document\"30 the DTI concludes that it is difficult to produce\ncompliance costs estimates for the \"typical business\" as there are wide differences in the\nnumber of standard terms companies may use and in the way these are published. However,\nthe document does give examples of likely compliance costs for a number of organisations,\nand this information has since been updated.31 The British Bankers' Association, for example,\nestimates that the cost for a large bank to examine its standard terms and conditions, then\nreprint and circulate them to its branches could be between £500,000 and £1 million in the\nfirst instance.32\nThe Council of Mortgage Lenders (\"CML\") estimate non-recurring costs (eg. reviewing\ncontracts, system changes etc) of £10 million for building societies and other mortgage\nlenders.33 Recurring annual costs (altering interest rates, reviewing documentation, marketing,\nconsumer complaints etc) are estimated by the CML to be £60 million for building societies\nand up to £10 million for other lenders.34\nThe Association of British Travel Agents (\"ABTA\") estimate that the potential compliance\ncost to even relatively small companies with a turnover of, perhaps £500,000, could be in\nexcess of £10,000 per company. Large companies may have costs of up to several hundred\nthousand pounds due to the volume of documentation produced and the number of employees\nthat must be retrained.35\nThere is little doubt that compliance with the Regulations will require businesses to incur\nsubstantial costs, in redrafting their standard form contracts and paying higher insurance fees\nin anticipation of a potentially wider set of claims. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n30 Department of Trade and Industry, \"Implementation Of The EC Directive On Unfair Terms In Consumer\nContracts(93/13/EEC) - A Further Consultation Document\", September 1994\n31 Department of Trade and Industry, \"The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994: Compliance\nCost Assessment\", December 1994\n32 Ibid page 2\n33 Ibid page 2 \n34 Ibid page 3\n35 Ibid page 4\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nV How the Regulations relate to existing law on unfair\nterms\nWith certain exceptions (for example, where contracts relate to insurance, property\ntransactions and certain financial transactions) most businesses are already subject to the\nUnfair Contract Terms Act 1977 [the \"UCTA 1977\"]. The new Regulations are intended to\nadd to, and not replace, existing protection for consumers, particularly that provided under the\nUCTA 1977.\nThe UK Regulations follow closely the wording of the Council Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair\nterms in consumer contracts. There has been criticism of the Government in this respect,\nparticularly because the existing regime of the UCTA 1977 is left in place unaltered. In effect,\nbusinesses now have to take account of two differing regimes applying to contract terms,\nwhere before there was one. Where a clause is disputed, it will be necessary to determine its\nvalidity both against the UCTA 1977 and against the Regulations.\nThat said, the extent to which the UCTA 1977 and the Regulations overlap is, in fact, limited.\nAlthough the earlier legislation offers protection that is generally similar to that embodied by\nthe Regulations as regards consumer contracts, it covers a narrower range of types of contract\nterms. For example:\n1. In the main, the UCTA 1977 deals with exclusion clauses in both consumer and\nbusiness contracts, whereas the Regulations apply only to terms in contracts with\nconsumers. If, therefore, the clause in question appears in a business contract, only the\nUCTA 1977 will be relevant.\n2. The UCTA 1977 can apply to negotiated contracts whereas the Regulations apply only\nto consumer contracts which have not been individually negotiated. \n3. The list of contracts excluded from the respective enactments differs. The UCTA 1977\ndeals primarily with exclusion clauses. Contracts relating to insurance, property\ntransactions and certain financial transactions are wholly outside its scope. The\nRegulations, with certain limited exceptions, apply to all  non-negotiated contractual\nterms in consumer contracts (eg. insurance contracts fall within the regulations).\n4. Except where not expressed in plain, intelligible language, the Regulations do not\napply to core provisions. In contrast, whether a provision is or is not a core provision\nis not relevant to the application of the UCTA 1977. \n5. The Regulations apply a test of \"fairness\" and \"good faith\", whereas the UCTA 1977\napplies a different test, that of \"reasonableness\".\n6. Schedule 2 of the Regulations gives a definition of \"good faith\" and a list of matters\nto be taken into account in assessing good faith. These matters reflect quite closely the\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nguidelines for the application of the \"reasonableness test\" in Schedule 2 of the UCTA\n1977, but they are by no means identical. For example, the latter refers to \"whether\nthe customer knows or ought reasonably to have known of the existence and extent\nof the term\" (having regard, among other things, to any custom of the trade and any\nprevious course of dealing between the parties), but this is not included in the\nRegulations.\n7. The Regulations narrowly define a consumer as any living individual acting for\npurposes outside his business. The definition of someone \"dealing as a consumer\"\nunder the UCTA 1977 has been interpreted widely by the courts to include legal\npersons (such as companies) where they are acting outside the normal course of their\nbusiness. In effect, under the UCTA 1977 a company may sometimes be treated as a\nconsumer.\nQuoting similar examples to those outlined above, the DTI has stated36 that the effect of the\nRegulations is to create a regime which is quite distinct and separate from the UCTA 1977.\nHowever, it has also acknowledged that most of the terms which would be \"unfair\" under the\nnew Regulations could already be assessed under the 1977 Act. The DTI has stated that in\nits view, the application of the test of \"fairness\" in the Regulations and the test of\n\"reasonableness\" in the UCTA 1977 is likely in most cases to lead to broadly similar results.37\nThe Regulations undoubtedly improve the level of consumer protection throughout the UK.\nIn doing so, they do impose additional burdens on those businesses which deal directly with\nconsumers, requiring them to ensure that their standard form contracts comply with the\nRegulations. Ultimately, where a clause is disputed, it will be left to the English courts to\ndetermine its validity both against the UCTA 1977 and against the new Regulations and to\nconsider the relationship between the two tests of \"fairness\" and \"reasonableness\". \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n36 Department of Trade and Industry, \"The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994 -\nCompliance Cost Assessment\", December 1994 \n37 Ibid\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nVI The workings and effect of the Regulations in their\nfirst year\nIn May 1996, the OFT published its first bulletin38 on the workings and effect of the\nRegulations in their first nine months of operation. The bulletin gives guidance on the sorts\nof terms and conduct which in the OFT's opinion will fall foul of the Regulations and on\nwhich the Director General is willing to act. It identified five categories of terms which have\nmost commonly been encountered in complaints. These are:\n1. Entire agreement clauses which purport to exclude from the contract anything said or\npromised by a salesman or agent of the company.\n2. Hidden clauses in which the seller or supplier attempts to bind a consumer to terms which\nthey could not know before entering into a contract.\n3. Penalty clauses in which, for example, companies are permitted to retain deposits with no\ncounterbalancing penalty for the company if it does not comply with its obligations.\n4. Exclusion clauses which attempt to exclude liability for every possible eventuality.\n5. Variation clauses giving the supplier the right to put up prices with no realistic right for\nthe consumer to withdraw without penalty.\nIn this first bulletin the OFT also highlights for specific criticism certain types of clauses and\npractices:\n• According to the OFT, illegible print and obscure wording can, by themselves, make\nterms unenforceable because the Regulations specifically require the consumer to be\nable to examine all the terms before he is bound.\n• The OFT also stresses that even the apparently excluded 'core terms' can be scrutinised\nunder the Regulations if they have not been adequately brought to the consumer's\nattention prior to conclusion of the contract. \nThe OFT comments that in the main it is smaller suppliers who have shown least awareness\nof the Regulations, although this has not prevented some large companies from also falling\nfoul of the Regulations.\nIn its second bulletin39, published in September 1996, the OFT reviews the first full year of\noperation of the Regulations. It also gives statistical analysis of complaints received. It reveals\nthat up to 30 June 1996, the Unfair Contract Terms Unit [the \"Unit\"] had received 817\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n38 Office of Fair Trading, Unfair Contract Terms, Bulletin Issue No. 1, May 1996 \n39 Office of Fair Trading, Unfair Contract Terms, Bulletin Issue No. 2, September 1996 \n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\ncomplaints. In roughly one-third of the cases brought to the Unit's attention, action under the\nRegulations proved to be inappropriate but action was taken in the remaining two-thirds of\ncases. \nThe Unit reports that few business sectors seem to be immune from the use of unfair terms.\nAccording to the information given in this second bulletin, work in hand for the Unit ranges\nfrom consumer agreements for mobile phones and travel contracts, to wheel-clamp removal\nbusinesses and monumental masons. It also reports that potentially unfair terms seem to be\nwidely used in home improvement and furnishing businesses and where goods are sold in the\nhome, including double glazing. \nExperience in this first year of operation has led the Unit to conclude that:\n\" ... the use of unfair terms in consumer contracts is widespread and amounts to a serious problem\nin the United Kingdom. This was contrary to our expectations. Before the Regulations came on\nstream some commentators had suggested, optimistically, that most businesses would adapt their\ncontracts, without prompting, in order to comply with the Regulations. There would be a few\nstragglers and perhaps some firms who had been badly advised on the application of the\nRegulations to their consumer contracts or who had simply not appreciated their wider effects -\nso there would be some mopping up to do, but little more. It now appears however that awareness\nof the Regulations, and the implications they have for the way that consumer contracts are drawn\nup, has spread much more slowly than we had anticipated - particularly among small traders and\ntheir legal advisers.\nWe have been very disturbed to find that unfair terms often conflict not only with the requirements\nof the Regulations but with consumer protection legislation that has been in place for much longer.\nExamples include exclusion clauses that are void under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the\nConsumer Arbitration Agreement Act 1988, and others that give rise to offences under the\nConsumer Transactions (Restrictions on Statements) Order 1976.\"40\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n40 Ibid, page 5\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\nVII Further reading\n1.

(1) Subject to the provisions of Schedule 1, these Regulations apply to any term in\na contract concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer where the said term has not\nbeen individually negotiated,\n(2) In so far as it is in plain, intelligible language, no assessment shall be made of the\nfairness of any term which  \n(a) defines the main subject matter of the contract, or\n(b) concerns the adequacy of the price or remuneration, as against the goods or\nservices sold or supplied.\n(3) For the purposes of these Regulations, a term shall always be regarded as not\nhaving been individually negotiated where it has been drafted in advance and the consumer\nhas not been able to influence the substance of the term.\n(4) Notwithstanding that a specific term or certain aspects of it in a contract has been\nindividually negotiated, these Regulations shall apply to the rest of a contract if an overall\nassessment of the contract indicates that it is a pre-formulated standard contract.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \nc Protocol 47 and certain Annexes to the EEA Agreement were amended by Decision No. 7/94 of the EEA\nJoint Committee which came into force on 1 July 1994, (O.J.

(1) In these Regulations, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) below, \"unfair term\" means\nany term which contrary to the requirement of good faith causes a significant imbalance in\nthe parties' rights and obligations under the contract to the detriment of the consumer.\n(2) An assessment of the unfair nature of a term shall be made taking into account the\nnature of the goods or services for which the contract was concluded and referring, as at the\ntime of the conclusion of the contract, to all circumstances attending the conclusion of the\ncontract and to all the other terms of the contract or of another contract on which it is\ndependent.\n(3) In determining whether a term satisfies the requirement of good faith, regard shall be\nhad in particular to the matters specified in Schedule 2 to these Regulations.\n(4) Schedule 3 to these Regulations contains an indicative and non-exhaustive list of the\nterms which may be regarded as unfair.\nConsequence of inclusion of unfair terms in contracts\n5.

(1) It shall be the duty of the Director to consider any complaint made to him that any\ncontract term drawn up for general use is unfair, unless the complaint appears to the Director\nto be frivolous or vexatious.\n(2) If having considered a complaint about any contract term pursuant to paragraph (1)\nabove the Director considers that the contract term is unfair he may, if he considers it\nappropriate to do so, bring proceedings for an injunction (in which proceedings he may also\napply for an interlocutory injunction) against any person appearing to him to be using or\nrecommending use of such a term in contracts concluded with consumers.\n(3) The Director may, if he considers it appropriate to do so, have regard to any\nundertakings given to him by or on behalf of any person as to the continued use of such a\nterm in contracts concluded with consumers.\n(4) The Director shall give reasons for his decision to apply or not to apply, as the case\nmay be, for an injunction in relation to any complaint which these Regulations require him\nto consider.\n(5) The court on an application by the Director may grant an injunction on such terms as\nit thinks fit.\n(6) An injunction may relate not only to use of a particular contract term drawn up for\ngeneral use but to any similar term, or a term having like effect, used or recommended by any\nparty to the proceedings.\n(7) The Director may arrange for the dissemination in such form and manner as he\nconsiders appropriate of such information and advice concerning the operation of these\nRegulations as may appear to him to be expedient to give to the public and to all persons\nlikely to be affected by these Regulations.\nFerrers\nMinister of State,\n8th December 1994 Department of Trade and Industry\n31\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/93\n SCHEDULE 1 Regulation 3(1)\nCONTRACTS AND PARTICULAR TERMS EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE\nOF THESE REGULATIONS\nThese Regulations do not apply to  \n(a) any contract relating to employment;\n(b) any contract relating to succession rights;\n(c) any contract relating to rights under family law;\n(d) any contract relating to the incorporation and organisation of companies or\npartnerships; and\n(e) any term incorporated in order to comply with or which reflects  \n(i) statutory or regulatory provisions of the United Kingdom; or\n(ii) the provisions or principles of international conventions to which the member\nStates or the Community are party.\nSCHEDULE 2 Regulation 4(3)\nASSESSMENT OF GOOD FAITH\nIn making an assessment of good faith, regard shall be had in particular to  \n(a) the strength of the bargaining positions of the parties;\n(b) whether the consumer had an inducement to agree to the term;\n(c) whether the goods or services were sold or supplied to the special order of the\nconsumer, and\n(d) the extent to which the seller or supplier has dealt fairly and equitably with the\nconsumer.\nSCHEDULE 3 Regulation 4(4)\nINDICATIVE AND ILLUSTRATIVE LIST OF TERMS WHICH MAY BE\nREGARDED AS UNFAIR\n1.

This paper presents up-to-date\nresidence-based unemployment rates not published elsewhere for all 651 constituencies in the\nUK, using figures for the number of unemployed claimants from the monthly count and data\nfor the economically active population from the 1991 Census of Population. \nIn May 1996 the Office for National Statistics moved to a 1991 ward base for the\nunemployment statistics. This means that for many constituencies it is no longer possible to\nmake direct comparisons with previously published data. As a result, this Paper no longer\nincludes a table on changes in the level of unemployment in recent years. Research Paper\n96/63 provides a guide to the methodology and to which constituencies are affected by the\nchange in the geographical base.\nJane Dyson\nEconomic Policy Alison Penman\n& Statistics Section Statistics Resource Unit\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n                                                                   \nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not published elsewhere. These use figures for the number of unemployed\nclaimants from the monthly count and figures for the number of people economically active\nderived from the 1991 Census of Population. \nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour, as they take no account of people's ability to seek work outside the constituency\nin which they live. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nthe Research Paper 96/63.\nThe data contained in this Paper are generally not comparable with figures published in this\nseries of Papers of this series prior to May 1996. This is because in May 1996 the ONS\nchanged the geographical basis of the monthly claimant count. Previously, the monthly\nfigures have related to parliamentary constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1981 wards.\nFrom the April 1996 figures onwards, data are based on constituencies defined in terms of\nfrozen 1991 wards. Whilst figures for January, February and March 1996 were re-released\non the new basis, back-runs of figures for dates prior to 1996 will not be published. For\nmany constituencies therefore, there will be a discontinuity in the figures at the end of 1995.\nFor this reason it is no longer possible to produce tables showing the change in the number\nof claimants 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ago. \nNotes to tables:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The\nfollowing abbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\nVAC Vacant seat\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/95\n2. The data from the 1991 Census of Population used for the denominators in calculating\nresidence-based unemployment rates were obtained from the dataset known as the\nLocal Base Statistics. In the case of the Censuses for England and Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland, the raw data relate to areas known as \"Enumeration Districts\".\nThese data are first aggregated into electoral wards and then wards are aggregated to\nform constituency totals. In Scotland the raw data relate to \"Output Areas\". These\nfigures are not available at a ward level but are aggregated directly into higher level\ngeographical areas such as constituencies and districts.\nThere is inevitably a time-lag between changes in electoral ward boundaries being\nincorporated into parliamentary constituencies. This means that wards are not always\ncoterminous with constituencies. Where this is the case, wards have been best-fitted\nto constituencies on the basis of the constituency where the majority of the population\nare thought to live.

Its Government will have the right to pursue trade relations\non its own account.\nTrade missions established in the United Kingdom are normally accorded consular status,\nwhich entails certain privileges and immunities.\nThe Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Bill is designed to extend a set of consular\nprivileges and immunities to offices established by the Hong Kong SAR Government in the\nUK in order to further its economic and trade interests.\nIn part, the Bill is in response to the unusual status which Hong Kong will attain after it\nreverts to China. The Hong Kong SAR will not be subject to the provisions of existing Acts\nof Parliament, which relate to independent states and international organisations, but not to\nterritories with special status.\nII The Bill\nThe Bill consists of just two clauses, and most of its substantive provisions are embodied in\nthe Schedule, which consists of eight numbered paragraphs.\nA. Clauses\n1. Clause 1 begins by setting out the scope of the Bill.\nSub-clause 1 provides that the Bill applies to any office established in the UK by the\nGovernment of the Hong Kong SAR and aimed at furthering its economic and trade interests.\nThis is a specific provision, which indicates that the British Government anticipates an\nexercise of autonomy in this area by the Hong Kong SAR. It does not relate to any office\nestablished by the Government of China, or through its representatives at the Chinese\nEmbassy, which would be covered by existing legislation.\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/96\nIt is also a limiting provision, since it relates solely to what may be defined as 'the purposes\nof furthering the economic and trade interests of the Region'.\nSub-clause 2 provides for the application of the Bill to an office established outside London\nonly at the discretion of the Secretary of State.\nThe Bill relates to an anticipated London office, hence this reservation of approval for further\noffices. This is not unusual, as consular law assumes a limited scope of operations for\nconsulates, known as 'consular posts', and it is common that these operate within a specified\nlocality.\nSub-clause 3 gives effect to the Schedule.\nSub-clause 4 provides a conclusive role for the Secretary of State in establishing the facts,\nshould a dispute arise as to whether or not a privilege or immunity envisaged in the Schedule\nactually applies in given circumstances.\n2. Clause 2 gives the short title, extends the provisions to Northern Ireland and makes the\nextension to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man discretionary.\nB. Schedule\nThe Schedule contains the substance of the Bill. Set out here are the precise privileges and\nimmunities which will be enjoyed by the premises and staff of the Hong Kong Economic and\nTrade Office.\nThese cover matters such as the inviolability of the premises and archives of the Office,\nimmunity from legal action for activities carried out in pursuance of official duties and certain\nexemptions and relief from tax and custom duties.\nNumbered paragraphs 4 and 5 set out most of the tax and duty exemptions1 and make them\nconditional on Orders to be made by the Treasury.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 The other exemption is made indirectly in numbered paragraph 2 of the Schedule, which exempts the premises\nof the Office and the residence of the Head of the Office from taxation, whether national or municipal, by means\nof a reference to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/96\nA definition of terms is provided in numbered paragraph 8 of the Schedule.\nC. Costs\nAccording to the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum printed with the Bill, the cost of\nthe envisaged relief from taxes and duties is expected to be less than £1m per annum, and\nthere will be no significant effect in terms of labour costs. There are no compliance costs for\nbusiness.\nIII Context\nA. Why Legislate?\nThe law on consular privileges and immunities is governed by three sets of documents. The\nVienna Convention on Consular Relations of 19632 expresses the general international law\non consuls.3 The UK is a party to the Convention, as is China. The Consular Relations Act\n1968 implements certain aspects of this in British law. Some aspects of the Act are further\nsubject to Orders in Council in specific cases.\nThe actual privileges and immunities envisaged for the Hong Kong Economic and Trade\nOffice are modelled not only on those contained in the Consular Relations Act 1968, but also\nin part on those contained in the International Organisations Act 1968.4\nBoth the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Consular Relations Act 1968 use\nlanguage which assumes that the consular post is established by an independent State, known\nas the 'sending State' or 'appointing State', which is responsible for posting or locally\ncontracting the Head, the officers and the staff of the consular post, known as its 'members'.\nIn the case of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, there will be no sending State, as\nthe Hong Kong SAR will not be sovereign. It is not unprecedented for regions other than\nsovereign states to send consuls: under the 1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union each of the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n2 Cmnd 5219.\n3 Older customary law and bilateral consular conventions continue to have a role complementary to the Convention.\nA useful commentary is Consular Law and Practice, L Lee, 1991.\n4 These are found in numbered paragraphs 4(b) and 5(c) of the Schedule and relate to relief from duties and\nexemption from other restrictions on the importation of hydrocarbon oil and motor vehicles. The International\nOrganisations Act 1968 relates to the privileges and immunities of representatives of such organisations.\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/96\nRepublics had the right to enter consular relations with foreign states,5 and some did so.\nHowever, existing British legislation contains no general provisions for such cases.\nThe Joint Declaration, which sets out the basis for Hong Kong's special status from 1 July\n1997, provides the Hong Kong SAR with some elements of international legal personality:\nusing the name of 'Hong Kong, China', the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\nmay on its own maintain and develop economic and cultural relations and conclude\nrelevant agreements with states, regions and relevant international organisations.6\nWithout specific provision in British law, there might be difficulties for the Hong Kong SAR\nto act for itself in this way in the UK. It is on this ground that the current Bill is considered\nnecessary.\nIn addition, the Bill reflects the distinction between Hong Kong as a part of China and the\nHong Kong SAR as an autonomous entity, and in so doing it achieves a political end. The\nautonomous rights which the Hong Kong SAR will enjoy under Article 3(10) of the Joint\nDeclaration, as quoted above, will be anticipated and therefore may be less likely to be\noverlooked for any reason. In particular, the inviolability of premises is regarded as\nemphasising this autonomy from China.\nOther Governments, including those of Canada and Australia, have made similar provision\nalready, and the British Government considers it appropriate that the UK should avoid giving\nany impression that its practical support for the new arrangements in Hong Kong is\noutstripped abroad.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 Oppenheim's International Law, 9th ed, 1992, s542 fn 2. This is not an exact parallel with Hong Kong, as each\nof the Soviet Republics enjoyed a degree of formal sovereignty, notwithstanding the realities of their situation.\n6 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, Cmnd 9543, 19 December 1984, Article 3(10).\nThis is reflected in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of\nChina, adopted 4 April 1990, which entrenches the constitutional basis for the Hong Kong SAR in Chinese law,\nunder Articles 151 and 156.\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/96\nB. Why Consular?\nThe Bill is couched in terms of consular relations, and this is in distinction to diplomatic\nrelations.\nThe Office will not have diplomatic status and neither will its members. Diplomatic status\nis of a higher order than consular status and is governed by separate instruments. The Hong\nKong Economic and Trade Office will be regarded as a consular post because of its restriction\nto economic and trade matters: diplomacy is based on a broader political representation of the\nsending State.\nThe use of consular status is necessitated also by the autonomous, rather than independent,\nnature of the Hong Kong SAR. As China will have sovereignty over the Hong Kong SAR\nand will retain responsibility for its foreign affairs,7 only China could appoint diplomats in\nrespect of the Hong Kong SAR.8\nC. The Current Position\nThe commercial interests of Hong Kong are promoted currently by the Hong Kong\nGovernment Office in London. This Office has a wide range of other functions as well, and\nis akin more to an Embassy or High Commission than it is to a trade consulate. It enjoys\ncertain non-statutory privileges as the representative office of a British dependent territory.\nIt is intended that this Office will cease its wider political functions from 1 July 1997 and will\ntake on the role of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office envisaged in the Bill.\nHowever, at that point, the Office will no longer represent a British dependent territory and\nwill thus lose its existing privileges: instead, the provisions of the Bill will come into force.\nHong Kong has Economic and Trade Offices in a number of countries at present, the majority\nof which have been separated from the British Embassies and High Commissions in those\ncountries. These Offices have lost their privileges and immunities on separation: it is the\nnegotiation of new privileges and immunities in these cases that has led to the early action\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n7 Joint Declaration, Article 3(2).\n8 An officer might be lodged at the Chinese Embassy, for instance, with special responsibility for Hong Kong\nmatters. This would be a diplomatic representative of China, however, and would act on behalf of the\nGovernment of the People's Republic, rather than on behalf of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR.\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/96\nof the Canadian and Australian Governments, and others seem happy to follow suit once\nlegislative time can be found.9\nD. Precedent?\nThe Bill makes explicit mention throughout of Hong Kong. It is not a measure of generic\napplication, in contrast to the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964, the Consular Relations Act\n1968 or the International Organisations Act 1968. It does not provide a régime under which\nany non-sovereign territory may be accorded consular relations, with the privileges and\nimmunities that implies. Whatever political precedent it may or may not be felt to set, its\nlegal scope is limited to the Hong Kong SAR alone.\nIt is possible that more generally worded legislation might raise concerns in Beijing over its\npossible application to Taiwan. It has been a matter of controversy that the representatives\nof Taiwan do not enjoy privileges and immunities in the UK. The Foreign Affairs\nCommittee's 1994 report on relations between the UK and China mentioned concerns to this\neffect raised by the Taipei Representative in London. These suggested that the granting of\npartial, and in some cases full, diplomatic privileges and immunities to the representatives of\nTaiwan by other OECD countries, notably the USA and Japan, provided a contrast with the\nBritish position which the Government should seek to address.10\nThe report argued:\nDespite the absence of formal recognition, the UK enjoys a friendly relationship and\nincreasing economic cooperation with Taiwan. It is not in the interests of the UK to\nsubject its representatives to unnecessary inconvenience, or to impede their work in\nthe UK. Whilst not wishing to recommend any changes which might unilaterally\naffect the status of Taiwan in international law we recommend that the Government\nreview the status of the Taiwanese Representative Office in the UK, and that a\nrelaxation of restrictions should be undertaken wherever that is consonant with British\nlaw.11\nThe Government argues that there is no basis in British law from which to extend any\nprivileges or immunities, since the Taipei Representative Office in the UK has the same status\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n9 Hong Kong also participates in international trade organisations in its own right, including the World Trade\nOrganisation and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.\n10 Relations Between the United Kingdom and China In the Period Up To and Beyond 1997, HC 37 1993-94, 23\nMarch 1994, para 74.\n11 Ibid., para 75. The final sentence was reproduced in the list of recommendations at the end of the report.\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/96\nas a private company or institution,12 but that it makes 'every effort to minimise any practical\ninconveniences that they may face'.13\nA change in the status of Taiwan that might create a basis for an extension of recognition,\nand thereby of diplomatic or consular relations, could lead to legislation that would follow\nthe precedent of the current Bill.\nIV Conclusion\nThe Bill reflects a desire to entrench the important relationship with Hong Kong from 1 July\n1997.\nIt is considered necessary to legislate as there is no basis in existing law from which to extend\nconsular status to representatives of the Hong Kong SAR.\nIn so doing, the Government seeks to provide certain practical benefits, covering operational\nissues such as tax and duty exemptions as well as security issues such as the inviolability of\npremises and archives. It is hoped that this will all contribute to preserving the interests of\nHong Kong and to forwarding its trade relationship with the UK.\nAt the same time an indication is given that the British Government wishes the autonomy to\nbe upheld for which Article 3(10) of the Joint Declaration provides, and that it will take steps\nto facilitate the exercise of that autonomy.\nThe Bill may also be seen as providing support for the wider autonomy conferred on the\nHong Kong SAR under the legend 'one country, two systems'.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12 Ibid., para 74.

This power, known as a\n\"hospital direction\", would enable courts both to sentence offenders suffering from mental\ndisorder (as defined in the Mental Health Act 1983) to prison, and at the same time to direct\nthat they should be detained in hospital for medical treatment connected with their disorder.\nClauses 5-10 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill introduce similar provisions for\nScotland.\nAlthough the proposals are similar in both jurisdictions, the structure of mental health\nlegislation differs between England and Scotland. For the sake of clarity, this paper is\ntherefore divided into two parts, the first dealing with the English and Welsh provisions and\nthe second with the Scottish. \n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nII England and Wales\nA. Introduction\nAt present, courts have two main choices when dealing with offenders who are suffering from\na mental disorder, as defined in the Mental Health Act 1983, that is from \"mental illness,\narrested or incomplete development of mind, psychopathic disorder and any other disorder or\ndisability of mind\". They can either decide that the offender is \"mad\" and therefore in need\nof treatment, or \"bad\" and deserve to be punished. In the first case, the offender may be\ndetained in hospital for treatment under the Mental Health Act 1983; in the second they will\nbe sent to prison. While it is possible for prisoners to be transferred from prison to hospital\nfor treatment, the courts cannot stipulate this in advance when sentencing an offender to a\nprison term. The Government is now proposing a new \"hybrid order\", under which the court\ncould both set a sentence and require the patient to be detained for treatment in a hospital,\nthus combining the principles of punishment and treatment in one disposal.\nB. Current provisions\n1. Hospital and restriction orders\nUnder section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983, a court can send a mentally disordered\noffender to hospital through a \"hospital order\" for any offence, apart from one with a fixed\npenalty (in practice, murder), as long as a number of conditions are met:\n the offender must have been convicted of the offence (or magistrates must be satisfied\nthat s/he was guilty); and\n two doctors, of whom one must be \"approved\" (ie a specialist in mental health), must\nstate that the individual is suffering from mental illness, psychopathic disorder, severe\nmental impairment or mental impairment; and\n the disorder must be \"of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be\ndetained in a hospital for medical treatment\"; and\n in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment the treatment should be\nlikely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the condition; and\n a bed must actually be available in the hospital in question within the next 28 days.\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nOffenders detained under a hospital order effectively pass out of the penal system into the\nhospital system and their position is very similar to that of \"civil\" (non-offender) patients:\nafter six months they must be released unless the authority to detain is renewed; the doctor\nresponsible for their care (their responsible medical officer or RMO) or the hospital managers\nmay discharge them at any point; and if their detention is renewed after six months they may\napply to the Mental Health Review Tribunal for their case to be reviewed. The penal system\nhas no further say in their disposal.\n\"Restriction orders\" under section 41 of the 1983 Act, on the other hand, can be imposed on\ntop of an ordinary hospital order by a court, either for a definite period of time or for an\nunlimited period. While the person is a restricted patient, they cannot be discharged,\ntransferred to another hospital or given leave of absence by the RMO without the Home\nSecretary's permission. The evidence required for restriction orders is the same as for hospital\norders and the court must be satisfied that the restrictions are necessary for the protection of\nthe public. The authority to detain the patient lasts until the restriction order has been lifted,\nor the Home Secretary has agreed to discharge; there is no need for regular renewal as there\nis under the civil detention procedures or under a non-restricted hospital order. A patient\nmight therefore be detained indefinitely under a restriction order. \nHowever, a restricted patient still has the right to apply to a Mental Health Review Tribunal\nto have their detention renewed; they may do this once in the second six months of their first\nyear's detention, and once in any subsequent year of detention. If the Tribunal is satisfied\neither that the patient is not suffering from mental illness, psychopathic disorder, severe\nmental impairment or mental impairment to the extent that detention in hospital for treatment\nis appropriate, or that such treatment is not necessary for the health and safety of the patient\nor the protection of other people, it must order the patient's discharge, either absolutely or\nwith conditions (s.73). The conditions imposed on the patient are at the discretion of the\nTribunal, but usually require the patient to live in a particular place, accept supervision and\nattend for medical treatment (though they cannot be forced to accept treatment). Where the\npatient is discharged under conditions, then they may be recalled by the Secretary of State at\nany time; however, where they are discharged absolutely, there is no further provision for\nrecall.\n2. Transfer and restriction directions \nUnder section 47 of the 1983 Act, the Home Secretary may order convicted prisoners to be\ntransferred from prison to hospital if they are suffering from mental illness, psychopathic\ndisorder, severe mental impairment or mental impairment and if their disorder is of a nature\nor degree where hospital treatment would be appropriate. Where the prisoner is suffering from\npsychopathic disorder or mental impairment, then the transfer can only take place if the\ntreatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the condition. Such a transfer\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\ndirection has the same effect as a hospital order and, again, unless the order is subject to\nrestrictions, effectively the person passes from the penal system to the healthcare system. The\ndetention can only last 6 months, unless the conditions for renewal are satisfied, and the RMO\nor hospital managers may discharge the patient at any time. \nHowever, most transfers under section 47 are also accompanied by restrictions under section\n49 of the 1983 Act. Where a patient is transferred in this way under a \"restriction direction\",\nthen the patient cannot be discharged by the RMO or hospital managers, transferred to another\nhospital, or granted leave of absence without the permission of the Home Secretary. The\nauthority to detain the patient lasts for as long as the restriction direction is in force; however\nthe restriction direction ceases to have effect once the term of the person's original sentence\n(including any remission) has expired (s.50). Once the restrictions have lapsed, then the\ndetained patient is in the same position as some-one transferred without restrictions (as\ndescribed above) and hence can be discharged at any time.\nUnder sections 42 & 49 of the 1983 Act, the Secretary of State is able to lift the restrictions,\ndischarge the patient from hospital with conditions, or discharge the patient absolutely. If a\npatient is discharged conditionally, then they can be recalled to hospital at any time while the\nrestriction order is still in force. The RMO of a patient subject to restrictions must submit a\nreport at least every year to the Home Secretary so that the latter is informed about the\ncondition of the patient. If the RMO or any other registered medical practitioner notifies the\nHome Secretary that the patient no longer needs hospital treatment for their mental disorder,\nbut their original term of sentence is not yet expired, then the Home Secretary can return the\nperson to prison or use powers to release them on licence or discharge them under supervision\nin the same way as if the person had never been transferred from prison in the first place\n(s.50).\nUnder section 70 of the 1983 Act, patients under a restriction direction are also able to apply\nto the Mental Health Review Tribunal in the same way as those under a restriction order. If\nthe Tribunal is satisfied either that the patient is not suffering from mental disorder to the\nextent that detention in hospital for treatment is appropriate, or that such treatment is not\nnecessary for the health and safety of the patient or other people, then it must notify the\nHome Secretary. The Home Secretary then has the option of returning the patient to prison\nto complete the rest of their sentence, continuing to detain them in hospital (if the tribunal\nrecommends this as preferable to prison) or permitting the tribunal to grant an absolute or\nconditional discharge (ss 73 & 74).\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nC. Proposals for change\n1. The working group on psychopathic disorder\nThe idea of a form of \"hybrid order\" combining a prison sentence and a hospital order was\nput forward in 1994 by a Home Office working group on psychopathic disorder chaired by\nDr. John Reed (the \"Reed report\").1 The group's report included a section commenting on the\nproblems arising with both hospital orders and transfer directions for those suffering from\npsychopathic disorder. Given both the lack of agreement as to what constitutes psychopathic\ndisorder and the lack of evidence as to whether or not it is treatable, the working group felt\nthat it was \"illogical and naive\" for the courts routinely to send such offenders to hospital\nunder hospital orders on the assumption that they would be successfully treated and would\nnot be discharged until they no longer represented a risk. The psychiatric profession was also\nincreasingly concerned about the indeterminacy of these orders, and felt that transfer from\nprison to hospital after sentence was more appropriate, \"enabl[ing] the courts to impose the\nappropriate tariff for the offence\". At the same time the working group raised the problem of\nthe \"uncertainties and complications\" which sometimes arose over the transfer from prison to\nhospital under sections 47 & 49 of the 1983 Act and which could lead to delay in offenders\nreceiving the treatment they needed. \nA hybrid order could be seen as a way round both these problems: a specific sentence would\nbe set, appropriate to the offence, but hospital treatment would be immediately available,\navoiding the need for administrative action to transfer the prisoner from prison after sentence.\nThe report emphasised that there need be no automatic assumption that the patient would be\nremitted to prison; if they responded to treatment then they could move through the hospital\nsystem and be discharged from hospital either on their release date or possibly earlier.\nHowever, if the offender did not respond to treatment, there would then be the option of\nsending them to prison to serve the remainder of their sentence, instead of continuing to\ndetain them in hospital with little hope of improvement, or of discharging them while still a\npossible risk to the public.\nThe working party went on to cite both the advantages and disadvantages they foresaw in\nsuch an order. The advantages included:\n consistency with the Government policy that mentally disordered offenders should be\ntreated in the health care system wherever possible;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1Dept of Health/Home Office, Report of the Department of Health and Home Office working group on psychopathic\ndisorder, 1994\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\n overcoming psychiatrists' concerns about being left with a potentially dangerous\npatient for whom further treatment would be useless, but whose discharge could lead\nto dangers to public safety;\n the possibility that the availability of such an order would lead to greater consistency\nin placing psychopathically disordered offenders;\n the fact that it reflected the current state of knowledge of psychopathy and would\nprovide a flexible framework for treatment;\n no greater risk to the public than current provisions.\nThe disadvantages included:\n the lack of certainty in the order which could cause difficulties in hospital treatment;\n the view that it was wrong to treat offenders with psychopathic disorder differently\nfrom other mentally disordered offenders, especially given difficulties of diagnosis;\n inconsistency with current sentencing practice whereby an offender convicted of a\nserious offence who was judged to be dangerous on account of their mental state was\nlikely to receive a life sentence;\n the view that current arrangements for the health and social care of restricted patients\nafter discharge provided effective controls and safeguards.\nWhile some members of the working group raised concerns over both the principles and\npracticalities of a hybrid order, the great majority concluded that there was \"considerable\nmerit\" in the idea of such an order and recommended that the proposal be discussed more\nwidely.\n2. The Home Office and Department of Health discussion paper\nOn 3 May 1996, the Home Office and the Department of Health published a joint discussion\npaper, Mentally disordered offenders: sentencing and discharge arrangements, taking up the\nsuggestion of a hybrid order. In addition to the current options of a hospital order or a prison\nsentence, courts would in future be able to choose to make a \"hospital direction\", combining\nboth an immediate direction to hospital with a prison sentence. The offender would therefore\nbe sent directly to hospital, where they would remain either until the end of their sentence,\nor until such time as treatment was no longer needed or was no longer effective. Where\ntreatment was deemed to be no longer necessary or effective, then the offender could be\nremitted to prison to serve the remainder of their sentence there. The discussion document\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nenvisaged that while in hospital, the same arrangements for review of detention and\napplication to a Mental Health Review Tribunal would apply as for those transferred from\nprison. Such an order would be different from a hospital order in that the courts could both\nspecify hospital treatment and at the same time ensure that there was a punitive element \"to\nreflect the offender's whole or partial responsibility\"; it would also differ from a transfer\ndirection in that the offender could receive treatment in hospital straight away without the\nneed for administrative action to arrange the transfer from prison. In the press notice\nannouncing the discussion paper's publication, Home Office Minister Ann Widdecombe MP\nsummarised the rationale behind the proposals as follows:\n\"The public has a right to expect to be protected from dangerous offenders.\nThese proposals will increase that protection.\nFor the first time courts would be able to pass a prison sentence at the same\ntime as directing treatment in hospital. The power would be used in cases\nwhere the offender had significant responsibility for the crimes committed, or\nwhere the danger posed was not solely related to mental disorder.\"2\nThese proposals differ in some important respects from those made by the working party\nchaired by Dr. Reed. While the latter related solely to psychopathic disorder (with its\nassociated issue of treatability), the discussion paper suggests that a hospital direction should\nbe available for all categories of mental disorder covered by the 1983 Act, that is mental\nillness, mental impairment, psychopathic disorder and severe mental impairment. While\nacknowledging that questions of \"treatability\" rarely arise in these other forms of mental\ndisorder, the Government felt it would be inappropriate for the availability of a hybrid order\nto be dependent on a diagnosis of psychopathic disorder, especially since the borderline\nbetween the legal categories of mental disorder are often felt to be unclear and diagnosis may\nvary from doctor to doctor. The discussion paper goes on to suggest that the courts are well\nplaced to make the necessary judgements about responsibility, rehabilitation and risk, and\nshould be given the freedom to make the most appropriate disposal in individual cases.\nAnother difference between the discussion paper and the Reed report is the former's focus on\nthe need for a punitive element in the disposal of a mentally disordered offender; the main\nrationale behind the Reed report, on the other hand, appears to have been the problem of\ndealing with psychopathic offenders for whom hospital could not necessarily provide a \"cure\".\nIndeed, the Reed report suggested that patients detained under a hospital direction who\nresponded to treatment could be discharged even before their release date, while in the\ndiscussion paper the assumption appears to be that such offenders would be remitted to prison\nto complete their sentence.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n2Home Office press notice 130/96, 3 May 1996\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\n3. Interim hospital orders\nIn addition to the proposals on hospital directions, the discussion paper also suggested that\nthe maximum period for \"interim hospital orders\" under section 38 of the 1983 Act should\nbe extended from 6 months to 12 months. Under existing provisions, convicted offenders may\nbe sent to hospital by courts under these interim orders, in order to give doctors the\nopportunity to assess whether a full hospital order would be appropriate. The Reed working\ngroup had suggested that the maximum 6 month period should be extended in order to allow\nfor a fuller assessment of offenders' treatment needs, and this proposal was taken up in the\ndiscussion paper.3\nD. The Bill\nThe Crime (Sentences) Bill4 was introduced into the Commons on 24 October 1996. Clauses\n36-39 would effect, with some amendments, the proposals for hospital directions and interim\nhospital orders made in the discussion paper.\n \nClause 36 of the Bill would insert a new section 45A in the Mental Health Act 1983, giving\nCrown Courts the power to give \"hospital directions\" and \"limitation directions\" to convicted\noffenders. Under a hospital direction, the offender, instead of being detained in prison for the\nperiod of their sentence, may instead be detained in hospital; the limitation direction will\nensure that all the restrictions set out in section 41 of the 1983 Act also apply so that the\noffender may not be discharged, transferred to another hospital or given leave of absence by\ntheir responsible medical officer without the Home Secretary's permission. This use of two\ndirections (one to send the offender to hospital and one to impose restrictions) mirrors the\nstructure of restricted hospital orders and restricted transfer directions elsewhere in the 1983\nAct; however, the combined effect of both orders is the same as that proposed in the\ndiscussion paper under the single name \"hospital direction\".\nSection 45B, also inserted by clause 36 of the Bill, then states that a hospital direction would\nhave the same effect as a transfer direction and a limitation direction the same effect as a\nrestriction direction (see above, pp 7-8). In other words, although the offender is being sent\nstraight to a hospital, rather than to prison, once in the hospital they are treated as if they had\nbeen transferred from prison, and if treatment is found no longer to be effective they can be\nremitted back to prison to complete their sentence. All the provisions in the 1983 Act\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3Dept of Health/Home Office, op.cit. para 10.29\n4Bill 3 of 1996/97\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\ncovering prisoners transferred from prison to hospital under transfer and restriction directions\nwould also apply to prisoners detained in hospital under hospital and limitation directions.\nCourts will be able to make hospital and limitation directions in the following circumstances:\n the offender has been convicted in a Crown Court of an offence for which the\nsentence is not fixed by law (s.45A(1)); and\n the court has considered the possibility of making an hospital order, before deciding\ninstead to impose a sentence of imprisonment (with the exception of offences covered\nby clause 1 of this Bill, that is second serious sexual or violent offences, where this\nrequirement need not be met); and\n the offender is suffering from psychopathic disorder (s.45A(2)); and\n the mental disorder is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for them to be\ndetained in hospital for medical treatment; and\n such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of their condition.\nAt least two registered medical practitioners must give evidence to the court on the medical\ncriteria above, and at least one of these practitioners must give this evidence orally before the\ncourt (ss 45A(2) & 45A(4)). Moreover, the court must be satisfied that a bed in the hospital\nnamed in the direction must be available within the next 28 days (s.45A(5)). If during the\nfollowing 28 days it becomes impracticable for the patient to be admitted to the named\nhospital, then the Secretary of State has the power to give instructions for them to be admitted\nto another appropriate hospital instead (ss 45A(6) &(7)). Existing powers under the 1983 Act\nto impose interim hospital orders on offenders (to enable an assessment of their condition to\nbe made) and to require information from Health Authorities on the availability of suitable\nbeds also apply to hospital and limitation directions (s.45A(8)). Hospital and limitation\ndirections may also be applied in connection with other sentences of imprisonment imposed\non the same or a previous occasion (s.45A(9)).\nAlthough the above amendments to the 1983 Act refer only to psychopathic disorder and not\nto other forms of mental disorder, ss 45A(10) & (11) would give the Secretary of State the\npower to make an order extending these provisions to other forms of mental disorder; the\norder could include such \"supplementary, incidental or consequential provisions as appear to\nthe Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient\". \nClause 37 would amend the 1983 Act to give the courts the power, in certain circumstances,\nto specify not only the hospital to which an offender should be sent, but also the unit within\nthe hospital. The clause would apply to restricted hospital orders under sections 37 & 41 of\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nthe 1983 Act, to hospital and limitation directions under section 45A of the 1983 Act, to\nrestricted transfer directions under sections 47 & 49 of the 1983 Act and to orders for\nadmission to hospital under paragraphs 1 & 2(1)(b) of Schedule 1 to the Criminal Procedure\n(Insanity and Fitness to Plead) Act 1991.\nClause 38 would bring into effect Schedule 3; this Schedule would make amendments to the\n1983 Act and to the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 to enable prisoners who have been\nconditionally discharged after a restriction direction or restriction order to be transferred\nbetween England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands and Isle of\nMan.\nClause 39 makes a number of further amendments to the 1983 Act. Section 38(5) of the 1983\nAct would be amended so that the maximum period for interim hospital orders (which enable\ncourts to send offenders to hospital in order to assess whether a full hospital order would be\nappropriate) would be extended from 6 months to 12 months (clause 39(1)). Restricted\npatients may not be transferred between different hospitals managed by the same NHS trust\nor Special Health authority, without the permission of the Home Secretary (clauses 39(2) &\n(4)). \nFinancial effects of the Bill\nThe Bill's explanatory memorandum states that in the first \"phase\" of hospital directions,\nwhen they are available only for those suffering from psychopathic disorder, any additional\ncosts for the NHS \"will be contained within existing resources\". Before an order is introduced\nto extend the power to other forms of disorder, an assessment of the costs will be made with\nthe Department of Health. The NHS Trust Federation was reported in the Health Service\nJournal as being concerned about the possible financial impact on the NHS, with an estimate\nof £48 million a year in additional costs.5 The BMA raised similar concerns in its response\nto the discussion paper, estimating that each place could cost the NHS upwards of £70,000\na year.6\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5\n\"Trusts attack £48m cost of Home Office prison plans\", Health Service Journal, 27 June 1996 p.10\n6BMA, letter to Home Office in response to the discussion paper, dated 1 July 1996\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nE. Comment\n1. In Parliament\nThe proposals have been welcomed by the Labour Party; Jack Straw MP, speaking in the\nFourth Day Debate on the Queen's Speech stated that: \n\"We support other proposals in the Bill, including ... a new and long overdue\nprovision for mentally disordered offenders.\"7\nThe Liberal Democrats did not make specific reference to this part of the Bill in the debate.\n2. Voluntary organisations \nA number of organisations representing mentally ill people have expressed concerns over the\nprinciple of hospital directions, as set out in the discussion paper. The organisations SANE\n(Schizophrenia - A National Emergency), MIND (the National Association for Mental Health)\nand NSF (the National Schizophrenia Fellowship) all raised concerns over the principle of\nregarding people as \"culpable\" for actions committed when suffering from psychosis or when\nunable to exercise ordinary control over their behaviour. SANE, for example, states that \"a\nhumane society should not move towards attributing culpability to those who are victims of\nmental illness\",8 while NSF suggests that a wider debate is needed on notions of culpability\nand the need for punishment for offenders who may be mentally ill.9 MIND's paper setting\nout its initial views on the discussion document similarly states that while it does not\nnecessarily follow from the fact that someone suffers from \"mental disorder\" that they are not\nresponsible for their actions, there may well be cases where this is so.10 It goes on to express\nconcern that decisions about the defendant's responsibility for their actions will be made by\nthe judge, suggesting that a fairer system would be for such a judgement to be made at the\ntrial and not at the sentencing stage. The Law Commission, for example, had suggested that\na new defence of \"not guilty on evidence of mental disorder\" could be returned where at the\ntime of the act the defendant was suffering from severe mental illness or severe mental\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n7HC Deb 28 October 1996 cc 353-4\n8SANE, Summary of SANE's policy on the White Paper proposals on the introduction of hybrid orders, n.d.\n9NSF press notice, 3 May 1996\n10MIND, Mentally disordered offenders: sentencing and discharge arrangements: MIND's views on the joint Home\nOffice and Department of Health discussion paper on a proposed new power for the courts, n.d.\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nhandicap.11 Both MIND and NSF go on to suggest a number of alternative ways current\nprovision could be improved: for example through a greater emphasis on prevention through\nbetter community support, more emphasis on court diversion schemes and, for those whose\ndangerous behaviour is not linked with mental disorder, improved care and medical treatment\nin prison.\nSANE, MIND and NSF also express grave concerns over the therapeutic effect on the\noffender of knowing that once they were \"cured\" they could be remitted to prison, rather than\nreleased. They argue that this is cruel for the patient, is likely to cause difficulties for the\nprofessionals working with offenders, and may lead to a \"revolving door\" scenario where\noffenders improve in hospital, are remitted to prison, relapse and have to transferred back to\nhospital again.12 MIND also argues that the proposals appear to be based on a\nmisunderstanding of the scope of the powers already in existence. One reason given in the\ndiscussion document for the new power is that present powers are insufficiently flexible to\ncope with cases where the offender is in need of treatment but where it is not certain that\nsuch treatment will sufficiently address the risk to the public posed by the defendant. MIND\nrejects this view, claiming that if what is meant by inadequate protection of the public is a\nlack of security in psychiatric hospitals, then the new hospital direction will add nothing; if,\non the other hand, the discussion document is referring to offenders being a danger after\nrelease, then it is MIND's view that restriction orders under sections 37 & 41 of the Act are\nmore than adequate to protect the public. MIND goes on to argue that a few cases where\ndecisions to discharge patients from restriction orders have, with hindsight, been seen to be\nbad decisions should not be used to give a false impression of the existing powers; in fact a\nrestriction order may be \"similar in effect to and no less punitive than a discretionary life\nsentence\". It is suggested that, in practice, offenders under hospital orders often spend longer\nin hospital than they would have done in prison and may even prefer the prison regime to that\nin a psychiatric hospital. \nSANE further raises the issue of \"treatability\", stating that it does not subscribe to the\nargument that psychopathic disorders are \"untreatable\" and that further research should be\ndirected towards forms of treatment for this condition.\nFinally, NSF and MIND raise the practical issue of the availability of suitable hospital places;\nnew legislative provisions are meaningless if the beds presupposed by the legislation are not\navailable. There is certainly regular press coverage of the difficulties experienced by doctors\nattempting to find in-patient beds for mental health patients; the Independent, for example,\nreported very recently how six mental health patients, five of whom were considered to be\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n11Law Commission, Draft Criminal Code Bill, clause 35(1), Law Com.

This in turn blocks admission for new patients in need of the security\nprovided in Special Hospitals. The report went on to announce changes in the structure of the\nSpecial Hospital service to encourage closer links and easier transfers between different levels\nof secure provision.\n3. Professional bodies\nIn response to the discussion paper, the British Medical Association made a number of\nsuggestions and comments on the detail of the proposed hospital directions, but made no\nobjections to the principle behind them. It also supported the view that hospital directions\nshould be available for offenders suffering from categories of mental disorder other than\npsychopathic disorder, on the grounds that mental illness may accompanied by unrelated\noffending behaviour \"which is unresponsive to treatment and so requires separate handling of\nthat behaviour\".18 On the negative side, the BMA expressed concern as to the suitability of\ndetaining those who had committed a second serious sexual or violent offence in hospital. It\nalso emphasised the need for adequate funding of hospitals, whether regional secure units,\nordinary NHS units or private forensic hospitals, coping with the additional referrals as a\nresult of hospital directions.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n13\n\"Violent patients turned away by full-up hospitals\", The Independent, 25 October 1996 p.4\n14Royal College of Psychiatrists, Monitoring inner London mental illness services, 19 April 1995\n15Mental Health Act Commission, Sixth Biennial Report 1993-1995 p.97\n16eg \"QC to argue Bottomley's bed case\", The Independent, 9 February 1995 p.11 & \"Bottomley takes on judges over\nsummonses\", The Independent, 14 February 1995 p.8\n17Dept of Health, High security psychiatric services: changes in funding and organisation, June 1995\n18BMA, letter to Home Office in response to the discussion paper, dated 1 July 1996\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nThe Royal College of Nursing, on the other hand, believes that the principle of hospital\ndirections is in conflict with the therapeutic aims of hospital treatment. In its response to the\nBill,19 it states that where an offence has been committed as the result of mental illness, then\nthe aim should be to treat the offender, focussing on the possibility of a return to living in the\ncommunity. Returning such a patient to prison would \"only undermine the clinical and\nfinancial investment that will have been made in the person during their period of inpatient\nhospital treatment\". \n4. General comments\nAccording to Baroness Blatch, Minister of State in the Home Office, 182 responses to the\ndiscussion paper were received.20 102 expressed support for the principle of a hospital\ndirection; of these 24 felt that the power should be restricted to those diagnosed as suffering\nfrom psychopathic disorder. There was also \"broad support\" for the extension of interim\nhospital orders from 6 months to 12 months.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n19RCN, Parliamentary Briefing 30 October 1996\n20HL Deb 28 October 1996 cc 9-10WA\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nIII Scotland\nA. Introduction\nUnder current provisions in the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 and the Criminal\nProcedure (Scotland) Act 1995, there are two main ways in which a court can deal with a\nconvicted defendant suffering from mental disorder. Either the offender may be sent to\nhospital under a \"hospital order\" on the grounds that they are unwell and need treatment\nrather than punishment (s.58 of the 1995 Act), or they may be sent to prison. Once in prison,\nthey may later be transferred to hospital under a \"transfer direction\" (s.71 of the 1984 Act),\nbut the court is not empowered to specify this when sentencing. Current practice could thus\nbe seen as classifying people as either \"mad\" or \"bad\" and sentencing accordingly (although\nit has also been argued that detention under the 1984 Act is certainly not experienced by\npatients as a soft option). The Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill21 which received its First\nReading on 25 October 1996 would make a new \"hybrid\" order available to the courts,\ncombining both elements of prison and hospital.\nB. Current provisions \n1. Hospital and restriction orders\nUnder section 58 of the 1995 Act, a court may send a mentally disordered offender to hospital\nfor any offence, apart from one with a fixed penalty (in practice, murder), as long as a\nnumber of conditions have been met. Firstly, the grounds for compulsory hospital admission\nset out in section 17(1) of the 1984 Act must be met: two doctors (one of whom must be\n\"approved\" as having special experience of mental disorder) must satisfy the court that the\noffender is suffering from mental disorder of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate\nfor them to receive medical treatment in hospital; where the mental disorder is either mental\nimpairment or \"a persistent [disorder] manifested only by abnormally aggressive or seriously\nirresponsible conduct\" then the treatment must be likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration\nof the offender's condition; and treatment in hospital must be necessary for the offender's own\nhealth and safety or the protection of others. In other words, detention in hospital must be\nlikely to lead to some improvement in the offender's mental condition and not simply consist\nof containment; it must also be necessary for the protection of either the offender or the\npublic. Secondly, the court must be satisfied that, given all the circumstances of the offence\nand the character of the offender, the most appropriate way of disposing of the case is by\nmeans of a hospital order. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n21Bill 5 of 1996/97\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nOnce a hospital order has been made, the offender is treated, with only minor modifications,\nas if they had been detained in hospital as a \"civil\" (that is, non-offender) patient, under\nsection 18 of the 1984 Act, and the penal system has no further say in their disposal. The\ndetention only lasts 6 months, unless the authority to detain is renewed, and they can be\ndischarged at any time by their responsible medical officer (RMO), the Mental Welfare\nCommission or, on appeal, by the sheriff. \nHowever, under section 59 of the 1995 Act and section 62 of the 1984 Act, it is also possible\nfor the court to make a \"restriction order\" in cases where it appears to the court that the\noffender might pose a serious danger to the public if released. Offenders detained in hospital\nunder a restriction order may not be transferred to another hospital or given leave of absence\nby the RMO without the permission of the Home Secretary, and only the Home Secretary or\nthe sheriff, on appeal, may order their discharge. There is no need for their detention to be\nperiodically renewed, as in civil detention: the order remains valid indefinitely until the\nSecretary of State lifts the restrictions (in which case the offender will continue to be detained\nas an \"ordinary\" hospital order patient) or absolute discharge is ordered by the sheriff or the\nSecretary of State. It is also possible for the Secretary of State or sheriff to order a\n\"conditional discharge\"; in this case, the patient, although discharged from hospital, remains\nliable to recall until given an absolute discharge.\n2. Transfer and restriction directions\nWhere offenders have been sentenced to imprisonment, section 71 of the 1984 Act permits\nthem to be transferred to hospital under a \"transfer direction\". The criteria for such a transfer\nare the same as for civil admission under section 17(1) of the 1984 Act (see above p.19), and\nthe decision to make the transfer is at the Secretary of State's discretion. A transfer direction\nhas the same effect as a hospital order and, as with an ordinary hospital order, would lead to\nthe offender passing out of the prison system into the healthcare system. However, most\ntransfer directions are accompanied by \"restriction directions\" which have the same effect as\nthe restriction orders described above. Moreover, although an offender under a restriction\ndirection still retains the right to appeal to the sheriff, the sheriff does not have the power to\norder their conditional or absolute discharge. Instead, the sheriff must notify the Secretary of\nState that, apart from the restriction direction, conditional or absolute discharge would be\nappropriate. The Secretary of State may then decide to return the offender to prison to\ncomplete their sentence or exercise any power to release them on licence or discharge them\nunder supervision as if they had never left prison. Where a conditional discharge would have\nbeen recommended, if the restriction direction were not in place, then the Secretary of State\nalso has the option of keeping the offender in hospital if this is seen as preferable to returning\nthem to prison.\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nC. Proposals for change\n1. Hospital directions\nThe recent Scottish Office White Paper on crime, Crime and Punishment,22 includes a section\non the powers available to courts when sentencing mentally disordered offenders. Describing\nthe current system of hospital orders and prison sentences as one of \"two extremes\", it\nproposes a additional option for those deemed fit to stand trial and found guilty, but who are\nalso sufficiently mentally ill to warrant hospitalisation at the point of sentencing. The White\nPaper emphasises that where a convicted offender has a genuine and enduring mental illness\nwhich can be treated in hospital and is the principal explanation or cause of the offending,\nthen a hospital order will continue to be the most appropriate disposal. However, taking into\naccount the seriousness of the offence, the offender's culpability and the need for public\nprotection, the courts would have the additional option of making a \"hospital direction\":\ncombining a prison sentence (either determinate or life) with an immediate order to hospital.\nSuch a direction would have the same effect on the offender as the current transfer direction\nwith restrictions (see p.20 above). The White Paper does not spell out precisely when it would\nexpect a hospital direction to be made, but by implication this would be when the offender\nwas deemed to be at least partially responsible for their actions and where therefore the court\nwished to impose punishment as well as treatment. \nA \"hybrid order\" of this kind, combining prison sentence with direction to hospital, was\nproposed by a joint Home Office and Department of Health working party in 1994, chaired\nby Dr. John Reed23 and brief reference to this proposal is made in the White Paper. However,\nthere are significant differences between the original recommendation and the legislative\nproposals for both England and Wales24 and Scotland. The working party's recommendations\nrelated only to those suffering from \"psychopathic disorder\", one form of mental disorder\ndefined in the English Mental Health Act 1983, but which is not defined in the Scottish\nlegislation. The Reed recommendations were based on concerns over the treatability of\npsychopathic disorder: there is currently little consensus either on what constitutes the disorder\nand how, or even if, it can be treated. Since a hospital order is predicated on the assumption\nthat the offender is ill, in need of treatment and may ultimately be cured, hospitals may be\nunwilling to accept psychopathically disordered patients if it seems unlikely that treatment will\nlead to a safe discharge. The rationale behind the proposals in Crime and Punishment, on the\nother hand, appears to be primarily that of the need for combining a punitive element with\na hospital order. This point is reinforced in the White Paper when it makes clear that\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n22Cm 3302, June 1996\n23Dept of Health/Home Office, Report of the Department of Health and Home Office working group on psychopathic\ndisorder, 1994\n24see Part II of this paper\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\noffenders would either stay in hospital until the end of their sentence, or would be remitted\nto prison to serve the remainder of their sentence if they responded to treatment.\n2. Interim hospital orders\nThe White Paper also suggests amendments to \"interim hospital orders\" under section 53 of\nthe 1995 Act. Under this section, a court may send an offender to hospital for up to six\nmonths in order for their treatment needs to be assessed and a judgement made as to their\nsuitability for a full hospital order. The proposal in the White Paper is that this maximum\nperiod should be extended to 12 months. The Reed working group had made the same\nsuggestion, on the basis that this would allow a fuller assessment of offenders' treatment\nneeds. \nD. The Bill\nThe proposals for a new \"hospital direction\" and the extension of interim hospital orders are\nincluded within the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill, which had its First Reading on 25\nOctober 1996.\nClause 5 of the Bill would amend the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (\"the 1995\nAct\") by inserting a new section 59A. Under this section, the High Court or a sheriff court\nwould have the power both to impose a sentence of imprisonment on an offender and at the\nsame time authorise their detention in hospital under a \"hospital direction\". In order for such\na direction to be made, two doctors (of whom one must be \"approved\" as having special\nexperience in mental disorder) must satisfy the court that the conditions for detention in\nhospital set out in section 17(1) of the Mental Health Act 1984 are met (see above, p.19);\nboth doctors must agree on the form of mental disorder from which the offender is suffering;\nand a bed must actually be available in the specified hospital within the next 28 days. \nClause 6 would insert a new section 62A in the Mental Health Act 1984 (\"the 1984 Act\"),\ndefining the effects of a hospital direction. Essentially an offender under a hospital direction\nwould be in the same position as a prisoner transfered from prison under a restriction\ndirection (see above p.20): the authority to detain would remain in force until either the\noffender was remitted to prison, or until their sentence had come to an end; and they could\nnot be transferred to another hospital or granted leave of absence without the permission of\nthe Secretary of State. Once the sentence had come to an end, the hospital direction would\nalso automatically lapse, but it would be possible for the offender to continue to be detained\nunder the civil procedures if the criteria for detention were still met. Offenders under hospital\ndirections would have the same right of appeal to a sheriff as patients under restriction\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\ndirections but, as with the latter, the sheriff would only be empowered to make a report to the\nSecretary of State and not to discharge them from hospital. The Secretary of State would then\ndecide whether to keep them in hospital, remit them to prison, or exercise any power of\nreleasing them on licence or discharging them under supervision which would have been\nexercisable if the offender had never left prison. This new section also makes provision for\ncases where it becomes impracticable for the hospital named in the direction to accept the\npatient within the requisite 28 days; the Secretary of State is empowered to specify an\nalternative suitable hospital.\nClause 7 removes the current restriction on the use of private hospitals for the detention of\nmentally ill remand prisoners.\nClause 8 gives a court, in certain circumstances, the power to specify not only the hospital\nto which the offender should be sent but also a unit within that hospital. This power applies\nonly to disposals in case of insanity under section 57 of the 1995 Act, restricted hospital\norders under sections 58 & 59 of the 1995 Act, hospital directions under section 59A of the\n1995 Act and restriction directions under section 71 & 72 of the 1984 Act. \nClause 9 amends section 61 of the 1995 Act, to require at least one of the medical\npractitioners providing evidence as to an offender's mental state to be employed at the hospital\nwhere the offender is to sent. This will apply where courts are considering interim hospital\norders, hospital orders, or hospital directions, and in cases where there is the possibility that\nthe trial cannot go ahead because of the defendant's insanity.\nClause 10 extends the maximum period for an interim hospital order under section 53 of the\n1995 Act from 6 months to 12 months.\nFinancial effects of the Bill\nAccording to the Bill's explanatory memorandum, the provisions concerning mentally\ndisordered offenders are expected to have a \"negligible\" financial effect, on the grounds that\nin virtually all cases offenders would otherwise have been detained in hospital under a\nhospital order or in custody with the possibility of a later transfer to hospital.\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/100\nE. Comment\nNo specific reference to the provisions of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill dealing\nwith mentally disordered offenders was made by Opposition parties during the debate on the\nQueen's speech. However, Jack Straw MP, speaking for the Labour Party, welcomed the\nequivalent measures for England and Wales.25 The Scottish Association for Mental Health\n(SAMH) expressed firm opposition to the principle of combining punishment with treatment,\nstating that if a person is mentally ill when they committed an offence, then the appropriate\nresponse is not retribution but treatment. SAMH went on to call for a comprehensive policy\nreview on the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders in Scotland, in line with\nthe similar review carried out in 1992 in England.26 At the time of writing, other comments\nhave not been received, although it seems likely that many of the comments on the English\nand Welsh provisions could also be applied to Scotland.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n25HC Deb 28 October 1996 cc 353-4\n26Department of Health & Home Office, Review of health and social services for mentally disordered offenders and\nothers requiring similar services, Cm 2088, November 1992\n24\n\n\nRecent Research Papers\n96/90 Defence Update 08.10.96\n96/91 Defence Statistics 1996 11.10.96\n96/92 Defence Employment 1994-95 11.10.96\n96/93 The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 15.10.96\n96/94 Parliamentary Election Timetables 15.10.96\n96/95 Unemployment by Constituency - September 1996 16.10.96\n96/96 Hong Kong Economic & Trade Office Bill (not yet printed)\n96/97 Economic Indicators 01.11.96\n96/98 The Local Government and Rating Bill 1996/97 [Bill 2 of 1996/97]:\nLocal Government in Rural Areas (not yet printed)\n96/99 The Crime (Sentences) Bill [Bill 3 of 1996-97] (not yet printed)\n\n\n\n"

Current Sentencing Guidance\nUnder current sentencing arrangements the sentence imposed on an offender in a particular\ncase is entirely a matter for the judge, although he or she must keep within such maximum\nsentences as may be set out in the statute for the particular offence concerned. The modern\nstructure of statutory maximum penalties of imprisonment originated in the consolidating\nstatutes of 1861 including the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. The penalties chosen\nat that time largely followed the periods previously chosen as fixed sentences for\ntransportation and were set too high to influence the daily practice of the courts. Maximum\npenalties are seen as having been designed to cater for the worst possible offence. They have\nhad little effect on the question of what should be the appropriate period of imprisonment\nfor the majority of cases which come before the courts. Instead a \"tariff\" has been established\nby the Court of Appeal, guiding judges on the range of penalties imposed for offences for\nwhich the statutory maximum penalties are high. This tariff is not to be found in any official\npublication, although D A Thomas' loose-leaf compendium Current Sentencing Practice can\nbe regarded as virtually authoritative.\nThe range of sentences set out in the tariff tends to be well below the statutory maximum for\na particular offence. Simple increases in the statutory maxima do not automatically lead to\nstiffer sentences being imposed in individual cases. This could only be done by the imposition\nof statutory minimum sentences. A number of other countries have these, but they have\ntended not to find favour here because of the extent to which they would take the sentencing\nprocess out of the hands of the judiciary. Many commentators have observed that minimum\nsentences would be likely to cause as many if not more injustices than they would cure, in\nthat they would reduce opportunities for judges and magistrates to take account of the\ncircumstances of individual cases and defendants when passing sentence. These commentators\noften point to the controversial introduction and subsequent repeal of the system of unit fines\ncreated under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 as an example of the problems which can arise\nwhen a system which reduces judicial discretion in sentencing matters is put into practice. \nCommentators also refer to the very large and still expanding prison population in the United\nStates as evidence of the potential cost, in human and financial terms, of the imposition of\nmeasures which reduce or remove judicial discretion. Mandatory sentencing guidelines have\nbeen introduced for prisoners convicted in the federal courts in the USA and parole has been\nabolished for federal prisoners. Mandatory sentencing guidelines have also been introduced\nin some states in the USA, and mandatory minimum sentences and automatic life sentences\nfor repeat offenders have also been introduced, most notoriously under the \"three strikes and\nyou're out\" provisions introduced in California. These measures have often been introduced\nwith the stated aims of ensuring greater consistency in sentencing and responding to public\nconcern about the very high levels of violent crime in the USA. Critics have stated that their\ninflexibility has resulted in consistency at the expense of justice, with large numbers of\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\noffenders receiving long sentences for small-scale drug dealing and other relatively minor\noffences, such as the offender reported as having been sentenced to life imprisonment for\nstealing a pizza under California's \"three strikes and you're out\" law. It has been argued that\nthe \"three strikes\" provisions have caused serious backlogs and delays in the criminal justice\nsystem, with fewer offenders pleading guilty or participating in plea-bargaining. It has also\nbeen reported that they have had a greater impact on non-violent than on violent crime, and\nthat a disproportionate number of offenders sentenced under these provisions are black.\nA number of European countries, with legal systems based on civil law rather than common\nlaw, impose minimum sentences for certain offences, but do not have prison populations as\nlarge as that of the United States, or indeed that of the United Kingdom. \nAs far as this country is concerned, successive governments have upheld the view that the\nsentence imposed in an individual case should be determined by the judge from the range of\npenalties available. The only general offence for which a mandatory sentence of imprisonment\nis currently specified is murder, for which the mandatory penalty is life imprisonment. The\nGovernment's view of minimum sentences for certain drugs offences was set out in a Written\nAnswer on November 3rd 1994 by the then junior minister at the Home Office, Michael\nForsyth, as follows:1\nMr. Gallie: To ask the Secretary of State for the\nHome Department what plans he has to set minimum jail\nsentences for those who sell category A drugs; and if he\nwill make a statement.\nMr. Michael Forsyth: None. The courts should be\nleft to determine appropriate sentences in individual cases.\nThe maximum penalty for supplying category A drugs is\nlife imprisonment. We look to the courts to pass very\nlong prison sentences in the most serious cases.\nThe formal channels of influence over sentencing decisions such as the Judicial Studies\nBoard, which organises training seminars for judges, and the Court of Appeal, have in recent\nyears been attempting to encourage greater consistency in sentencing. It is, after all,\ninconsistencies in sentencing which have often contributed to public dissatisfaction with the\noperation of the criminal law in this area. The Court of Appeal has issued decisions from\ntime to time which are specifically referred to a \"guidelines\" for future use. (The guidelines\non sentencing for rape in R v Billam (1986) 1 WLR 349 resulted in marked increases in\nsentencing levels for rape). However, even these \"guidelines\" do not deprive the judge of his\ndiscretion over the sentence which is ultimately imposed. The Court of Appeal has always\nbeen wary of giving the impression that its decisions are to be regarded as absolutely\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 HC Deb Vol 248 c1334 (W) 3.11.1994\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nauthoritative and has often stressed that each case depends on its own facts.\nLay magistrates receive guidance about sentencing and other matters from the justices' clerks\nwho serve their courts. The Magistrate's Association has produced Sentencing Guidelines for\nthose criminal offences which frequently come before magistrates' courts. The introductory\nchapter points out, however, that the guidelines are only starting points for discussion of\nindividual sentences, not finishing points and that\n\"The responsibility for the sentence is that of the justices and it is they who must assess\neach case judicially having regard to\n a) the circumstances of the particular offence and\n b) the circumstances of the particular offender.\"\nSections 35 and 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 enable the Attorney-General in certain\ncircumstances to refer to the Court of Appeal, with the leave of that Court, a case in which\nit appears to him that the sentencing of a person by the Crown Court has been unduly lenient.\nThe Court of Appeal may then quash the original sentence and substitute another, which may\nbe more severe than the original, but must be within the range of sentencing options which\nwould have been available to the original court. The cases which may be referred to the\nCourt of Appeal are those involving\na) offences triable only on indictment (that is, triable only by a judge and jury at the\nCrown Court.)\nb) offences of indecent assault on a woman or a man, threats to kill, cruelty to persons\nunder 16, or attempts or incitements to commit any of these offences,\nc) cases of fraud which have been tried on indictment following a transfer to the Crown\nCourt under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, or following the preferment\nof a voluntary bill of indictment after the dismissal of a charge under Section 6 of the\n1987 Act.\nIn the majority of cases it has dealt with under this procedure the Court of Appeal has\nincreased the sentence handed down by the Crown Court.

The Sentencing Framework\nThe Criminal Justice Act 1991 set out a framework for sentencing practice which incorporated\na number of significant changes in the approach to be taken by the courts in sentencing\noffenders. The seriousness of the offence is the main focus of the decision-making process\nunder the sentencing provisions set out in the Act. The 1991 legislation was also intended to\nlead to the greater use of community-based sentences, which would restrict the liberty of the\noffender without the need to resort to a custodial sentence. Section 1 of the 1991 Act, as\namended by the Criminal Justice Act 1993, provides that where a person is convicted of an\noffence punishable with a custodial sentence other than one fixed by law (such as the penalty\nfor murder) the court may not pass a custodial sentence on an offender unless it is of the\nopinion:\na) that the offence, or the combination of the offence and one other offence associated\nwith it, was so serious that only such a sentence can be justified for the offence; or\nb) where the offence is a violent or sexual offence, that only such a sentence would be\nadequate to protect the public from serious harm from him.\nSection 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which was also amended by the Criminal Justice\nAct 1993, set out the criteria to be used by the courts in determining the length of custodial\nsentences imposed for offences other than those, such as murder, for which the sentence is\nfixed by law. The criteria are as follows:\n(2) The custodial sentence shall be-\n(a) for such term (not exceeding the permitted maximum) as in the\nopinion of the court is commensurate with the seriousness of the\noffence, or the combination of the offence and one or more offences\nassociated with it; or\n(b) where the offence is a violent or sexual offence, for such longer term\n(not exceeding that maximum) as in the opinion of the court is\nnecessary to protect the public from serious harm from the offender.\n\"Sexual offence\" and \"violent offence\" are defined by Section 31(1) of the 1991 Act, as\namended by Section 168 and Schedule 9 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.\nThe definition of \"sexual offence\" is limited to certain specified offences, including rape and\nother offences under the Sexual Offences Act 1956, but is not restricted to sexual offences\nagainst children and young persons. It is set out as follows:\n\"sexual offence' means any of the following-\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\n(a) an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 1956, other than an offence\nunder section 30, 31 or 33 to 36 of that Act;\n(b) an offence under section 128 of the Mental Health Act 1959;\n(c) an offence under the Indecency with Children Act 1960;\n(d) an offence under section 9 of the Theft Act 1968 of burglary with\nintent to commit rape;\n(e) an offence under section 54 of the Criminal Law Act 1977;\n(f) an offence under the Protection of Children Act 1978;\n(g) an offence under section I of the Criminal Law Act 1977 of conspiracy\nto commit any of the offences in paragraphs (a) to (f) above;\n(h) an offence under section 1 of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 of\nattempting to commit any of those offences;\n(i) an offence of inciting another to commit any of those offences;\nThe offences created by these earlier Acts are described on p.49-50.\nThe definition of \"violent offence\" is more general, referring to any offence \"which leads, or\nis intended or is likely to lead to a person's death or to physical injury to a person, and\nincludes an offence which is required to be charged as arson (whether or not it would\notherwise fall within this definition)\". \n     \nThe power to impose a sentence longer than is commensurate with the seriousness of the\noffence replaced a power under Sections 28 and 29 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act\n1973 to impose extended sentences of imprisonment on persistent offenders, which was\nabolished by Section 5(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991.\n  \nIn his book Acts of Abuse: Sex Offenders and the Criminal Justice System,3 Adam Sampson\nsuggests that the use by the courts of their power under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 to\nimpose longer sentences on people convicted of sexual offences could result in an adverse\njudgment by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) because, while sentences of\npreventive detention are not illegal as such under the terms of the European Convention on\nHuman Rights, the ECHR has previously held that recidivist offenders who are given such\nsentences are entitled to periodic reviews by a \"court\" to determine whether or not they are\nstill dangerous. The right to periodic review of a person's detention is set out in Article 5 (4)\nof the European Convention, which provides that:\n\"Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take\nproceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court\nand his release ordered if the detention is not lawful\"\nThomas's Current Sentencing Practice contains a summary of the statutory provisions and\njudgments of the Court of Appeal on the sentencing of violent and sexual offenders.

Section 4 of the 1991 Act imposes additional requirements in the\ncase of mentally disordered offenders. \nThe imposition on an offender convicted of a violent or sexual offence of \"such longer\nterm.....as in the opinion of the court is necessary to protect the public\" is a mandatory\nrequirement under Section 2(2)(b) of the 1991 Act. It may extend to the imposition of a\ncustodial sentence for an indeterminate period, such as a discretionary life sentence, provided\nthat this is also the maximum penalty provided for the offence in question.6 A number of\nserious violent and sexual offences, such as attempted murder, manslaughter, wounding with\nintent to do grievous bodily harm, robbery, rape and attempted rape, have a maximum penalty\nof life imprisonment, as do the offences of aggravated burglary and arson.\nThomas's Current Sentencing Practice contains the following summary of the judgments of\nthe Court of Appeal concerning the circumstances in which a discretionary life sentence may\nbe appropriate, with particular reference to mentally disordered offenders:7\nA sentence of life imprisonment should not be imposed unless the offender\nis subject to a mental condition or personality defect which makes it\nprobable that he will commit grave offences in the future if he is not subject\nto confinement for an indefinite period\nIt is the normal practice for a judge to consider medical evidence before\nimposing a life sentence, but he may do so without such evidence in\nexceptional circumstances\nA sentence of life imprisonment may be imposed on an offender who is not\nsuffering from a mental disorder or other condition defined by the Mental\nHealth Act 1983, s.l, provided that there is evidence that he is likely to\ncommit grave offences in the future\nA sentence of life imprisonment may be imposed on an offender if there is\nevidence that he is likely to commit grave crimes in the future, even though\nhis condition is unlikely to improve with treatment\nA sentence of life imprisonment may be imposed on an offender who has\nbeen convicted of offences which would not justify determinate sentences\nof comparable effective length, if the evidence of a propensity to commit\ngrave offences in the future is particularly strong\nWhere a sentence of life imprisonment has been properly imposed for the\nprotection of the public, it is not necessarily open to objection on the ground\nthat the indeterminate nature of the sentence is itself hindering the treatment\nof the offender, where the prospects of successful treatment are in any event\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n6 Criminal Justice Act 1991 Section 2(4)\n7 Quick Contents Guide p.528-529 \n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\ntenuous\nA sentence of life imprisonment should not be imposed in a case where a\ndeterminate sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offence will provide\na sufficient measure of protection for the public\nWhere an offender is sentenced to life imprisonment on conviction for\nmurder, he should not be sentenced to life imprisonment for any other\noffence for which he is sentenced on the same occasion, unless he satisfies\nthe usual criteria for a discretionary life sentence\nWhere an offender is sentenced to life imprisonment for the protection of the\npublic and for his own benefit, it is not correct practice to impose\ndisproportionately long fixed term sentences on other counts so as to restrict\nthe power of the Secretary of State to release the offender\nIf a judge has a sentence of life imprisonment in mind, he should tell\ncounsel and give him a chance to deal with the matter specifically before\nimposing the sentence\nWhere an offender is suffering from a mental disorder which is susceptible\nto treatment and a place is available in a special hospital, the court should\nnot impose a sentence of life imprisonment with the intention of preventing\nthe release of the offender by the Mental Health Review Tribunal\nWhen an offender who has been released on licence from a sentence Of life\nimprisonment is convicted of a further offence of violence, a further\nsentence of life imprisonment should not be imposed unless the usual criteria\nfor the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment are satisfied\nThe fact that an offender is already subject to a sentence of life\nimprisonment imposed on an earlier occasion does not mean that a further\nsentence of life imprisonment is necessarily wrong in principle, if the criteria\nfor the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment are satisfied in relation\nto the latest offence\nC. The Use of Imprisonment\nThe use of imprisonment\nIn 1995 in England and Wales, 79,200 offenders were sentenced to immediate custody8 by\nthe courts. Of these, 59,900 had been sentenced for indictable offences, 6,000 for summary\nnon-motoring offences and 13,200 for summary motoring offences. Of those sentenced for\nindictable offences, 20,200 were sentenced in magistrates' courts and 39,700 in the crown\ncourts. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8\n Unsuspended imprisonment, detention in a young offender institution or partly suspended sentence (abolished in\nSeptember 1992).\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nLooking first at sentencing for indictable offences in magistrates' courts, immediate custody\nrepresented only 8.8% of all sentences (20,200 cases in all). The most popular sentence in\nmagistrates courts was the fine, accounting for 37.4% of all sentences, followed by absolute\nor conditional discharges (23.4%). The numbers sentenced to immediate custody have risen\nin recent years after falls in the 1980s: in 1990 only 11,300 - 4.4% of all those sentenced for\nindictable offences in magistrates' courts - were given immediate custody whereas in 1985,\nfor example, the number was 30,800 (8.7% of the total).\nIn the crown courts, immediate custody was the most common sentence imposed for\nindictable offences. In 1995, 39,700 offenders (55.7% of all those sentenced) were given\ncustodial sentences. The proportion sentenced to immediate custody has risen substantially\nin recent years: in 1990 the figure was 43.0% (36,800 offenders). In 1985 it was 53.1%\n(47,400 offenders). \nOverall, the number of offenders given immediate custody for all offences (indictable and\nsummary) at all courts was 79,200 in 1995, the highest figure since 1985. The proportionate\nuse of immediate custody for indictable offences at all courts was the highest figure for 16\nyears, at 19.9%9.\nD. The Objects of Sentencing and the Effectiveness of Penal Sanctions\nIn a 1975 case10 Lord Justice Lawton set out what he called \"the classical principles of\nsentencing\" in very clear terms:\nWhat ought the proper penalty to be? We have thought it necessary not\nonly to analyse the facts, but to apply to those facts the classical principles\nof sentencing. Those classical principles are summed up in four words:\nretribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation. Any judge who comes\nto sentence ought always to have those four classical principles in mind and\nto apply them to the facts of the case to see which of them has the greatest\nimportance in the case with which he is dealing.\nI will start with retribution. The Old Testament concept of an eye for an\neye and tooth for tooth no longer plays any part in our criminal law. There\nis, however, another aspect of retribution which is frequently overlooked: it\nis that society, through the courts, must show its abhorrence of particular\ntypes of crime, and the only way in which the courts can show this is by the\nsentences they pass. The courts do not have to reflect public opinion. On\nthe other hand courts must not disregard it. Perhaps the main duty of the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n9\n 1995 figures provisional.

Anyone who surveys the criminal scene at\nthe present time must be alive to the appalling problem of violence.\nSociety, we are satisfied, expects the courts to deal with violence. The\nweapons which the courts have at their disposal for doing so are few. We\nare satisfied that in most cases fines are not sufficient punishment for\nsenseless violence. The time has come, in the opinion of this Court, when\nthose who indulge in the kind of violence with which we are concerned in\nthis case must expect custodial sentences.\nBut we are also satisfied that, although society expects the courts to\nimpose punishment for violence which really hurts, it does not expect the\ncourts to go on hurting for a long time, which is what this sentence is likely\nto do. We agree with the trial judge that the kind of violence which occurred\nin this case called for a custodial sentence. This young man has had a\ncustodial sentence. Despite his good character, despite the excellent\nbackground from which he comes, very deservedly he has bad the\nhumiliation of hearing prison gates closing behind him. We take the view\nthat for men of good character the very fact that prison gates have closed is\nthe main punishment. It does not necessarily follow that they should remain\nclosed for a long time.\nI turn now to the element of deterrence, because it seems to us the trial\njudge probably passed this sentence as a deterrent one. There are two\naspects of deterrence: deterrence of the offender and deterrence of likely\noffenders. Experience has shown over the years that deterrence of the\noffender is not a very useful approach, because those who have their wits\nabout them usually find the closing of prison gates an experience which they\ndo not want again. If they do not learn that lesson, there is likely to be a\nhigh degree of recidivism anyway. So far as deterrence of others is\nconcerned, it is the experience of the courts that deterrent sentences are of\nlittle value in respect of offences which are committed on the spur of the\nmoment, either in hot blood or in drink or both. Deterrent sentences may\nvery well be of considerable value where crime is premeditated. Burglars,\nrobbers and users of firearms and weapons may very well be put off by\ndeterrent sentences. We think it unlikely that deterrence would be of any\nvalue in this case.\nWe come now to the element of prevention. Unfortunately it is one of\nthe facts of life that there are some offenders for whom neither deterrence\nnor rehabilitation works. They will go on committing crimes as long as they\nare able to do so. In those cases the only protection which the public has\nis that such persons should be locked up for a long period. This case does\nnot call for a preventive sentence.\nFinally, there is the principle of rehabilitation. Some 20 to 25 years ago\nthere was a view abroad, held by many people in executive authority, that\nshort sentences were of little value, because there was not enough time to\ngive in prison the benefit of training. That view is no longer held as firmly\nas it was. This young man does not want prison training. It is not going\nto do him any good. It is his memory of the clanging of prison gates which\nis likely to keep him from crime in the future.\nThe Sentence of the Court - A Handbook for Magistrates published in 1995, expands on the\nfour elements described in this case by setting out what it describes as the six traditionally\nrecognised objects of sentencing:\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\ni) punishment;\nii) reparation (including financial compensation to a victim);\niii) protection of the public;\niv) deterrence;\nv) reflecting proper public concern;\nvi) rehabilitation.\nThe rehabilitative ideal in sentencing was somewhat undermined by a view, initially put\nforward in the 1970's11 that no penal treatment was effective in rehabilitating offenders and\nthereby reducing recidivism. The information and data on which this \"nothing works\"\nargument was based was criticised by some commentators and researchers while others have\nsought to rebut the argument on more general grounds. A review of the literature on the\neffectiveness of sentencing published by the Home Office Research and Planning Unit in 1976\ndrew the following conclusions from the results of research on the effectiveness of different\nsentences in fulfilling rehabilitative aims by reducing recidivism :12\nReviewers of research into the effectiveness of different sentences or ways\nof treating or training offenders have. unanimously agreed that the results\nhave so far offered little hope that a reliable and simple remedy for\nrecidivism can be easily found. They have pointed out that studies which\nhave produced positive results have been isolated, inconsistent in their\nevidence, and open to so much methodological criticism that they must\nremain unconvincing. The main criticisms, which are substantial ones,\ncentre around questions as to the comparability of the samples (that is,\nwhether influences other than the treatment are accounting for differences\nin outcome) and inconsistencies in standards of failure. It has seemed,\ntherefore, that longer sentences are no more elective than short ones, that\ndifferent types of institutions work about equally as well, that probationers\non the whole do no better than if they were sent to prison, and that\nrehabilitative programmes - whether involving psychiatric treatment,\ncounselling, casework or intensive contact and special attention, in custodial\nor non-custodial settings have no predictably beneficial effects. The\ncomparative advantages of other types of sentences remain, unfortunately,\nlargely untested. Martinson's conclusions, based upon a great number of\ninvestigations into a wide range of treatment and training, were so\npessimistic that publication of his review was delayed for three years.\nThis apparent failure of research to demonstrate the corrective value of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n11 by R.

It has seen the rejection of reconviction as the sole criterion\nof success, and a growing concern for evaluation according to other\nstandards. A noticeable trend has been a readiness to justify non-custodial\nor semi-custodial sentences in preference to imprisonment or incarceration,\non the grounds that they cost very much less to implement,' and decrease at\nthe same time the risk of psychological and practical harm to the offender.\nAs 'softer' sentences have apparently no worse effect on recidivism and still\noffer the chance of less tangible if as yet unknown advantages, they are seen\nas preferable by all schools of thought except perhaps the retributivist.\nBut is a pessimistic outlook entirely substantiated by the results of research?\nTo the researcher, the subject is by no means closed. Just as methodological\ndeficiencies and flaws in carrying out experiments make any results dubious,\nso they make unacceptable any assurances that corrective changes cannot be\ninduced. Since the beginning of the present decade, and therefore not\nincluded in previous reviews, research has been continuing, and if it has not\nfound any more positive results, at least there has been progress in\nunderstanding of the complexities to be faced. The climate of opinion in\nAmerica seems lately to have become a little more optimistic. Adams, for\nexample, writing in 1974, suggested that correctional research \"is doing as\nwell as can be expected under the circumstances\" and compared the\nproductiveness of evaluation in correctional research favourably with that in\nindustry or medicine. He has recently prepared a 'guide' (Adams 1975), in\nwhich he critically evaluates correctional research and indicates how it might\nbe put to better use in the future. What has emerged more clearly is a\nrecognition that simple comparisons between different sentences, no matter\nhow carefully carried out, cannot be expected easily to find differences in\neffect.\nThe review summarised research on different types of custodial and non-custodial treatment,\nincluding different institutional programmes. It described the results of research on time spent\nin custody and on the effectiveness of custodial versus non-custodial sentences and set out\nsome criticisms of research as follows:13 \nTime in custody\nOf nine studies, five found that length of time served appeared not to affect\nreconviction, two that longer periods in prison had no adverse effects, and\nthe others that different types of offenders were affected in different ways.\nThe various samples studied were far from homogeneous, covering offenders\nof all ages and of all degrees of custodial experience. Nor is it simply\nlength of prison sentence that has been investigated. Mueller and Jaman\nwere really looking at the effects of acceptance or rejection for parole, and\nWeeks was more concerned with the overall regimes than merely with time\nspent in the different institutions. The Florida study dealt with unique\ncircumstances. Where differences were demonstrated, they cannot be\naccepted as generally applicable in view of the doubts about the\ncomparability of the samples and the particular circumstances of the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n13 ibid. p39-41\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nexperiments. It can be concluded that there is no evidence that longer\ncustodial sentences produce better results than shorter sentences.\nCustodial or non-custodial sentences\nThe results are somewhat conflicting, and seemingly dependent on the\ncriminal experience of the offenders. The danger that the better risks are\nselected for probation makes any findings favouring non-custodial sentences\nrather suspect, even when every care is taken to control extraneous\ninfluences. The Provo results, which provided the clearest evidence for the\nsuperiority of probationary sentences, were regarded sceptically by the\nauthors because they believed that unforeseen circumstances early in the\nexperiment meant that the samples were not properly matched to start with.\nIf this is true, the same doubts apply equally, or more so, to other less\ncarefully-planned investigations. The other major study the Community\nTreatment Project, which also found that juvenile offenders under intensive\ncommunity supervision did better than similar youths who went to an\ninstitution, has been strongly criticised on the grounds that the difference in\noutcome merely reflects a more lenient attitude on the part of the authorities\nto subsequent misdemeanours committed by the experimental subjects.\nIn Britain, straightforward comparisons have been made between offenders\nsentenced to an institution or released under probationary supervision. In\nAmerica, things are not so simple: most of the control subjects are released\nquite early in their sentences and spend the rest of the period on parole,\nwhich in practice closely resembles probation. So, in a way, American\nstudies have been more concerned with variations in the quality or intensity\nof community supervision.\nThe major implication of research findings in this aspect of sentencing is\nagain that different types of offenders respond in different ways to the\nvarious treatments applied to them. The deterrent value of other non-\ncustodial sentences, like fines or suspended sentences, warrants further study.\nSOME CRITICISMS OF RESEARCH\nAlthough, as has been seen, it is not too difficult to criticise most of the\nempirical evidence suggesting that certain types of sentences or treatments\nare more effective than others, it cannot necessarily be said that the\ndifferences in outcome which have been found are not real ones. The same\ncan be said, perhaps with greater force, about those studies-the majority-\nwhich failed to show that different ways of disposing of convicted offenders\nmade any difference to their chances of offending again. Some of the\nmethodological issues which have been raised in criticism of studies\npurporting to show differential outcomes particularly issues concerned with\ncomparability of samples and measures of success and failure@an also be\nused to explain (though never completely) why other research has failed to\nshow any differences. There are two other considerations which appear to\nbe the most crucial in this respect, the first dealing with questions about\ntreatment assumptions, and the second referring to the demonstration of so-\ncalled interaction effects, the matching of appropriate treatment to different\ntypes of offenders.\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nThe 1976 Home Office review explained references to the deterrent value of sentences as\nfollows:14\nAs for the deterrent value of sentences, there are two purposes. The first is\nto deter an individual offender from further delinquency and can be observed\non occasions when a severe sentence is deliberately awarded instead of a\nmore lenient but equally applicable one, to 'teach a lesson'. The other is by\nmaking sure that justice is seen to be done, to make it clear by example that\ncrime does not pay. It is assumed that the fear of incurring the stigma of\na court appearance, the discomfort of prison or the inconvenience of\nfinancial loss will ensure self-control in most people whose consciences\nmight otherwise lapse. This is known as general deterrence.\nMuch research has been undertaken into the individual deterrent effect of sentences. The\nconclusion has invariably been reached that it is hard to show any effect that one type of\nsentence is more likely to have than any other in reducing the rate of re-offending, which\ntends to be high for all types. Longer custodial sentences have not generally been found to\nproduce better results than shorter ones as far as individual deterrence is concerned. The\ngeneral deterrent effect is very hard to measure. It tends to be seen as operating only for\npremeditated criminal acts committed by people making rational calculations as to the\nlikelihood of their being apprehended, the sentence they will be given (which may depend on\nthe charges which are brought against them) and the profits they will make from their crime.\nThe general consensus emanating from the research in this area has been that it is the\nprobability of arrest and conviction that is likely to deter would-be offenders, rather than the\npossibility of severe penalties being meted out to them.\nA Home Office Research Study entitled Taking Offenders out of Circulation, published in\n1980, noted that:15\nThe studies reported here have shown that it is no easier to measure the\ncrime preventive effect of imprisonment in absolute terms than it is to judge\nthe deterrent or rehabilitative value of any sentencing decision. However,\nwith regard to imprisonment at least, it is possible to say what would be the\nconsequences in numerical terms of adopting various sentencing policies,\nand for practical purposes, this sort of information is useful enough.\nThere is now almost unanimous agreement that less rather than more use\nshould be made of prisons. One of the main purposes of this report was to\ntry to assess whether by sending fewer people to prison, or by keeping them\nthere for shorter periods, their opportunities to commit crime would be\nsubstantially greater. Making use of what data were available, it seems safe\nto say that the effect on the recorded crime rate would be negligible. It was\nestimated that were remission increased from one third to one half for adult\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 ibid. p.2\n15 Home Office Research Study 64 1980 p35-37\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nmale prisoners (excluding lifers), convictions would increase by only 1.2 per\ncent per year, while if the time served by each offender was reduced by four\nmonths (or his actual sentence reduced by six months), convictions would\nincrease by 1.6 per cent. Either policy would substantially reduce the prison\npopulation: increased remission would have reduced the total time offenders\nspent in prison by 25 per cent; six months off every sentence by 40 per cent.\nIn practice, other policies to reduce the length of time offenders spend in\ncustody might be preferred, such as increased use of parole. But the general\npoint remains from the evidence that a small amount of increased crime has\nto be balanced against the real economic and social savings that could be\nmade by quite modest changes in the current use of imprisonment.\nThis relative imbalance in saying and costs derives, of course, from the fact\nthat most offenders are not sent to prison, so that those who are contribute\nonly very minimally to overall crime rates. This means that even though\nchanges in policy would probably be without much harmful effect, it cannot\nbe said that imprisonment as such is without preventive effect. Analysing\nthe data in another way, it becomes apparent that imprisonment does to\nsome significant extent curtail the criminal activities of those who are locked\nup. The number of people appearing before the courts, from whom the\npresent samples were drawn, would have been reduced by about 17 to 25\nper cent had each of them, for his immediately prior offence, been sentenced\nto 18 months in custody. One might assume from this rather stark statistic\nthat were ostensibly much harsher sentencing policies adopted, there would\nbe a noticeable reduction in crime. It is,of course, difficult to be very\nprecise about its extent, because,it is impossible to assess the effects of other\ncircumstances which would prevail under such a gross system. For instance,\nif certainty of imprisonment was matched by certainty of detection, it is very\nlikely that more people would think twice about committing an offence, and\nso there would be fewer offenders to be dealt with, anyway. On the other\nhand, one cannot be sure whether incarceration really prevents crime or just\ndelays its inevitable commission until the offender is released. The courts\nwould have to contend, too, with the very natural grievances which\nmandatory sentences would certainly promote, and which might impel many\nwho felt themselves unjustly treated to continue in a life of crime. However,\nif in an attempt to preserve some scale of fair punishment, more serious\noffenders were given even longer sentences, the preventive effect might be\nconsiderably enhanced.\nThere is no need to do more than to speculate about these possibilities,\nbecause in practice a sentencing policy which relied on imprisonment to an\nextent which noticeably lowered the incidence of crime by keeping known\noffenders out of the way would be unthinkable for other reasons, not the\nleast of which is the intolerable burden it would place on the prison system.\nMandatory 18 month prison sentences for all offences, for example, would\nprobably increase the time spent by offenders in prison by something like\nfour to seven times the present length. To put it briefly, there is no practical\nway in which the potentially preventive function of prisons can be\nsignificantly exploited as a general principle.\nThere is a certain amount of evidence, however, to suggest that prisons\ncould be used more efficiently, by taking maximum advantage of their\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\npreventive usefulness while ensuring that their resources are not wasted.\nThis could be done by the more careful selection of the people who are sent\nthere. While the failure rate of ex-prisoners is certainly very high, it is true\nalso that substantial numbers never return. Home Office statistics show that\nof all males discharged from custodial institutions, almost half are not re-\nconvicted within two years (the crucial period); and almost a third of the\nprisoners in the samples used in the present analysis had not been in trouble\nagain after five or six years. Obviously no preventive gains are achieved by\nimprisoning these people. Even if their 'success' indicates that they were\ngenuinely deterred by the experience which seems unlikely, in most cases,\nfrom what we know from research into deterrents - the same result could\nalmost certainly be obtained by shorter periods in custody. Those who are\nnot re-convicted are distinguished above all by the brevity of their criminal\nrecords, and other things being equal, the utmost discretion should be\nexercised when imprisonment is being considered for people like these.\nSometimes, of course, other things are not equal. A short record is not\nalways a trivial one, and this raises the question of the serious or dangerous\noffender, for whom the possibility of causing serious harm is a more urgent\nconsideration than the statistical likelihood of his doing so. The importance\nof prisons as places for the confinement of persons who represent grave\nrisks to public safety has recently been given much prominence. The second\npart of the report concludes, however, that undue emphasis on this aspect of\nprevention is probably misguided, in that while quite a lot of people may\noccasionally behave recklessly or violently, the idea of the 'dangerous\noffender' as a criminal type is something of an illusion. In the first place,\nthere exist neither any satisfactory legal definitions, nor any scientific\nmeasures, by which he can be reliably identified. In practice, assessments\nof dangerousness are no more than subjective expectations about the\nlikelihood of any offender causing serious personal injury in the future. As\nthese expectations naturally rely very heavily on knowledge of past\nbehaviour, it is obviously an advantage to have the fullest possible accounts\nof offenders' histories and circumstances before coming to any decisions\nabout them, but even so, no-one has been able to predict accurately more\nthan half the time, and seldom as often as that. Most 'expert' predictions\nseem to be right for only one out of three individuals. The number of\ncriminals who are recognised immediately as a 'public danger' and are\npromptly put away for an indefinite term is very small indeed, and their\nprolonged incarceration means that it is never possible to test the accuracy\nof the judgements made about them. But the 52 'dangerous' prisoners in the\nsample described in this report who had been judged, from detailed reports\nabout them, to be capable of wantonly causing death or serious bodily harm\nfulfilled this prophecy so infrequently that even if all of them had been\nconfined for an extra five years, only nine really serious assaults would have\nbeen prevented. And within the same period, an equal number of serious\nattacks were perpetrated by ex-prisoners who had previously shown no\nindications at all of dangerous tendencies, and for whom there could have\nbeen no justification for prolonged detention.\nThe infrequency of really serious crimes of violence, their apparently\ngenerally random quality and the rarity of anything like a genuinely\n'dangerous type' offers little encouragement for a policy which aims to\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nreduce serious assaults by selective incapacitation of those with violent\nrecords. Violence is not necessarily repetitive, and even when it is, it is not\nusually so extreme that its prevention would justify locking people up\nindefinitely. The public is already as well protected as it can expect from\nserious danger. The results, of course, do not discourage a proper lack of\ncaution or suggest that personal experience or judicial intuition are not\nimportant. Indeed, there is every indication that these qualities will remain\nthe best alternative to an enormously increased, very costly and largely\nunprofitable use of detention.\nAs this extract suggests, there was a growing consensus during the 1980s and early 1990s\nabout the need to reduce the use of imprisonment and restrict it to those categories of\noffender from whom the public needs to be protected. A number of factors, such as the very\nhigh cost of keeping offenders in prison, doubts about the effectiveness of imprisonment as\na means of lowering the crime rate and the fact that a considerable proportion of crimes are\ncommitted by young offenders, for whom custodial sentences are considered to involve an\nincreased risk that they will go on to lead lives of crime, resulted in increased interest in\nfinding effective alternatives to imprisonment and in the wider question of social crime\nprevention, including initiatives aimed at diverting young people from criminal careers\nthrough early intervention.\nThe Green Paper Punishment, Custody and the Community16, published in 1988 and the 1990\nWhite Paper Crime, Justice and Protecting the Public17 which set out proposals for the\nsentencing framework duly implemented in the Criminal Justice Act 1991, reflected this\nconsensus. The White Paper stated that18:\n2.6 Reforming offenders is always best if it can be achieved. It is better\nthat people should exercise self-control than have controls imposed upon\nthem. This needs self discipline and motivation. Many offenders have little\nunderstanding of the effect of their actions on others. Compensation and\ncommunity service can bring home to offenders the effect of their behaviour\non other people. The probation service tries to make offenders face up to\nwhat they have done, to give them a greater sense of responsibility and to\nhelp them resist pressure from others to take part in crime. Voluntary\norganisations have a long tradition of helping offenders to turn away from\ncrime.\n2.7 It was once believed that prison, properly used, could encourage a high\nproportion of offenders to start an honest life on their release. Nobody now\nregards imprisonment, in itself, as an effective means of reform for most\nprisoners. If there is continued progress against overcrowding in prisons, the\nrecent reforms should enable better regimes to be developed, with more\nopportunities for education, and work, and so a greater chance of turning the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n16 Cm 424\n17 Cm 965\n18 See above p\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nlives of some inmates in a positive direction. But however much prison\nstaff try to inject a positive purpose into the regime , as they do, prison is\na society which requires virtually no sense of personal responsibility from\nprisoners. Normal social or working habits do not fit. The opportunity to\nlearn from other criminals is pervasive. For most offenders, imprisonment\nhas to be justified in terms of public protection, denunciation and retribution.\nOtherwise it can be an expensive way of making bad people worse. The\nprospects of reforming offenders are usually much better if they stay in the\ncommunity, provided the public is properly protected.\n2.8 Deterrence is a principle with much immediate appeal. Most law\nabiding citizens understand the reasons why some behaviour is made a\ncriminal offence, and would be deterred by the shame of a criminal\nconviction or the possibility of a severe penalty. There are doubtless some\ncriminals who carefully calculate the possible gains and risks. But much\ncrime is committed on impulse, given the opportunity presented by an open\nwindow or unlocked door, and it is committed by offenders who live from\nmoment to moment; their crimes are as impulsive as the rest of their\nfeckless, sad or pathetic lives. It is unrealistic to construct sentencing\narrangements on the assumption that most offenders will weigh up the\npossibilities in advance and base their conduct on rational calculation. Often\nthey do not.\n2.9 The Government's proposals therefore emphasise the objectives which\nsentencing is most likely to meet successfully in whole or in part. The first\nobjective for all sentences is denunciation of and retribution for the crime.\nDepending on the offence and the offender, the sentence may also aim to\nachieve public protection, reparation and reform of the offender, preferably\nin the community. This approach points to sentencing policies which are\nmore firmly based on the seriousness of the offence, and just desserts for the\noffender.\nIn a report on \"Recidivism and Imprisonment\" published in a 1994 Home Office Research\nBulletin Ros Burnett, from the Centre for Criminological Research at Oxford University,\nnoted that the results of interviews conducted with a group of recidivist offenders who had\nbeen convicted of offences concerning property and were nearing release from prison\nsuggested that a wish to avoid further imprisonment was critical in decisions not to reoffend.\nThe report also noted that while the fact that non-custodial penalties had had very little impact\non this particular group of recidivist offenders, the same could not be assumed to be true of\nother property offenders who had not experienced custody.19 In a study for the Home Office\non \"The Dynamics of Recidivism\", which has not been published but was referred to by the\nHome Secretary, Michael Howard, during a debate on his sentencing proposals on June 19th\n1996, Ros Burnett apparently found on the basis of interviews with prisoners that \"Avoidance\nof imprisonment was the most frequently mentioned reason for not wanting to re-offend\"20\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n19\n\"Recidivism and imprisonment\" - Ros Burnett Home Office Research Bulletin No.36\n20 HC Deb Vol 279 c892 19.6.1996\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nThe White Paper Protecting the Public published in March 1996, setting out the proposals\nwhich the Crime (Sentences) Bill is designed to implement, states that:21\n1.12. The Government firmly believes that prison works. First, by taking\noffenders out of circulation it prevents them from committing yet more\ncrime. The majority of crimes are committed by a relatively small number\nof criminals. Research has suggested that between three and 13 offences\ncould be prevented for each convicted domestic burglar imprisoned for a\nyear.\nSecond, prison protects the public from dangerous criminals.\nThird, prison-and the threat of prison-acts as a deterrent to would-be\ncriminals.\nFinally, time spent in prison can be used to rehabilitate offenders, for\nexample by improving their training or education. The most recent\nreconviction rates show that criminals sent to prison are no more likely to\nreoffend than those given community sentences - a recent survey based on\na sample of 1992 cases showed reconviction rates within 2 years of 51% for\nthose released from prison, 55% for those who received a community\nsentence and 58% for those who received a probation order.\nThis extract suggests that it is the Government's view that \"prison works\", not in the sense\nthat it might make convicted prisoners less likely to re-offend than those given other penalties\nsuch as community sentences, but that it \"works\" in the sense that it satisfies the objects of\npublic protection and crime prevention through the incapacitation of offenders, at least as far\nas offences committed outside prisons are concerned.\nE. Public Attitudes to Sentencing\nCommentators often refer to the widely-held belief that the courts are much more lenient in\nsentencing offenders than the general public would like. Polls and surveys generally suggest\nthat there is public demand for \"tougher\" punishment. A number of research studies in this\ncountry and abroad have, however, suggested that the image of a straightforwardly harsh\npublic needs some qualification. In a paper published in the November 1996 issue of the\nCriminal Law Review Andrew Ashworth from the School of Law at King's College, London\nand Michael Hough, Professor of Social Policy at South Bank University make the following\nobservations about public attitudes to sentencing:22\nOn the face of it, there is plenty of evidence to point to widespread\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n21 Cm 3190 p3-4\n22 [1996] Crim LR 780\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\npublic dissatisfaction with sentencing. In general, polls and surveys reveal\na punitive public. Support for capital punishment has run at between 65 per\ncent and 75 per cent, depending on the precise wording of the question, for\nmany years; and a poll carried out for the Daily Mail found 92 per cent of\na random sample supporting \"tougher sentences for criminals, especially\npersistent criminals\". However, several research studies carried out mainly\nin the 1980s suggest that there is a need to qualify the picture of a public\nwhich is straightforwardly punitive. Responses to questions pitched at a very\ngeneral level, such as \"Are court sentences tough enough?\" certainly did\nshow a clear majority favouring tougher sentences; but when asked about\nsuitable punishments for individual cases of specific types of crime, people's\npreferences tended to reflect the range of sentences actually imposed by\nsentences. Although this research was limited, it was fairly consistent with\nwork carried out in several other industrialised countries, notably Australia,\nCanada, the Netherlands and the United States.\nThe authors go on to suggest that the most obvious explanation for those divergent findings\nlies in the lack of information which people have about crime and about sentencing practice.\nThey point to studies which, show that people systematically understand how much the courts\nactually use imprisonment.\nThey note that the few studies which have asked victims how they would like to see \"their\"\noffender punished have failed to find evidence of widespread vindictiveness and that on\nbalance, victims' views have tended to be consistent with those of the general public. In\nrecommending that the publication of better and more meaningful information about\nsentencing be made a priority the authors state that:23\nTo construct sentencing policy on this flawed and partial notion of public\nopinion is irresponsible. Certainly, the argument is hard to resist that public\nconfidence in the law must be maintained. It is also hard to resist the\nproposition that public confidence in sentencing is low and probably falling.\nHowever, since the causes of this lie not in sentencing practice but in\nmisinformation and misunderstanding, and (arguably) in factors only\ndistantly related to criminal justice, ratcheting up the sentencing tariff is\nhardly a rational way of regaining public confidence.\nThis is not to deny that there is political capital to be made, at least in\nthe short term, by espousing sentencing policies which have the trappings\nof tough, decisive action. However, the underlying source of public\ncynicism will not have been addressed; and once politicians embark on this\nroute, they may be committing themselves long-term to a treadmill of\ntoughness, \"decisiveness\", and high public expenditure. The political costs\nof withdrawing from tough policies, once embarked on, may be too high for\npoliticians of any hue to contemplate. The United States serves as an\nexample.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n23 [1996] Crim LR 786\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nF. The Crime (Sentences) Bill: Mandatory and Minimum Custodial\nSentences\nPart I of the Crime (Sentences) Bill is designed to introduce automatic life sentences for\npeople convicted on more than one occasion of one or more of a number of specified\noffences. It is also intended to introduce mandatory minimum sentences on people convicted\nof more than two Class A drug trafficking offences or more than two domestic burglaries.\nAutomatic Life Sentences\nUnder Clause 1, the court will be required to impose a life sentence on a person convicted\nof a serious offence committed after the commencement of this provision who, at the time\nwhen that offence was committed, was 18 or over and had been convicted in any part of the\nUnited Kingdom of another serious offence, though not necessarily the same offence as that\nwith which he has subsequently been convicted. The earlier offence may have been committed\nbefore the commencement of this provision. Offenders sentenced under these provisions will\nbe considered to be serving discretionary rather than mandatory life sentences,24 which will\nhave a bearing on the procedures used in determining when and whether they should be\nreleased.\nIn the White Paper Protecting the Public the Government describes the \"key elements\" of\nhow this provision is intended to work:25\n any previous convictions for relevant offences will count as qualifying\nconvictions, including convictions as a young offender, convictions prior\nto commencement and convictions which are 'spent' under the\nRehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974;\n the automatic life sentence must be imposed where the second conviction\nrelates to an offence which was committed after commencement. The\noffender must also have been at least 18 years old at the time of that\noffence. The second conviction must also relate to an offence which was\ncommitted after the offender was convicted for a previous qualifying\noffence. An offender with no previous convictions who was convicted\nof two qualifying offences at the same court appearance would not\ntherefore be liable to an automatic life sentence:\n the two qualifying convictions need not relate to the same offence, or\ntype of offence. One conviction for a violent offence and one conviction\nfor a sexual offence would suffice. Serious sexual offences, such as\nrape, are also inherently violent offences;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n24 see Clause 1(4)\n25 Cm 3190 p48\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\n the procedures governing tariff and release in these cases will be the\nsame as those which currently apply to the discretionary life sentence\n(which are set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1991). This means that the\ntrial judge will specify the tariff to be served for retribution and\ndeterrence. At the end of that period the Parole Board will determine\nwhether it is safe to release the offender. Ministers will play no part in\nthis process;\n the court will also have discretion not to pass the automatic life sentence\nin genuinely exceptional cases. This is intended to allow for occasional\nquite unforeseeable circumstances where it would plainly be unjust and\nunnecessary to impose the life sentence. But it should be emphasised\nthat this provision will be designed to cover only genuinely exceptional\ncases. The court will be required to explain what were the exceptional\ncircumstances which justified some other sentence in place of a life\nsentence; and\n if released, an offender who has served an automatic indeterminate\nsentence will remain,.on licence and subject to recall for the rest of his\nor her life.\nThe \"Serious Offences\"\nClause 1(5) of the Bill provides that an offence committed in England and Wales will be a\n\"serious offence\" for the purposes of Clause 1 if it is one of the following offences:\n(a) an attempt to commit murder, a conspiracy to commit murder or an\nincitement to murder;\n(b) an offence under section 4 of the Offences Against the Person Act\n1861 (soliciting murder);\n(c) manslaughter;\n(d) an offence under section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act\n1861 (wounding, or causing grievous bodily harm, with intent);\n(e) rape or an attempt to commit rape;\n(f) an offence under section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956\n(intercourse with a girl under 13);\n(g) an offence under section 16 (possession of a firearm with intent to\ninjure), section 17 (use of a firearm to resist arrest) or section 18\n(carrying a firearm with criminal intent) of the Firearms Act 1968; and\n(h) robbery where, at some time during the commission of the offence, the\noffender had in his possession a firearm or imitation firearm within the\nmeaning of that Act.\n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nAn offence committed in Northern Ireland will be a \"serious offence\" for the purposes of\nClause 1 if it is one of the following offences, set out in Clause 1(7):\n(7) An offence committed in Northern Ireland is a serious offence for the\npurposes of this section if it is any of the following, namely-\n(a) an offence falling within any of paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection\n(5) above;\n(b) an offence under section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act\n1885 (intercourse with a girl under 14);\n(c) an offence under Article 17 (possession of a firearm with intent to\ninjure), Article 18(1) (use of a firearm to resist arrest) or Article 19\n(carrying a firearm with criminal intent) of the Firearms (Northern\nIreland) Order 1981; and\n(d) robbery where, at some time during the commission of the offence,\nthe offender had in his possession a firearm or imitation firearm\nwithin the meaning of that Order.\nThe offence of attempted murder in England and Wales and Northern Ireland requires proof\nof nothing less that an intention to kill and is harder to prove in this respect than the offence\nof murder, for which a person must have intended to kill or to cause serious bodily harm.\nThe definition of the offence under Section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861\nof wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent has, like the definitions in the 1861\nAct of other non-fatal violent offences26, been much criticised by the judiciary, legal\nacademics and the Law Commission for its complicated, obscure and old-fashioned language,\ntechnical complexity and unintelligibility to the layman or average juror. In a report on\nLegislating the Criminal Code:Offences Against the Person and General Principles27 the Law\nCommission noted that the need for extensive judicial interpretation had effectively turned\nSections 18, 20 and 47 of the 1861 Act into common law crimes, the content of which is\ndetermined by case-law and not by statute. This, the Commission noted was unsatisfactory,\nboth because the extent of these important offences ought to be determined by Parliament,\nand because, on a more practical level , there were needless hazards in directing a jury on the\nbasis of judicial pronouncements rather than a clear statutory text.\nThe Law Commission recommended that Sections 18, 20 and 47 of the 1861 Act be replaced\nby three offences of intentionally causing serious injury to another, recklessly causing serious\ninjury to another and intentionally or recklessly causing injury to another an offence of assault\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n26 such as assault occasioning actual bodily harm and causing grievous bodily harm\n27 Law Com No. 218\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nand a number of other more specific offences involving violence. The definition of \"injury\"\nproposed by the Law Commission was \"a) physical injury, including pain, unconsciousness,\nor any other impairment of a person's physical condition or b) impairment of a person's\nmental health\" The report, which is part of the Law Commission's long-term project to update\nand consolidate the criminal law in a criminal code, has not been implemented. \nAn offence committed in Scotland will be a \"serious offence\" for the purposes of Clause 1\nif it is one of a number of qualifying offences, set out in a new Section 205A of the Criminal\nProcedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which is to be inserted by Clause 1 of the Crime and\nPunishment (Scotland) Bill 1996/97. The \"qualifying offences\" are as follows:\n1. Culpable homicide.\n2. Attempted murder, incitement to CO@t murder or conspiracy to commit\nmurder.\n3. Rape or attempted rape.\n4. Sodomy or attempted sodomy where, in either case, one party does not\nconsent.\n5. Assault, where the assault-\n(a) is aggravated because it was carried out to-\n(i) the victim's severe injury; or\n(ii) the danger of the victim's life; or\n(b) was carried out with an intention to rape or to ravish the victim.\n6. Robbery, where at some time during the commission of the offence, the\noffender had in his possession a firearm or an imitation firearm.\n7. Any Offence committed by contravention of-\n(a) section 16 (possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or\ncause serious injury);\n(b)  section 17 (use of firearm to resist arrest);or\n(c) section 18 (possession of a firearm for purpose of committing an\noffence listed in Schedule 2), of the Firearms Act 1968.\n8. Lewd, libidinous or indecent behaviour or practices towards a child.\n9. Any offence committed by contravention of section 5(1) of the Criminal\nLaw (Consolidation)(Scotland) Act 1995 (unlawful intercourse with a girl\nunder the age of thirteen years).\n29\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nAll of the \"serious offences\" are currently punishable by life imprisonment.\nMandatory Minimum Sentences\nDomestic Burglary\nClause 3 will require a court dealing with an offender convicted of a domestic burglary28\ncommitted after the commencement of this provision to impose a custodial sentence of at least\nthree years on the offender if, at the time when that burglary was committed he was 18 or\nover and had been convicted in England and Wales (but not Scotland or Northern Ireland)\nof two other domestic burglaries, where one of those burglaries had been committed after he\nhad been convicted of the other and where both had been committed after the commencement\nof this provision.\nThe White Paper describes how the key elements of how this provision is intended to work:29\n it will apply to offences of burglary or aggravated burglary of a dwelling;\n any previous convictions for relevant offences committed after\ncommencement (but not before commencement) will count as qualifying\nconvictions, including convictions as a young offender and convictions\nwhich are 'spent' under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974;\n the mandatory minimum sentence must be imposed where the three\nqualifying convictions all relate to offences committed after the new\nlegislation has come into force. Previous convictions imposed before the\nlegislation comes into force will not therefore 'count' as qualifying\nconvictions. The offender must also have been at least 18 years old\nwhen he or she committed the final qualifying offence (although not\nnecessarily the first two);\n the three qualifying convictions must relate to separate court appearances.\nEach of the qualifying convictions must relate to an offence committed\nafter, the previous conviction. This means that if an offender with no\nprevious convictions was convicted of three offences of burglary at one\ncourt appearance, or two offences at one appearance and a third on a\nseparate occasion, that would not trigger a mandatory minimum sentence;\n where an offender is liable to a mandatory sentence, the court will be\nrequired to impose a sentence of at least 3 years. However the\nmandatory minimum sentence is just that: a minimum. The court will\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n28 defined in Clause 3(5) as \"a burglary committed in respect of a building or part of a building which is a dwelling\"\n29 Cm 3190 p52-53\n30\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nretain the discretion to impose a higher sentence in appropriate cases;\n the court will also have discretion not to pass the mandatory minimum\nsentence in genuinely exceptional cases. This is intended to allow for\noccasional quite unforeseeable circumstances where it would plainly be\nunjust and unnecessary to impose the mandatory sentence. But it should\nbe emphasised that this provision will be designed to cover only\ngenuinely exceptional cases ' it will certainly not be open to the courts\nto set aside the mandatory sentence merely because it is higher than the\nsentence they would otherwise have been minded to impose. The court\nwill be required to explain what were the exceptional circumstances\nwhich justified setting aside the mandatory sentence; and\n if an offender who has already received a mandatory sentence is\nconvicted of a fourth or subsequent offence, which was committed after\nthe mandatory sentence was imposed, he or she will receive a further\nmandatory sentence. In such cases it may be appropriate for the court\nto consider imposing a higher sentence than the mandatory minimum.\nSome commentators have suggested that the omission of convictions in Scotland and Northern\nIreland from the previous convictions which will count towards a minimum three-year\ncustodial sentence will encourage burglars from England and Wales to commit offences in\nthese other jurisdictions. There are no current proposals to impose such minimum sentences\non recidivist burglars in Scotland. The courts will not be required to impose minimum\nsentences on burglars whose previous offences occurred before the minimum penalty was\nimplemented. This contrasts with the position concerning automatic life sentences under\nclause 1 and minimum sentences for drug traffickers under clause 2.\nThe age of burglars and the frequency of their offending\nThe ages of criminals are not known until they are caught so the only regular information\navailable on the ages of burglars is based on those who are found guilty by the courts or\ncautioned by the police. These may not be representative of burglars as a whole, as the age\ndistribution of those who are not caught may differ from those who are. Of the 45,800\noffenders found guilty or cautioned for burglary30 in England and Wales in 1995, 3,800 (8%)\nwere aged between 10 and 13, 13,900 (30%) were aged between 14 and 17, 9,200 (20% )\nwere aged between 18 and 20 and 18,900 (41%) were 21 or more31. 39 per cent of all those\nconvicted for or cautioned for burglary were, therefore, below the age of 18, the youngest age\nfor which the Bill prescribes mandatory minimum sentences for burglary. In 1994, the latest\nyear for which figures for domestic burglary only have been published, 35% of those\nconvicted or cautioned32 were aged under 1833.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n30\n Domestic and non-domestic.\n31\n Home Office Statistical Bulletin 16/96 Table 4.\n32\n 25% of those convicted and 83% of those cautioned were aged under 18.\n31\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nIt is not at present possible to say much about the numbers of offences committed by these\noffenders. Burglars in different age groups may, on average, commit different numbers of\nburglaries; this means that the age distribution of known offenders does not necessarily reflect\nthe numbers of offences they commit. Just because 35% of known domestic burglars are\naged under 18 does not necessarily mean that 35% of burglaries are committed by people of\nthat age, because younger offenders may carry out more, or fewer, burglaries on average than\nthose in older age groups. Little is known about the numbers of particular offences\ncommitted by offenders although some evidence for younger people - aged 14 to 25 - is to\nbe found in a recent Home office study of self-reported offending in England and Wales.\nMore than half of the active offenders (52% of males and 66% of females) surveyed\ncommitted only one or two property34 offences in the year before the survey (1992). 16% of\nmales offenders and 25% of females committed 3 to 5 property offences, 18% of males and\n3% of females committed 6 to 10 and 15% of males and 6% of females committed eleven\nor more35.

More generally, however, the limited evidence that exists for all offending (not\njust specific offences) suggests that the rate of offending among active offenders is fairly\nconstant through all age groups43. \nTrafficking in \"Class A\" Drugs\nClause 2 will require a court dealing with an offender convicted of a class A drug trafficking\noffence44 committed after the commencement of this provision to impose a custodial sentence\nof at least seven years on the offender if, at the time when the offence had been committed\nhe was 18 or over and had been convicted in any part of the United Kingdom of two other\nclass A drug trafficking offences. One of those other offences will have to have been\ncommitted after he had been convicted of the other. Unlike the provisions in Clause 3\nconcerning burglary it will not be necessary for both of the previous offences to have been\ncommitted before the commencement of this provision. In some cases the courts may\ntherefore be required to impose a sentence of at least seven years on a person convicted of\na class A drug trafficking offence where one of the previous convictions resulting in the court\nbeing required to impose this sentence occurred before the current Bill was implemented.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n41\n Includes theft as well as burglary.\n42\n John Graham & Benjamin Bowling Young people and crime (Home Office Research Study 145, 1995) Table 2.5.\n43\n Roger Tarling Analysing offending (HMSO 1993) page 56.\n44 defined in Clause 2(5) as a drug trafficking offence within the meaning of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994, the\nProceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act 1995 or the Proceeds of Crime (Norther Ireland) Order 1996, committed in\nrespect of a drug classified as \"Class A\" within the meaning of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971\n33\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nThe White Paper describes the key elements of how this provision is intended to work:45\n it will apply to drug trafficking offences involving class A drugs\nexcluding simple possession and offences relating to the proceeds of drug\ntrafficking. The principal offences covered by the proposal are therefore:\n- offences of production, supply and possession for supply of class A\ndrugs (sections 4 and 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971);\n- an offence of assisting in or inducing the commission outside the UK\nof an offence relating to a class A drug which is punishable under a\ncorresponding law (section 20 of the 1971 Act);\n- offences of importing or exporting a class A drug (section 3 of the\n1971 Act);\n- offences of manufacturing or supplying certain substances useful for\nmanufacturing controlled drugs or using a ship for illicit traffic in class\nA drugs contrary to the Criminal Justice (International Cooperation)\nAct 1990;\n- an offence of conspiracy to commit any of those offences under s.1 of\nthe Criminal Law Act 1977;\n- an offence of attempting to commit any of these offences under s.1 of\nthe Criminal Attempts Act 1981;\n- an offence of inciting another person to commit any of those offences,\nwhether under section 19 of the 1971 Act or at common law; and\n- aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of any of\nthose offences.\n any previous convictions for relevant offences will count as qualifying\nconvictions, including convictions as a young offender, convictions prior\nto commencement and convictions which are 'spent' under the\nRehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974;\n· the mandatory minimum sentence must be imposed where the third\nqualifying conviction, which triggers the mandatory penalty, relates to an\noffence which was committed after commencement. The offender must\nalso have been at least 18 years old when he or she committed the final\nqualifying offence (although not necessarily the first two);\n· the three qualifying convictions must relate to separate court appearances.\nEach of the qualifying convictions must relate to an offence committed\nafter the previous conviction. This means that if an offender with no\nprevious convictions was convicted of three drug trafficking offences at\none court appearance, or two offences at one appearance and a third on\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n45 Cm 3190 p49-50\n34\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\na separate occasion, that would not trigger a mandatory minimum\nsentence;\n· where an offender is liable to a mandatory sentence, the court will be\nrequired to impose a sentence of at least 7 years. However the\nmandatory minimum sentence is just that: a minimum. The court will\nretain the discretion to impose a higher sentence in appropriate cases;\n· the court will also have discretion not to pass the mandatory minimum\nsentence in genuinely exceptional cases. This is intended to allow for\noccasional quite unforeseeable circumstances where it would plainly be\nunjust and unnecessary to impose the mandatory sentence. But it should\nbe emphasised that this provision will be designed to cover only\ngenuinely exceptional cases-it will certainly not be open to the courts to\nset aside the mandatory sentence merely because it is higher than the\nsentence they would otherwise have been minded to impose. The court\nwill be required to explain what were the exceptional circumstances\nwhich justified setting aside the mandatory sentence; and\n· if an offender who has already received a mandatory sentence is\nconvicted of a fourth or subsequent offence, which was committed after\nthe mandatory sentence was imposed, he or she will receive a further\nmandatory sentence. In such cases it may be appropriate for the court\nto consider imposing a higher sentence than the mandatory minimum.\nSome burglary and drug trafficking offences are triable either way (that is, triable by\nmagistrates or by a judge and jury at the Crown Court). Clauses 2(4) and 3(4) of the Bill\nprovide that where the circumstances are such that, if an offender would, if convicted of one\nof these offences, be required to be given a minimum sentence, the offence shall be triable\nonly on indictment at the Crown Court.\nA court convicting an offender of a \"serious offence\" as defined in Clause 1, or a class A\ndrug trafficking offence or a burglary, will be required, by virtue of Clause 5, to certify that\nthe offender has been so convicted, and this will be evidence, for the purposes of Clauses 1,2\nor 3, that he has been convicted of the offence.\nUnder Clause 4 provides for an appeal against a mandatory sentence imposed under Clauses\n1,2 or 3 where an offender successfully appeals against a previous conviction without which\nthe sentence could not have been imposed. \nExceptional circumstances in which a mandatory sentence need not be imposed\nA court will not be required to impose an automatic life sentence under Clause 1 or a\nminimum sentence under Clause 2 or Clause 3 if it is \"of the opinion that there are\n35\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nexceptional circumstances which justify its not doing so\". However if the court declines to\ndo so it will be required to say so in open court and to state what the exceptional\ncircumstances are. The White Paper states that \"this is intended to allow for occasional quite\nunforeseeable circumstances where it would plainly be unjust and unnecessary\" to impose the\nlife sentence or mandatory minumum sentence, as the case may be. The White Paper\nemphasises, however, that \"this provision is designed to cover only genuinely exceptional\ncircumstances\"46 and in relation to the mandatory minimum sentences for burglary and drug\ndealing states that:\n\"It will certainly not be open to the courts to set aside the mandatory sentence merely\nbecause it is higher than the sentence they would otherwise have been minded to\nimpose.\"47\nParagraph 13 of Schedule 4 of the Bill extends the Attorney-General's powers under Sections\n35 and 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to refer sentences which he considers to be\nunduly lenient to the Court of Appeal to failures by courts to impose life sentences as\nrequired by Clause 1 or the minimum sentences required by Clauses 2 and 3. The judgments\nof the Court of Appeal in these cases will provide some indication of the \"exceptional\ncircumstances\" which might justify a failure to impose a life sentence or a mandatory\nminimum sentence in these cases.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n46 Cm 3190 paras 10.10, 11.3 & 12.7\n47 ibid. paras 11.3 & 12.7\n36\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nII Parole and the Supervision of Prisoners After Their\nRelease\nG. Current arrangements for the early release of offenders under the\nCriminal Justice Act 1991\nThe current statutory provisions concerning parole, which apply to all prisoners sentenced\nafter 1 October 1992, are set out in Part II of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The relevant\nprovisions are summarised in the Report of the Parole Board for 1993 as follows:48\n3. The 1991 Act introduced a new parole scheme to replace the old systems\nof parole and remission. Under the new Act, remission was abolished but\nall prisoners, including young offenders, serving sentences of less than four\nyears are now released automatically at half sentence (unless \"additional\ndays\" have been imposed for breaches of prison discipline). Adults serving\nless than 12 months are not subject to supervision under licence, but all\nyoung offenders and all adults serving sentences of one year to under four\nyears are subject to a period of compulsory supervision.\n4. Prisoners serving sentences of four years or more become eligible for\nparole after having served one half of sentence (subject to any \"additional\ndays\" imposed). All such cases are considered by the Parole Board for\n\"discretionary conditional release\". Those falling into this part of the\nscheme but who are unsuccessful in obtaining parole are automatically\nreleased on licence at the two thirds point of sentence. Thus the \"parole\nwindow\" is reduced to one sixth of sentence, between the one half and two\nthirds points, but all prisoners are subject to a period of supervision, whether\nor not they are granted parole. This new discretionary conditional release\nscheme applies to prisoners sentenced from I October 1992; those sentenced\nprior to October 1992 retain their old parole eligibility dates.\nPrisoners serving determinate sentences of imprisonment of more than twelve months are\nreleased on licence and are therefore subject to supervision, unless the licence is suspended\nor revoked, until they have served what would, but for their release, have been three-quarters\nof their sentence. Prisoners serving sentences of imprisonment of less than twelve months who\nare released early on licence in exceptional circumstances on compassionate grounds under\nsection 36(1) of the 1991 Act are subject to supervision until they have served what would\nhave been half of their sentence, unless the licence is suspended or revoked. Where a prisoner\nserving a life sentence is released on licence, the licence and consequent supervision to which\nhe or she is subject will last until the prisoner's death.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n48 HC 450 27 June 1994 p1\n37\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nA short-term prisoner (that is, a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment of less than four\nyears) who is released on licence but fails to comply with the conditions specified in the\nlicence may be fined up to £1,000 by magistrates, who may also suspend the licence and\norder the prisoner to be recalled to prison for the period of the suspension.49 Where a long-\nterm prisoner (that is, a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment of four years or more)\nor a prisoner serving a life sentence is released on licence the Home Secretary may revoke\nthe licence and recall the offender to prison if this is recommended by the Parole Board. The\nHome Secretary may also revoke such a licence on his own initiative, without the Parole\nBoard's recommendation, if it appears to him that it is expedient in the public interest to recall\nsuch a prisoner before such a recommendation is possible50. The Parole Board's annual\nreports give details of the numbers of licences revoked and prisoners recalled under these\nprovisions. The Board's most recent report was published in October 199651.\nIf a short-term or long-term prisoner released under Part II of the 1991 Act commits an\noffence punishable with imprisonment before the date on which he would, but for his release,\nhave served his sentence in full the court which convicts him may, whether or not it passes\nany other sentence on him, order him to be returned to prison for any period up to a\nmaximum of the length of the period between the date on which the new offence was\ncommitted and the date on which he would have served his sentence in full. This period may\nbe served before and be followed by, or be served concurrently with, the sentence imposed\nfor the new offence.52\nSection 44 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 gives the courts additional powers in respect of\noffenders who are given determinate sentences of imprisonment for sex offences (as defined\nby section 31 of the 1991 Act). It provides that in sentencing such an offender, having had\nregard to the need to protect the public from serious harm, the desirability of preventing the\ncommission of further offences and the securing of his or her rehabilitation, the court may\nextend the duration of the period of supervision to which the offender is to be subject after\nrelease to cover the whole of the sentence which is to imposed, rather than three quarters of\nit. \nThe Home Office publishes National Standards for the Supervision of Offenders in the\nCommunity jointly with the Welsh Office and the Department of Health.

Recent history of parole\nPrior to the implementation of the 1991 Act all prisoners (other than lifers, for whom there\nwere special review and release arrangements and those sentenced as juveniles for particularly\nserious offences under Section 53(2) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933) became\neligible for release on parole once they had served one-third of their total sentences (including\ntime spent on remand) or six months after sentence, whichever was later. Between 1940 and\n1987 prisoners could have one-third of their sentence remitted for good behaviour, while from\n1987 until the implementation in October 1992 of Part II of the Criminal Justice Act 1991\nup to half of a prisoner's sentence was eligible for remission.53 The 1991 Act abolished\nremission and set out the arrangements for early release, described in the previous section of\nthis paper, which have applied to all offenders sentenced to imprisonment since October 1st\n1992. Prisoners sentenced before that date and still in prison are dealt with under the older\nsystem The 1991 Act implemented a number of proposals and recommendations made in the\nreport, published in 1988, of a review committee set up in July 1987 by the then Home\nSecretary, Douglas Hurd.54 On the day the report was published the committee chairman, Lord\nCarlisle of Bucklow, made the following comments about criticisms of the then current\narrangements concerning parole and remission:55\n\"While strongly endorsing the principle that prisoners should be released under supervision\nas the best means of reducing the likelihood of reoffending, the Committee has concluded that\nmany of the criticisms of the present parole system are wholly justified. The gap between\nwhat a judge says and what actually happens in practice has become too great. The system\nmisleads the public and in some cases removes entirely the distinction between sentences of\ndiffering lengths; it creates uncertainty for prison and probation officers; it breeds cynicism\namong offenders; it is unduly secretive and excessively bureaucratic.\nIn its report, the Carlisle Committee noted that in 1940 and in 1987 remission for good\nbehaviour had been used quite explicitly by the Home Secretaries of the day as a means of\nreducing demand for scarce prison places. Thus, as well as being a means of motivating and\ncontrolling individual prisoners, it had been used as a \"safety-valve for the executive in times\nof overwhelming pressure on the prisons\". The committee added that:56\n45. It can also be argued persuasively (see paragraph 22) that from its\ninception 20 years ago parole in this country has had as much to do with\nreducing the overall prison population by executive means as with the\nrehabilitation into society of individual offenders. Instead of grasping the\nnettle of sentencing reform, governments have found it more convenient to\nallow the judges a free hand and to restrain the size of the prison population\nmore covertly. The words of an American academic about the situation in\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n53 This took anyone sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment or less out of the parole system\n54 Cm 532\n55 Home Office Press Notice 25.11.1988\n56 The Parole System in England and Wales - Report of the Review Committee Cm 532 p14\n39\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nthe USA could with only a little modification be applied equally well to\nwhat has happened here: 'In a system that seems addicted to barking louder\nthan it wants [or is able] to bite, a parole system allows judges to appear\ndraconian for the media, knowing that everything will be set quietly to rights\ndown the road'. So to ask how effective parole has been in reducing crime\nand helping offenders to settle back into society is only part of the story.\nIt can perfectly well be argued that provided it has not actually increased\ncrime, harmed offenders or led to an increase in sentences it has still been\nworthwhile because it has kept the prison population a few thousand below\nwhat it would otherwise be and thus saved many millions of pounds as well\nas avoiding a good deal of human misery.\n46. If, however, parole were merely a convenient way for the executive to\nsmuggle people out of prison it would be impossible to avoid asking\nwhether the same end could not be achieved by a more simple and\nstraightforward means. If all that parole showed was that many sentences\ncould be reduced in length without significant risk to the public the logical\ncourse would be to have shorter sentences and dispense with the\ncumbersome machinery necessary for a selective release system.\nThe committee also commented on efforts to measure the effectiveness of remission and\nparole and summarised the results of research on the subject:57\n47. In the nature of things the question is a difficult one since it involves\ntrying to compare the real with the hypothetical. It requires some\nassumption about what might have happened if parole had not been granted\nand vice versa. Although a number of research studies have been carried\nout none has been able, for obvious legal and ethical reasons, to conduct a\ncontrolled experiment with live cases: in other words it has not been possible\nto identify people who appear to constitute a similar risk and grant parole\nto some and not to others to see what effect parole supervision has.\nResearchers have had to analyse past cases and make comparisons on the\nbasis of control groups constructed by statistical means. These techniques\nmake it very difficult to be totally confident about cause and effect.\n48. It is certainly the case that the reoffending rate for those released on\nparole is lower than for those denied parole. For example, a study of 3554\nmales serving more than 12 months from sentence who were discharged in\n1977-9 showed that although, overall, 44% were reconvicted within 2 years,\n34% of those granted parole had been reconvicted as against 59% of those\nwho had been refused parole. But this lower reoffending rate is exactly\nwhat one would in any event expect: it would indeed be alarming if the\nfigures indicated that the Parole Board and LRCs were having no success at\nall in separating the sheep from the goats. What the lower reoffending rate\ndoes not in itself show is that those granted parole would have been more\nlikely to offend if they had instead, been released at a fixed point in their\nsentence, with or without supervision.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n57 ibid p14-15\n40\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\n49. With these caveats some conclusions can, however, be drawn from\nHome Office studies undertaken by Nuttall and others in 1977, the Home\nOffice Statistical Department in 1978 and 1979, Ward in 1987 and\nDitchfield earlier this year:\n(a) first, it is probable that nearly 20% of people on parole reoffend\nwhile on licence. This is much higher than might be deduced from\nthe fact that only about 5% of parole licences are revoked, about\nhalf of these for licence breaches which do not involve reoffending.\nThe under 21s are more likely to reofend than the 21s and over;\n(b) second, the overwhelming majority of offences committed on parole\n(71%) are less serious than the original offence and only a handful\n(5%) are more serious;\n(c) third, although the evidence that releasing people on parole may\nhave a significant long-term effect in preventing reoffending is not\nclear-cut, it is reasonably clear that parole and supervision do\nreduce the likelihood of reoffending in the short-term (though it is\nstill far from clear how the release decision and the provision of\nsupervision interact to produce this effect).\nThis final conclusion may seem a modest basis on which to claim that early\nrelease and supervision help to prevent crime. But there is so little in the\npenal system that can be said with confidence to reduce the likelihood of\nreoffending that even a modest success is to be welcomed.\nA 1977 Home Office Research Study on Parole in England and Wales58 discussed the\n\"failure\" of offenders on parole, amongst other things, and evaluated parole's success in\nreducing further offences. An article from a 1989 Research Bulletin from the Home Office\nResearch and Planning Unit also summarised the results of a study on offending on parole.59\nThe Oxford Centre for Criminological Research is carrying out a three-phase research project\non the effects of the changes in arrangements for early release brought about by the\nprovisions of the 1991 Act. The final results of this project will not be known for some time,\nbut in an article in the February 1996 issue of the Criminal Law Review the researchers said\nthe new criteria had already had the effect of markedly reducing the proportion of prisoners\ngranted parole.60 A Home Office research study of the operation of the automatic conditional\nrelease scheme under the 1991 Act suggested that it was too early to form firm conclusions\nabout the scheme, but that attitudinal measures showed some positive changes in offenders'\nattitudes to offending and to victims. It said an analysis of known reoffending rates among\na small sample of completed licensees indicated that these were well below expected rates,\nalthough this finding needed to be treated with caution as it was likely to reflect some under-\nrecording.61\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n58 Home Office Research Study No. 38 (1977) p65-77\n59 HORPU Research Bulletin No. 26 1989 Chapter 3\n60\n\"Parole Criteria, Parole Decisions and the Prison Population: Evaluating the Impact of the Criminal Justice Act\n1991\" - Roger Hood & Stephen Shute [1996] Crim.

The Crime (Sentences) Bill: New Arrangements for Early Release\nand Supervision \nThe 1996 White paper\nIn a chapter of the White Paper Protecting the Public entitled \"Honesty in Sentencing\" the\nHome Secretary set out the Government's plans to abolish the current arrangements for\nautomatic early release and parole and replace them with new arrangements. Explaining why\nthe Government considers that change is needed the White Paper said :62\n9.3. It is common knowledge that offenders do not serve the term actually\nimposed by the court. There are complicated statutory arrangements which\nprovide for offenders to be released automatically after serving a certain\nproportion of their term-in many cases only 50%. As a result the public,\nand sometimes even the courts, are frequently confused and increasingly\ncynical about what prison sentences actually mean.\nThe Government summarised the changes which it proposed to bring about as follows63\n9.1. The Government proposes that offenders sentenced to custody should\nserve the full term ordered by the court. Automatic early release and parole\nwould therefore be abolished. For the first 12 months of a sentence, or all\nof a sentence of less than 12 months, a prisoner would be able to earn a\nsmall discount of 6 days a month by co-operation with the prison regime.\nBeyond 12 months the prisoner would be able to earn 3 days by co-\noperation and a further 3 days each month for positive good behaviour,\nincluding hard work and effective and diligent I compliance with prison\nprogrammes related to his or her offending behaviour. After release,\noffenders sentenced to 12 months or more would spend a further period\nunder supervision in the community.\nThe White Paper went on to set out how the Government intended the proposed changes to\nwork:64\n9.6. The Government believes that the sentence passed by the court should\nmean what it says. Accordingly the Government proposes that the present\nearly release arrangements should be abolished (although the Parole Board\nwill continue to consider cases involving the release on licence of life\nsentence prisoners). Instead, prisoners will have to earn early release by co-\noperation and positive good behaviour. No part of this will be granted as\nof right it will have to be earned. Behaviour will be continuously assessed\nthroughout the sentence. This is in line with one of the recommendations\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n62 Cm 3190 p43\n63 ibid. p43\n64 ibid. p44\n42\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nin the Learmont Report on prison security as to the positive effects on\nsecurity and control in prisons if prisoners are given a clear incentive to\nbehave well. The key elements of the proposal are as follows:\n it will apply to all offenders aged 16 or over who are convicted of\nan offence committed after commencement for which they receive\na determinate custodial sentence;\n for the first 12 months of a sentence (or all of it if less than 12\nmonths) prisoners will be eligible to earn early release of up to 6\ndays per month by co-operation;\n beyond 12 months prisoners will be able to earn 3 days a month by\nco-operation and a further 3 days by positive good behaviour,\nincluding hard work and effective and diligent compliance with\nprison programmes related to their offending behaviour;\n prisoners' behaviour will be assessed continuously throughout their\nsentence. Every 2 months, they will be eligible to earn a maximum\nof 12 days' early release from their sentence. On this basis, the\nmaximum available remission under the earned early release\nscheme would be 20% of the term of imprisonment originally\nimposed in practice rather less because prisoners by definition\ncould not earn any early release after they had been released;\n days which had already been earned under the new early release\nscheme could be taken away by the governor as a punishment for\noffences against prison discipline up to a maximum of 42 days for\neach offence, as at present;\n it is expected that judges will take into account, when passing\nsentence, the abolition of parole and the changes in early release\narrangements. The Government does not therefore expect the\nproposal to result in a general increase in the period of time\noffenders serve in prison;\n when released under the' new arrangements, all offenders sentenced\nto 12 months or more will rema in under supervision for a period\nrepresenting 15% of the term originally imposed, subject to a\nminimum of 3 months (and irrespective of whether the offender\nearned early release or served his or her term in full). Offenders\nwho breach the conditions of supervision may be brought back to\ncourt, and the court will have power to return them to prison for all\nor part of the remainder of the supervisory period; and\n arrangements for those under 16 would be brought in line with\nthese proposals, except that they would not be subject to a statutory\nscheme of earned early release.\n43\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nThe White Paper set the following additional proposals for change in the arrangements for\ntaking account of time spent on remand in custody:65\n9.7. Consistent with the philosophy of honesty in sentencing, the\nGovernment also proposes to introduce greater transparency into the\narrangements for sentence - calculation. For example, offenders sentenced\nto a term of imprisonment can sometimes be released after a very short\ntime-or even walk out of the court straight away-because of the time they\nhave already spent in custody on remand, without this being apparent when\nthe sentence is announced in court. The Government proposes that when\ndealing with a case where the defendant has been on remand in custody\nbefore his or her trial and sentence, the court should specify the date on\nwhich the sentence should be regarded as having begun, taking account of\ntime already spent in custody on remand. In doing so, it would be open to\nthe court to leave out any time on remand attributable to time wasting by the\ndefendant.\nEarly Release\nThe Crime (Sentences) Bill will repeal the provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 setting\nout the current arrangements for the early release of prisoners. These will be replaced by\nprovisions in Chapter 1 of Part II of the Bill, which are designed to implement the proposals\nset out in the White Paper.\nUnder Clause 6 a person sentenced to imprisonment for an offence after the commencement\nof this part of the Bill will be released when he has served his sentence, unless the provisions\nin this part of the Bill apply.\nUnder Clause 7 the court will give a direction that the time spent by an offender on remand\nin custody will count towards the sentence unless, \"it is in the opinion of the court just not\nto give a direction\" or the case falls within rules which the Home Secretary will have the\npower to make in respect of consecutive or concurrent sentences of imprisonment. These rules\nwill be subject to the affirmative procedure.66 If the court does not give a direction that the\nperiod which an offender spent in custody on remand should count towards sentence, or\ndirects that only part of that period should count, it will be required to state in open court that\nthe decision is in accordance with the rules or state the circumstances which have caused it\nto conclude that it would not be just to give such a direction.\nClause 8 gives the Home Secretary the power to release a prisoner at any time if he is\nsatisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the release on compassionate\ngrounds.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n65 ibid. p45\n66 that is, they will have to be approved by both Houses of Parliament\n44\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nClause 9 of the Bill, which applies where a prisoner is serving a sentence of imprisonment\nof three months or more, provides that:\n9.(1) This section applies where a prisoner is serving a sentence of\nimprisonment for a term of three months or more.\n(2) For each initial assessment period,- the prescribed person may award\nthe prisoner such number of early release days, not exceeding twelve, as he\nmay determine having regard to the extent to which the prisoner's behaviour\nduring the period has attained the prescribed minimum standard.\n(3) For each subsequent assessment period, the prescribed person may\naward the prisoner-\n(a) such number of early release days, not exceeding six, as he may\ndetermine having regard to the extent to which the prisoner's\nbehaviour during the period has attained the prescribed minimum\nstandard; and\n(b) such number of such days, not exceeding six, as he may determine\nhaving regard to the extent to which the prisoner's behaviour during\nthe period has exceeded that standard.\n(4) Where any early release days are awarded to a prisoner, any period\nwhich he must serve before becoming entitled to be released shall be\nreduced by the aggregate of those days; but nothing in this subsection shall\nentitle a prisoner to be released on the basis of an award before the day after\nthat on which the award is made.\n(5) Prison rules may-(a)require determinations ' under this section to be\nmade at prescribed times, and to be notified to the prisoners concerned in\nthe prescribed manner; and\n(b) make provision for enabling prisoners to appeal against such\ndeterminations to prescribed persons.\n(6) The Secretary of State may by order provide that subsections (2)\nand (3) above shall have effect subject to such amendments as may be\nspecified in the order; but no amendment so specified shall reduce-(a)the\nnumber of days specified in subsection (2) or (3)(a); or\n(b) the total number of days specified in subsection (3).\n(7) The power to make an order under this section shall be exercisable\nby statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of\na resolution of either House of Parliament.\nAs far as paragraph (6) of this Clause is concerned it would appear that this is not strictly\nspeaking a \"Henry VIII Clause\" (which enables a minister to amend the provisions of an Act\nby subsequent secondary legislation). It will, however, allow the provisions to be read as if\n45\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nthe numbers of days specified in paragraphs (2) and (3) were to be raised or lowered\n(provided that they do not fall below the numbers actually specified in those paragraphs) and\npermit these paragraphs to be amended in other ways, through subsequent secondary\nlegislation introduced under the negative procedure.\n\"Assessment period\" and \"initial assessment period\" are defined in Clause 9(8) as follows:\n(8) In this section, in relation to a prisoner-\n\"assessment period\" means-\n(a) the period of two months beginning with the day on which he was\nsentenced; and\n(b) each successive period of two months endin before his release;\n\"initial assessment period\" means an assessment period beginning less\nthan twelve months after the day on which he was sentenced and\n\"subsequent assessment period\" shall be construed accordingly.\nClause 11 is designed to enable early release days to be earned and additional days to be\nawarded on a provisional basis to remand prisoners.\nThe \"minimum standard\" and the person who will be empowered to determine whether a\nprisoner has attained that standard and how many early release days he should be awarded,\nwill be prescribed by prison rules made under section 47 of the Prison Act 1952. Rules\nrequiring determinations to be made at prescribed times and notified to the prisoner in a\nprescribed manner, and provisions enabling prisoners to appeal against such determinations,\nand prescribing the person to whom such appeals may be made, will also be made under\nsection 47 of the 1952 Act. Rules made by statutory instrument under this section of the 1952\nAct are subject to annulment under the negative procedure rather than being subject to\napproval by both Houses of Parliament under the affirmative procedure. Under the current\nsystem, this is the case with a number of provisions relating to prisons, including the rules\ngoverning the awarding to prisoners of additional days in custody for disciplinary offences\nunder Section 42 of the Criminal Justice Act 199167. The proportions of their sentences which\ndifferent types of prisoner must serve before being eligible for early release are, however, set\nout in primary legislation. Section 42 of the 1991 Act will be repealed by the current Bill\nand replaced by Clause 10.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n67 which will be repealed by the Bill along with the other provisions of the 1991 Act concerning early release\n46\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nRelease Supervision Orders\nThe provisions in the Bill concerning release supervision orders apply to prisoners sentenced\nfor offences committed after this Chapter of the Bill comes into force.\nClause 12 will require offenders serving sentences of imprisonment of twelve months or more\nand offenders serving sentences of less than twelve months' imprisonment who are released\non compassionate grounds under Clause 8 to be subject to \"release supervision orders\" made\nby the Home Secretary, requiring them to be under the supervision of probation officers and\nto comply with specified conditions. The Home Secretary will be able to specify conditions\nrequiring an offender to live at an approved probation hostel or making \"such provision as\nis made by a curfew order\" if the Parole Board so recommends after an oral hearing at which\nthe offender was heard or represented. (Curfew orders are orders made under section 12 of\nthe Criminal Justice Act 1991 requiring offenders to remain for specified periods at specified\nplaces and making a person responsible for monitoring the offender's whereabouts during the\nspecified periods. Several pilot schemes for the electronic monitoring of offenders subject to\ncurfew orders have been undertaken by the Home Office. They are discussed in Part K of\nthis Paper). The Home Secretary will be able to make rules68 regulating the supervision under\nthis Clause of any description of offenders.\nThe periods for which the supervision orders will be in force will be:\na) For a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment of twelve months or more who is\nreleased other than on compassionate grounds, a period equal to 15% of his term of\nimprisonment or three months, whichever is the greater;\nb) For a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment of less than twelve months who is\nreleased on compassionate grounds, a period equal to as much of the remainder of his term\nas he would have had to serve had he not been released;\nc) For a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment of twelve months or more who is\nreleased on compassionate grounds, a period equal to the aggregate of the periods set out in\nparagraphs a) and b).\nIn assessing these periods account is to be taken of any early release and additional release\ndays awarded to the offender before his release.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n68 by statutory instrument under the negative procedure\n47\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nUnder Clause 13 of the Bill failure to comply with the conditions of a release supervision\norder without reasonable excuse will be an offence punishable, on summary conviction by a\nfine not exceeding £1,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to six months or the remainder\nof the release supervision period, whichever is the shorter, or both, and on conviction on\nindictment by a fine or by a term of imprisonment not exceeding the remainder of the release\nperiod, or both. Under paragraph (2) of Clause 13 it is intended that the offence should be\ntried summarily unless the remainder of the release supervision period is longer than six\nmonths or the act or omission which constitutes the failure to comply is itself an offence\npunishable with imprisonment and triable on indictment. Paragraph 4 of Clause 13 provides\nthat a court should not impose a sentence of imprisonment for the offence of failing to\ncomply with a condition in a release supervision order unless:\na) it considers it expedient to do so in the interests of protecting the public from serious harm\nfrom the offender; or\nb) the offender's failure to comply consisted of the commission of an offence punishable with\nimprisonment.\nClause 14 is intended to enable a constable to arrest without warrant a person he reasonably\nsuspects has committed an offence under Clause 13 and to permit a justice of the peace to\ngrant warrants authorising constables to enter named premises, with force if need be, for the\npurposes of searching for and arresting such a person.\nYoung Offenders\nThe provisions concerning the crediting of remand time, the awarding of early release days\nto convicted offenders and offenders on remand and the imposition of release supervision\norders will, by virtue of Clause 15, apply to young offenders, subject to some modifications.\nIn particular, it is intended that offenders who are under the age of 16, or are detained in local\nauthority accommodation or homes provided by the Secretary of State under section 82(5) of\nthe Children Act 1989, or remanded or committed to local authority accommodation and\nplaced and kept in secure accommodation, should be entitled to the maximum number of early\nrelease days available for each assessment period under Clauses 9 and 11. Under Clause 17,\nthe same entitlement will apply to accused persons who are remanded, admitted or removed\nto hospital under Sections 35, 36, 38 or 48 of the Mental Health Act 1983,and to prisoners\ndetained in hospital under Sections 45A, 47 or 49 of the 1983 Act. Additional provisions in\nthe Bill concerning mentally disordered offenders are dealt with in Library Research Paper\n96/100 on The Crime (Sentences) Bill and the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill:\nProvisions for Mentally-Disordered Offenders.\n48\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nWhere offenders under the age of 22 who have been sentenced, for offences other than\nsexual offences, to detention in a young offenders' institution, or to detention for certain grave\ncrimes under Section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 commit the offence of\nfailing to comply with the conditions of their release supervision orders, they will be liable\nto a shorter maximum period of further detention of 30 days and will not be liable to an\nadditional release supervision order in consequence of this subsequent conviction. \nSexual Offenders\nIn the White Paper Protecting the Public the Government said it considered there was a\nstrong case for strengthening the arrangements for supervising convicted sex offenders\nfollowing their release from custody. The Paper described why the Government took this view\nand the changes it proposed to make:69\n8.9. The current arrangements for dealing with convicted sex offenders still\nleave some concerns:\n sex offenders sometimes have to he released from custody even though\nat the time of release they seem likely to remain an active threat;\n when sex offenders have reached the end of periods of supervision in the\ncommunity, there is no way of monitoring or controlling their activities;\nand\n there are practical difficulties, mentioned at paragraphs 8.6 and 8.7\nabove, in accommodating worthwhile treatment programmes in short\nsentences or short periods of supervision.\n8.10. The proposals in chapter 10 for automatic life sentences for those\nwho repeat serious violent or sexual offences will obviously provide an\nimportant new safeguard. But they will not deal with all the concerns raised\nby this very difficult group of offenders. There is a need to improve\nsupervision arrangements for those released from determinate custodial\nsentences imposed for sex offences. There may also be a need to take\naccount of any recommendations arising from Lord Cullen's inquiry into the\ncircumstances surrounding the tragedy at Dunblane School on 13 March\n1996.\n8.11. The Government is also considering suggestions that convicted sex\noffenders should be required by law to notify the police of any changes of\naddress and prohibited from seeking employment which involves access to\nchildren. There are potential difficulties as well as advantages in these\nsuggestions, which need to be considered in the context of the forthcoming\nWhite Paper on access to criminal records. The Government therefore\nintends to publish a consultation document very shortly canvassing the full\nrange of measures which could improve public protection against sex\noffenders, including additional supervision of offenders following their\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n69 Cm 3190 p41\n49\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nrelease from custody.\nThe Government subsequently published a consultation paper setting out detailed proposals\nfor changes in sentencing and supervision arrangements for people convicted of sexual\noffences against both adults and children.70 In a Written Answer on October 25th 1996 the\nHome Secretary, Michael Howard, said that legislation based on proposals in the consultation\npaper to require paedophiles and other serious sex offenders to notify changes of address to\nthe police would be brought forward by the Government71 and it is expected that this will take\nplace later this session. It had earlier been suggested that these proposals would be brought\nforward through a Private Members' Bill.\nClause 16 of the Crime Sentences (Bill) is intended to provide for the extended supervision\nof sex offenders following their release from custody. It will require a court sentencing an\noffender to a term of imprisonment in respect of a sexual offence to direct that the offender's\nrelease supervision period will be a period of 50% of the term of imprisonment or twelve\nmonths, whichever is the longer, or a longer period of up to ten years, if the court considers\nthat a longer period is necessary for the purpose of preventing the commission by the offender\nof further offences and of securing his rehabilitation. The court will not have to give such a\ndirection if it takes the view that there are exceptional circumstances which justify its not\ndoing so. If the court takes this view it will have to say so in open court and state what these\nexceptional circumstances are.\nThe sexual offences to which Clause 16 is intended to apply are those defined by Section 31\nof the Criminal Justice Act 1991. These offences are listed in an annex to the consultation\npaper Sentencing and Supervision of Sex Offenders as follows:72\nOffences under the Sexual Offences Act\n1956\ns1 Rape (or attempted rape)\ns2 Procurement (or attempted procurement) of a woman by threats\ns3 Procurement of a woman by false pretences\ns4 Administering drugs to obtain or facilitate intercourse\ns5 Intercourse (or attempted intercourse) with a girl under 13\ns6 Intercourse (or attempted intercourse) with a girl between 13 and 16\ns7 Intercourse (or attempted intercourse) with a defective woman\ns9 Procurement of a defective woman\ns10 Incest (or attempt to commit incest) by a man against a female\nsll Incest (or attempt to commit incest) by a woman\ns12 Buggery (or attempt to commit buggery)\ns13 Indecency between men\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n70 Sentencing and Supervision of Sex Offenders Cm 3304 June 1996\n71 HC Deb Vol 284 c14 (W) 25.10.1996\n72 Cm 3304 Annex A\n50\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\ns14 Indecent assault on a woman\ns15 Indecent assault on a male\ns16 Assault with intent to commit buggery\ns17 Abduction of a woman by force for the sale of her property\ns19 Abduction of an unmarried girl under 18 from her parent or guardian\ns20 Abduction of an unmarried girl under 16 from her parent or guardian\ns21 Abduction of a defective woman from her parent or guardian\ns22 Causing (or attempting to cause) prostitution of a woman\ns23 Procuration (or attempted procuration) of a girl under 21\ns24 Detention of a woman in brothel or other premises\ns25 Permitting a girl under 13 to use premises for intercourse\ns26 Permitting a girl between 13 and 16 to use premises for intercourse\ns27 Permitting a defective woman to use premises for intercourse\ns28 Causing or encouraging prostitution of, intercourse with, or indecent assault on, a girl under 16\ns29 Causing or encouraging prostitution of a defective woman\ns32 Solicitation by a man\n[Sections 8 and 18 are no longer in force]\nOffences under the Indency with Children Act 1960\nsl Indecent conduct towards a child under 14\nSexual Offences Act 1967\ns2 Homosexual acts on merchant ships\nCriminal Law Act 1977\ns54 Inciting a girl under 16 to have incestuous sexual intercourse\nProtection of Children Act 1978\nsl Various Offences in connection with indecent photographs of children\nThe offences of buggery, indecency between men, solicitation by a man and homosexual acts\non merchant ships may be committed in circumstances where both the accused person and\nthe \"victim\" were consenting adult males. In the consultation paper the Government said:73\n\"The definition of qualifying sexual offences should be no narrower than in Section 31,\nbearing in mind that the extended supervision powers would be triggered only in cases where\nthe circumstances of the offence led the courts to impose a sentence of imprisonment in the\nfirst place\"\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n73 Cm 3304 para 16\n51\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nReducing sentences to take account of the abolition of parole \nIn the White Paper the Government says that it does not expect the proposals for change in\nthe arrangements for early release to result in a general increase in the period of time\noffenders serve in prison because courts will be expected to take the abolition of parole and\nthe other changes in early release arrangements into account when passing sentence. The\ncourts will thus be expected to reduce the sentence they would otherwise have handed down\nhad the current arrangements persisted, in order to take account of the abolition of parole. The\nWhite Paper notes that this could either be achieved by a Practice Direction if the Lord Chief\nJustice considered such a Direction appropriate, or by a specific statutory provision.74 The\nformer Lord Chief Justice Lord Taylor issued a Practice Direction following the changes in\nthe 1991 Act. This broke with the earlier principle of sentencing policy which held that\nsentencing decisions should be made without reference to questions of remission or parole.75\nClause 21 of the Bill is intended to require courts imposing custodial sentences after the\ncommencement of the Bill on offenders other than repeat burglars or drug dealers for whom\nmandatory minimum sentences will be required under Clauses 2(2) and 3(2), to take into\naccount the abolition of parole and automatic early release and impose terms corresponding\nto the proportions of the terms which those offenders would have had to serve before being\nentitled to be released under the automatic early release provisions of the Criminal Justice Act\n1991.\nJ. Life Sentence Prisoners and Juveniles detained during Her\nMajesty's Pleasure \nThe current Bill will repeal the provisions in Section 34 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991\nunder which the Home Secretary is required in certain circumstances to release a discretionary\nlife sentence prisoner (a prisoner serving a life sentence for an offence for which this is the\nmaximum penalty) on licence if the Parole Board directs that the prisoner be released. It will\nalso repeal provisions in Section 35 of the same Act under which the Home Secretary may\nrelease a mandatory life sentence prisoner (effectively a prisoner serving a life sentence for\nmurder) on licence after having referred the prisoner's case to the Parole Board, received a\nrecommendation that he or she be released and consulted with the Lord Chief Justice and the\ntrial judge if the latter is available.\nIn a couple of recent cases the arrangements for setting the tariff for young offenders\nsentenced to detention during Her Majesty's Pleasure have been criticised by the European\nCourt of Human Rights and the Court of Appeal respectively.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n74 ibid. p43\n75 [1992] 1 WLR 948\n52\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nOn February 21 1996 the European Court of Human Rights issued judgments in the cases of\nSingh v the UK and Hussain v UK, which were both concerned with the detention of young\noffenders convicted of murder when under the age of 18 and consequently sentenced under\nSection 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 to be detained \"during Her\nMajesty's pleasure\". The European Court held that there had been a violation of the European\nConvention on Human Rights in both of these cases in that, after their \"tariffs\" had expired\n(that is, the periods of detention which it was decided the applicants should serve in order to\nsatisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence), the applicants were unable to bring the\nquestion of their continued detention before a court with the powers and procedural\nguarantees satisfying Article 5(4), which provides that:\n\"Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take\nproceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a\ncourt and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful\".\nIn answer to one of a series of Oral Questions from Lord Longford on February 28 1996,\nasking for the Government's response to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights\nin this case the Lord Advocate, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon said:76\nThe noble Earl raises the question of how many people\nmay be affected. My information is that in England and\nWales some 235 cases are potentially affected by the\njudgment. While each and every one of these cases is\nbeing looked at urgently, it is likely that primary\nlegislation will be required to set up the new procedure.\nIn the interim, before primary legislation is passed, cases\nwhere the tariff has expired will be dealt with on an\nadministrative basis.\n \nThe European Court ruling was concerned with the continued detention of juveniles detained\nduring Her Majesty's pleasure after their \"tariff\" had expired. It was not concerned with\nwhether or not the Home Secretary was entitled to set the tariff of juveniles sentenced to\ndetention during Her Majesty's pleasure or with the appropriateness of the tariff imposed in\na particular case. These matters were, however, raised in an application for judicial review\nconcerning the tariffs imposed on Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, the two boys\nconvicted of the murder of James Bulger. In this case, decided on May 2 1996, the High\nCourt quashed the 15-year tariff imposed by the Home Secretary, holding that he had erred\nin applying the same practice in fixing the tariff to be served by children detained during Her\nMajesty's pleasure as was applied to adult prisoners subject to mandatory life sentences\nfollowing convictions for murder. On July 30th 1996 the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal\nby the Home Secretary against this decision and, held that the Home Secretary's decisions\nfixing the period which would elapse before the two child offenders were to be considered\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n76 HL Deb Vol 569 c.1455 28.2.1996 \n53\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nfor release were vitiated by unfairness.77 It was reported that Robert Thompson and Jon\nVenables had also lodged applications with the European Court of Human Rights concerning\nboth the setting of the tariff and the use of trial by jury in their case.78\nPress reports in the aftermath of the High Court decision in the case involving Robert\nThompson and Jon Venables stated that the Home Secretary had suggested that he would, if\nnecessary, introduce legislation to overturn the decision.\nChapter II of Part II of the Bill makes new provision for the release of discretionary and\nmandatory lifers, including those, like the boys convicted of the murder of James Bulger, who\nwere under 18 when the offence for which they received a life sentence was committed.\nClause 23 is intended to require the Home Secretary to release:\ni) mandatory and discretionary life sentence prisoners who were under 18 when the offence\nwas committed; and\nii) discretionary life sentence prisoners in respect of whom the sentencing court ordered the\nprovisions to apply\n \nwhen directed to do so by the Parole Board.\nIt would appear from the complex wording of Clause 23 that it is intended that the courts\nshould give directions specifying a period of custody to be served by such prisoners to take\naccount of the seriousness of the offence and other associated offences, if any, as well as any\ntime spent in custody on remand. Once this period has been served the Home Secretary will\nbe able and may be required to refer the prisoner's case to the Parole Board, which may direct\nhis release if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that\nhe be confined. Paragraph (7) of Clause 23 provides that a life sentence prisoner to whom the\nClause applies may require the Home Secretary to refer his case to the Parole Board at any\ntime - \n(a) after he has served the relevant part of his sentence; and\n(b) where there has been a previous reference of his case to the Board,\nafter the end of the period of two years beginning with the disposal of\nthat reference; and\n(c) where he is also serving a sentence of imprisonment or detention for\na term, after the time when, but for his life sentence, he would be\nentitled to be released;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n77 R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Venables and Thompson - Times Law Report 7.8.1996\n78\n\"Howard's sentence on child killers 'unlawful'\" - Guardian 18.4.1996\n54\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nClause 24 is intended to give the Home Secretary a power, but not a duty, to release other\nlife sentence prisoners (that is, prisoners given life sentences for murder who were over 18\nwhen the offence was committed and discretionary lifers in respect of whom the courts have\nnot ordered that Clause 23 should apply) if recommended to do so by the Parole Board after\nconsultation with the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge if available. The Parole Board will\nonly be able to make such a recommendation if the Home Secretary has referred the particular\ncase, or the class of case to which it belongs, to the Parole Board for its advice. Arrangements\nfor the release of these life sentence prisoners will be the same as those which currently apply\nunder Section 35 of the 1991 Act.\nClause 25 will permit the Home Secretary to release life prisoners on licence if he is satisfied\nthat exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner's release on compassionate\ngrounds. Before exercising this power the Home Secretary will be enquired to consult the\nParole Board, unless this is impracticable in the circumstances\nLife sentence prisoners released on licence under these provisions will be liable to be recalled\nunder Clause 27 if their licence is revoked by the Home Secretary on the recommendation\nof the Parole Board or where it appears to the Home Secretary that this is expedient in the\npublic interest before such a recommendation is practicable. In the latter circumstances the\nprisoner's case will be referred to the Parole Board, but otherwise this will only happen if the\nprisoner makes written representations with respect to his recall. On their return to prison\nrecalled lifers will be informed of the reasons for their recall and of their right to make\nrepresentations.\nSeveral reports, including the Report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Murder and\nLife Imprisonment,79 the Report of the Committee on the Penalty for Homicide80 and the report\nof the Home Affairs Committee on Murder: The Mandatory Life Sentence (Supplementary\nReport)81 have recommended that responsibility for setting the tariff (the period which must\nbe served to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence before a life sentence\nprisoner can be considered for release) and taking decisions on the release of prisoners\nserving mandatory life sentences for murder be taken away from the Home Secretary. (The\nfirst two of these reports also recommended that the mandatory life sentence for murder be\nabolished). In its response to the Home Affairs Committee's recommendation the Government\nsaid that a move to take this responsibility away from the Home Secretary would be\nundesirable because:82\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n79 HL Paper 78 Session 1988-89\n80 a report published in 1993 of an independent inquiry commissioned by the Prison Reform Trust, chaired by the\nformer Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane\n81 Home Affairs Committee Second Report 1995/96 HC 412\n82 The Government Reply to the First and Second Reports from the Home Affairs Committee Session 1995-96 HC\n111 and HC 412 - Murder: The Mandatory Life Sentence Cm 3346 p1 \n55\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\na) it could reduce public confidence in the criminal justice system\nb) it would prevent direct accountability to Parliament for decisions on length of tariff and\nrelease for murders\nc) it would limit the perspectives brought to the decisions on tariff and release\nd) it could signal that murder was no longer regarded as a uniquely heinous crime.\nK. Alternative penalties for fine defaulters and others convicted of\nminor offences\nElectronic Monitoring of Offenders\nIn a Green Paper published in July 1988 entitled Punishment, Custody and the Community83\nthe Government asked whether it might be useful for the courts to have powers to make\ncurfew orders, confining people to their homes at certain times. It was suggested that these\ncould be enforced through electronic monitoring of the people who were subject to such\norders. A pilot project on the use of electronic monitoring for defendants remanded on bail\nawaiting trial who would otherwise have been remanded in custody was carried out by the\nHome Office in 1989-90. This particular group was chosen for the study because electronic\nmonitoring devices could be used as a condition of bail without the need for primary\nlegislation, which was not the case with convicted offenders. The report of the study of the\npilot project was published in 1990.84 In the concluding chapter of the report of the study, the\nresearchers noted that:85\nMagistrates and judges generally did not seem to have\nmuch confidence in the applicability of electronic\nmonitoring as an alternative to a remand in custody, and\ncommented on the difficulties of finding suitable\ncandidates for it. They were willing to countenance a trial\nwith a limited time-span, but if monitoring were to be\nintroduced on any national basis then much greater\nconfidence in the system on the part of both these groups\nwould be vital.\nThey also made the following observations about the views of the people who had been\nmonitored during the study:86\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n83 Cm 424\n84 Electronic Monitoring: The Trials and Their Results - Home Office Research Study 120 p.1-16 & p.63-68\n85 Ibid., 120 p.65\n86 HORS 120 p.68\n56\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nOne key point to note is that, generally, those who were\nmonitored preferred it to custody though they also found\nit to be restrictive and demanding, A significant minority,\nhowever, said that they would not choose monitoring\nagain; it was too rigorous and it would not be deducted\nfrom a custodial sentence. More knowledge for potential\ncandidates in advance of consenting to be monitored\nwould be helpful.\nAn account of the pilot study of electronic monitoring in England and Wales in 1989-90 by\nthe researchers involved, George Mair, is set out in Michael Tonry and Kate Hamilton's 1995\nbook Intermediate Sanctions in Overcrowded Times.87\nIn a 1990 White Paper88 Crime, Justice and Protecting the Public the Government announced\nproposals for new legislative provisions to enable the courts to make a curfew order, either\nas a condition of bail or as a penalty following conviction. The White Paper noted that;89\nSubject to the outcome of the experimental projects and on\nevaluation of the costs of electronic monitoring, curfews\ncould be enforced by electronic monitoring. A separate\npower would be needed to enable the courts to order\nelectronic monitoring to enforce a curfew order.\nStandards for the equipment and schemes of operation\nwould have to be approved by the Secretary of State.\nProvisions designed to introduce the new 'curfew order', which could be imposed as a\nsentence on convicted offenders who were aged sixteen or over and would require the\noffender to remain at a specified place for specified periods, were introduced by Section 12\nof the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Section 13 of the 1991 Act provides that a curfew order\nmay include requirements for securing the electronic monitoring of the offender's whereabouts\nduring the curfew periods specified in the order. Such requirements may not, however be\nimposed unless the court has received official notification from the Home Secretary that\nelectronic monitoring arrangements are available the area in which the place to be specified\nin the curfew order is situated, and is satisfied that the necessary provision can be made under\nthese arrangements. Section 13 of the 1991 Act include provisions enabling electronic\nmonitoring arrangements to be contracted-out by the Home Secretary.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n87 p.116-120\n88 decision document\n89 Cm 965 para 4.23\n57\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nThese general provisions in the 1991 Act concerning curfew orders and the electronic\nmonitoring of offenders subject to them have not been brought into force. They provided for\nthe introduction of curfew orders nationally but did not, it was thought, permit either the\ngradual or the selective introduction of such orders. Paragraph 41 of Schedule 9 of the\nCriminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 introduced an amendment to Section 12 of the\n1991 Act which was intended to enable the curfew order provisions to be introduced and, if\nnecessary, withdrawn in selected areas. This was to enable pilot trials involving electronic\nmonitoring of curfew orders to be conducted in selected areas prior to their more general\nintroduction at a later date.\nTrials of curfew orders and electronic monitoring began in three different areas in July 1995,\ninitially for a period of 9 months. On February 20th 1996 the Home Secretary announced\nthat the trials were to be extended until March 1997 and that the number of courts which had\nthe sentence available to them might be increased.90 Electronic monitoring is thus currently\nused in certain selected parts of the country to enforce curfew orders, which are a form of\nsentence imposed on convicted offenders and can only be imposed as community sentences\nin their own right.\nNew provisions in the Crime (Sentences) Bill\nClause 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Bill is intended to allow a court to impose a community\nservice order or a curfew order, which could be monitored by electronic \"tagging\", as a\npenalty for fine default where the offender is aged 16 or over. Clause 31 will extend the\nupper age limit range for which an attendance centre order may be imposed as a penalty for\nfine default from 21 to 25. Clause 32 is intended to enable courts to impose community\nservice orders or curfew orders rather than fines on persistent petty offenders aged 16 or over\nwhere the court is satisfied that the offender already has outstanding fines and would not have\nsufficient means to pay a further fine which was commensurate with the seriousness of the\noffence of which he or she has just been convicted.\nThese provisions are intended, amongst other things, to reduce the use of imprisonment as a\npenalty for fine default. They were proposed in a consultation paper on Alternative Penalties\nfor Fine Defaulters and Low Level Offenders published by the Home Office in July 1996.91\nIn the paper the Government said that:92\n1.1 The number of fines which are written off because they cannot be\nenforced, and the number of defaulters who are committed to prison - nearly\n20,000 in 1995 - have the net effect of frustrating the court's original\nintention in imposing a fine.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n90 Electronic Monitoring: Extension of Trials P.N.

It is also keen\nto examine measures which would have the effect of reducing the numbers\nof defaulters who go to prison, whilst maintaining the effectiveness of the\nfine enforcement process and ensuring that offenders are punished for their\noffences.\nThe paper went on to make the following observations about the conclusions of a Working\nGroup set up by the Lord Chancellor to look at the enforcement of financial penalties:93\n1.5 The Working Group has identified a case for a new penalty to deal\nwith repeated offenders who, because of outstanding fines, do not have the\nmeans to pay a fine commensurate with the seriousness of their offences.\nThe proposal is for an alternative penalty involving the imposition of\ncommunity service or an electronically monitored curfew.\n1.6 The Working Group has also looked at the scope for giving the\ncourts power to make a Community Service Order (CSO) as an alternative\nsanction for fine default. The Magistrates' Association has already argued\nfor such an extension of the courts' powers. Another option would be to\ngive the courts the power to make curfew orders (supported by electronic\nmonitoring) which are currently only available as community sentences in\ntheir own right. This paper sets out proposals for a new penalty for fine\ndefault, which would offer the courts the option of imposing community\nservice, or a curfew, or both. Views are sought on whether this penalty\nshould be available for default on other financial penalties, excluding civil\ndebts.\nThe consultation paper added that the new powers would be tested through pilots schemes\nin specified geographical areas.\nClause 33 of the Crime (Sentences) Bill will abolish provisions in the Powers of Criminal\nCourts Act 1973 and the Criminal Justice Act 1991 which restrict the imposition of probation\norders to those cases where the offender expresses his willingness to comply and require a\ncourt to obtain an offender's consent before imposing a community service order. Arguments\nfor and against this proposal were set out in the 1995 Green Paper Strengthening Punishment\nin the Community [Cm 2780] and it was discussed further in the consultation paper\nAlternative Penalties for Fine Defaulters and Low Level Offenders.94 Article 4(2) of the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights provide that\n\"No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour\"\nalthough Article 4(3)(a) exempts from this definition\n\"any work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention imposed according to\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n93 ibid. p2\n94 Dep 3827 (35) para. 2.3.6\n59\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nthe provisions of Article 5 of this Convention or during conditional release from such\ndetention\".\nL. Comment on the Government's Proposals on Sentencing and\nEarly Release\nThe proposals in the White Paper for the introduction of automatic life sentences and\nmandatory minimum sentences for certain repeat offences and for the abolition of the current\nstatutory arrangements for parole so soon after their implementation provoked great\ncontroversy.\nIn debate in the House of Lords on the Government's proposals the former Lord Chief Justice\nLord Taylor of Gosforth said that minimum sentences necessarily involved a denial of justice\nand criticised the evidence, including the statistics on which the changes and the justifications\nfor them were based:95\nTurning to the White Paper, I venture to suggest\nthat never in the history of our criminal law have\nsuch far-reaching proposals been put forward on the\nstrength of such flimsy and dubious evidence. The\nshallow and untested figures in the White Paper do\nnot describe fairly the problems the Government\nseek to address. Still less do they justify the\nradical solutions it proposes.\nBut I wish to emphasise at the outset that my\nopposition to these proposals does not arise from\nany entrenched views on government policy, still\nless-although the press like to suggest otherwise-\nfrom any personal animosity towards the Home\nSecretary. I have, as he has acknowledged,\nsupported a number of the measures he has\nintroduced-for example, allowing juries to draw\ninferences from the defendant's silence, removing\nthe requirement for corroboration, and fundamental\nreforms to the law of disclosure.\nFurthermore, I have indicated qualified support\nfor his proposal of \"honesty in sentencing\"; that is\nto say, for a closer correlation between the sentence\npassed by the court and the sentence actually\nserved. But how this is managed requires careful\nthought-which it has not yet received. Simply to\nrequire the Lord Chief Justice by practice direction\nto preside over the general reduction of sentencing\nlevels while Government Ministers are urging\ntougher sentences would cast the judiciary in the\nrole of apparently thwarting the will of Parliament.\nAgain, to make such a reduction without\nsufficiently providing for rehabilitation or incentives\nfor good behaviour would clearly be a mistake.\nBut I leave these issues to others because my main\nconcern centres on the policy of minimum\nsentences set out in the White Paper.\nQuite simply, minimum sentences must involve\na denial of justice. It cannot be right for sentences\nto be passed without regard to the gravity,\nfrequency, consequences or other circumstances of\nthe offending. To sentence a burglar automatically\nto a minimum of three years' imprisonment on a\nthird conviction is to take no account of whether he\nis before the court for only three offences or for 30,\nno account of how long has passed between those\noffences, whether they involved sophisticated\nplanning or drunken opportunism, and a host of\nother factors. To impose a minimum sentence of\nseven years on those convicted for the third time of\ntrafficking in proscribed drugs will simply fill our\nprisons with addicts who sell small quantities to\nsupport their own addiction.\nRecognising the injustice of the proposed policy,\nthe Government have come up with a proposed\npalliative measure. In each of the three categories\nof offence serious sexual and violent offending,\nburglary, and drug trafficking-the White Paper now\nstates that the court will retain the discretion to\ndepart from the obligatory tariff in what are\ndescribed as \"genuinely exceptional cases\". This\nsaving clause did not feature in the original\nproposals for mandatory life sentences and has\nclearly been added to mitigate the manifest injustice\nof the policy. It does not do so. Simply to provide\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n95 HL Deb c1025-1028 23.5.96\n60\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nan \"escape clause\" for the most extreme cases of\ninjustice will not do. It may give some reassurance\nand comfort to those concerned by the enormity of\nthe provisions as propounded, but the result would\nbe the worst of both worlds. Judges would not be\nbound to impose minimum sentences willy-nilly.\nThey would be left with some discretion in\nexceptional cases. But what is an exceptional case?\nIf the escape clause is construed restrictively it will\nhave little effect. That is what happened when\nsuspended sentences were confined to exceptional\ncases. They became in effect a dead letter. If, on\nthe other hand, the escape clause is construed more\nbroadly, it will be said that the judiciary is driving\na coach and horses through the provisions of the\nAct and thwarting Parliament. More fundamentally,\nthe proposal subverts the function of the court,\nwhich is to sentence according to the justice of\neach individual case, not to see whether it can be\naccommodated within a narrow exception and\notherwise to take a sentence off the shelf.\nThe Home Secretary has pointed out that\nParliament can, if it wishes, impose a regime of\nminimum sentences. Of course it can: there has\nnever been any dispute about that. He also says\nthat there would be nothing very novel about its\ndoing so, because we already have a wide range of\nstatutory maximum sentences.\nThere is a world of difference between a\nstatutory maximum sentence, which defines the\nrange within which a judge exercises his discretion,\nand a statutory minimum which prevents any\nproper regard being given to mitigating factors.\nStatutory maximum sentences assist in establishing\na hierarchy of offending. They enable prosecutors\nto charge at an appropriate level. Thus the\nmaximum sentence for common assault is six\nmonths, for assault occasioning actual bodily harm,\nfive years, and for assault occasioning grievous\nbodily harm with intent, life. But this hierarchy in\nno way prevents a judge from instigating sentence\nin the interests of justice.\nThe Home Secretary also says that there is a\nprecedent for his proposal since there is a\ncompulsory penalty of disqualification from driving\nupon conviction for driving under the influence of\ndrink and drugs. I do not think driving a car is a\nfundamental human right. A licence to drive is a\nprivilege granted by the state on condition that it\nwill be exercised responsibly and safely. Its\nwithdrawal is not in any way analogous with being\nput in prison for a substantial period.\nI understand the very real public concern that a\ntiny minority of dangerous criminals with a history\nof serious offending may, under existing\nprocedures, be released when they still represent an\nunacceptable risk to the public. Although the\nnumbers who fall into this category are very small,\nI appreciate the danger they represent and I agree\nthat we should address that problem. One approach\nwould be to re-examine the recommendations of the\n1975 Butler Committee for a reviewable sentence,\nor to look at alternative regimes used in other\njurisdictions. But it is not possible to justify a\nwholesale changeover to a regime of mandatory\nsentences involving (among other things) doubling\nthe number of life sentences passed annually by the\ncourts simply by scaremongering about this very\nsmall number of offenders who could in any event\nbe dealt with in another way.\nIn announcing the publication of the White\nPaper in another place (and again on the radio this\nmorning), the Home Secretary stated:\n\"In 1994, 217 offenders were convicted of a second or\nsubsequent serious violent or sexual offence. All could have\nreceived a life sentence-but only 10 did\".-[Official Report,\nCommons, 3/4/96; col. 389]\nHe did not say how many the Attorney-General had\nreferred to the Court of Appeal as being unduly\nlenient. Presumably the Home Secretary thinks that\nhe should have referred all 207. In fact, he referred\nonly six. The problem is, therefore, nothing like so\ngreat as the White Paper makes out.\nThe proposed minimum sentences for domestic\nburglary lack any sound basis. The figures quoted\nin the White Paper purport to show that the courts\npay insufficient regard to the problem of repeat\noffending and that punishment is not increased for\nfurther criminality. But the figures are woefully\nflawed and simply do not show that.\nFirst of all, part of the sample taken by the\nHome Office relates to that period before 23rd\nAugust 1993 when the judiciary was prevented by\nthis Government's policy under the 1991 Act from\ntaking any account of previous convictions or of\nany other offences save the most recent. To\ncriticise judges for lenient sentencing when during\nthat period they were prevented by statute ,rom\ntaking previous convictions into account is wholly\nunjustifiable.\nSecondly, and contrary to what the White Paper\nstates, even that partial and tainted sample shows\nthat there is a significant increase in sentences for\nfurther offending: 59 per cent. of burglars received\na prison sentence for their first offence; 71 per cent.\nfor their second offence; and 75 per cent. for their\n61\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nthird offence. Those who had already received\ncustodial sentences for burglary recently faced an\nincrease of 2.5 months for a second conviction and\n5.6 months for a third conviction.\nThirdly, and much the most important, the\nfigures do not and cannot take account of the\nenormous variety of criminal conduct encompassed\nwithin offences of burglary. Not only do burglaries\nvary from the opportunistic taking of a milk bottle\nto the systematic looting of a lifetime's possessions,\nbut an individual conviction can include a number\nof other offences taken into account. It is for that\nreason that judges need the ability to tailor the\nsentence to the offence-to make the punishment fit\nthe crime. If there is concern that sentences for\nburglary are inadequate, the Attomey-General's\npower to refer unduly lenient sentences to the Court\nof Appeal should be extended to enable him to\nrefer burglary cases.\nIn the past five years and within the life of this\nGovernment, there has been a spate of legislation in\nthe field of criminal justice. In considering the\npresent White Paper, I invite the closest attention of\nthe House to the previous government White Paper\nof 1990. It merits scrutiny line by line. I quote:\n\"It is not the Government's intention that Parliament\nshould bind the courts with strict legislative guidelines. Ale\ncourts have shown great skill in the way they sentence\nexceptional cases. The courts will properly continue to have\nthe wide discretion they need if they are to deal justly with\nthe great variety of crimes which come before them\".\nPausing there, I profoundly agree with that. I\ncontinue with the quotation:\n\"The Government rejects a rigid statutory framework on\nthe lines of those introduced in the United States or\"-\nmark this, my Lords-\n\"a system of minimum or mandatory life sentences for\ncertain offences\"\nAgain, I profoundly agree. It goes on:\n\"This would make it more difficult to sentence justly\nexceptional cases. It would also result in more acquittals by\njuries with more guilty men and women going free unjustly\nas a result\".\nThose words are not mine. They come from a\nGovernment White Paper some five years ago.\nThey are self-evidently wise, fair and just. I ask\nthe noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor\nwhy every one of those propositions of government\npolicy so recently propounded is now to be\njettisoned and replaced by its exact opposite.\nThe different arguments put forward against the sentencing and early release proposals in the\nWhite Paper were set out in some detail in this debate, which included criticisms from former\nConservative ministers Lord Windlesham and Lord Carlisle of Bucklow (Lord Carlisle chaired\nthe parole review committee whose report formed the basis of the changes to parole in the\n1991 Act). Many senior judges and former judges, including Lord Ackner, Lord Woolf, Lord\nDonaldson, and the Conservative former Lord Chancellor Lord Hailsham have also criticised\nthe proposals, as have the Law Society and the General Council of the Bar. The Parole Board\nset out its detailed criticisms and its particular concern that the proposed new arrangements\nfor the early release of prisoners serving determinate sentences will not allow for adequate\nassessment of the risk posed by those prisoners, in an appendix to its latest annual report.96\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n96 Parole Board Report for 1995 and 1995/96 HC 506 1995/95\n62\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nSome critics of the Government's proposals have expressed concern that convicted rapists\nfacing automatic life sentences for subsequent offences under the Government's proposals\nwould have nothing to lose by killing their victims and thereby removing the principal\nwitnesses to their crimes, because they would suffer the same penalty whether they committed\nmurder or not. They have also suggested that there will be no incentive for a rapist who has\na previous conviction for a \"serious offence\" as defined in Clause 1 to plead guilty and\nthereby spare his victim the ordeal of having to give evidence in court. Rapists who plead\nguilty are generally given reduced sentences to take account of this. A specific statutory\nprovision permitting reductions in sentence to take account of timely guilty pleas was only\nrecently introduced into English criminal law by section 48 of the Criminal Justice and Public\nOrder Act 1994.\nIn a debate in the House of Commons on June 19th 1996 on the Government's sentencing\nproposals the Home Secretary, Michael Howard set out his view of concerns that rapists\nfacing automatic life sentences might kill their victims:97\nMr. Elfyn Llwyd (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I am\nsure that the Home Secretary will forgive me if I take him\nback to the subject of the debate. Has he had an\nopportunity to study what the senior judges, including\nLord Justice Taylor, have said about the dangers inherent\nin life sentences being imposed in the manner proposed by\nthe White Paper-the dangers to the victim himself or, more\nprobably, herself?\nMr. Howard: Of course I have studied that, but I do\nnot accept the views that have been expressed because the\narguments advanced in another place are arguments\nagainst any life sentence. If the hon. Gentleman accepts\nthose views, perhaps he will tell the House whether he is\nagainst any life sentence. If that line of argument is\naccepted, there is an incentive for the offender to take\nmore serious action and even to kill. The truth is that,\nwhen someone commits a rape, he is most unlikely to be\nin the state of mind that will lead him to make a cold and\ncalculating decision about what his next act should be. If\nhe is in that state of mind and makes such a cold and\ncalculating decision, he will know perfectly well that, if\ncaught and convicted, when the judge fixes the tariff part\nof the life sentence, it is likely to be a different tariff for\nrape than for murder. That will be something to be taken\ninto account in planning his behaviour. If he behaves in\nthat cold and calculating way, which is extremely unlikely,\nhe will know that there continues to be a deterrent against\nfurther serious criminal conduct.\nIn the same debate the Home Secretary made the following comments about criticism of his\nproposals:98\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n97 HC Deb Vol 279 c895-896\n98 ibid c891-892\n63\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/99\nPersistent burglars and drug dealers are a menace to\nsociety, and they should know that if they continue to\noffend they will go to prison for a long time. In too many\ncases, non-custodial sentences or very short prison\nsentences are imposed on burglars who have numerous\nprevious convictions. It just cannot be right that burglars\nbefore the court for their seventh or subsequent conviction\nare getting average sentences of 19 months-serving\nperhaps 10 months. That is only a few months longer\nthan the 15 or 16 months-serving perhaps eight months of\nfirst offenders who are sent to prison. Stiff minimum\nsentences will provide a real deterrent to persistent\noffenders and ensure that those who continue to offend\nreceive the punishment that they so richly deserve.\nI do not accept that these proposals encroach\nimproperly on judicial independence. It has always been\nParliament's responsibility to set the statutory framework\nfor sentencing, and for judges to exercise their discretion\nwithin that framework.\nIt has been argued that mandatory sentences will not\nwork because it is the certainty of conviction that deters\noffenders, not the severity of sentence. But improving\ndetection rates and imposing stiffer sentences are not\nalternatives, they are complementary. The most effective\ndeterrent is to have both. The police are taking action to\nimprove detection rates in a number of ways, for example,\nby targeting known and persistent offenders. The\nGovernment's proposals will back that up. Bringing\npersistent burglars back before the courts time and time\nagain is useless if the sentence imposed is one that they\ncan regard as a rriinor occupational hazard in their chosen\ncareer.\nRos Burnett of Oxford university, in a study entitled\n\"The Dynamics of Recidivism\", found on the basis of\ninterviews with prisoners that:\n\"Avoidance of imprisonment was the most frequently mentioned\nreason for not wanting to re-offend\".\nUnder our proposals, persistent offenders will know that\nthey will get a stiff sentence if they persist in offending.\nThe public rightly expect protection from serious,\ndangerous and persistent offenders. The proposals that I\nhave outlined are carefully targeted at crimes of particular\nconcern to the public-serious sex and violent offences,\ndomestic burglary, and dealing in hard drugs. The\nGovermnent believe that urgent action is required to\nprovide a real deterrent to such offenders; to punish\nseverely those who continue to offend regardless; and\nabove all to protect the public from their activities. The\nWhite Paper \"Protecting the Public\", and our new\nproposals for sex offenders and for making better\npreventive use of criminal records, are further steps\ntowards protecting the public in that way.\n64\n\n\nSupporters of the proposals for automatic life sentences have noted that the state authorities\nin California have credited their \"three strikes\" policy with having brought about a fall in the\nrecorded crime rate in that state. Some American commentators have questioned this claim,\nnoting that the crime rates have also fallen in other states which do not have these provisions\nand that drops in crime rates can be attributed to many different factors, such as demographic\nchanges and trends in the consumption of prohibited drugs. Crime rates in the United States\nare very much higher than in the United Kingdom and indeed most other European countries.\n(Reported rates for domestic burglary in the USA are apparently an exception to this - a\nfeature some commentators attribute to the likelihood of an American householder having a\nfirearm at home). The Californian Supreme Court recently ruled that the states \"three strikes\"\nlaw as drafted was not mandatory and newspaper reports suggest that it is likely to be\nredrafted by the state legislature. Statistics on sentencing in the United States are set out in\nthe next chapter of this Paper.\nM. Some relevant statistics\nThe prison population\nThe explanatory memorandum to the Bill estimates that the proposals in Parts I and II for\nmandatory custodial sentences and new early release arrangements would eventually result\nin an increase in the prison population of around 11,000, some twelve years after\nimplementation. This will require about twelve new prisons coming on stream at a rate of\none or two a year from 2001-02 onwards, and would provide 9,600 places, together with 3,00\nnew places to be provided by 2001-02 by building additional houseblocks at existing\nestablishments and by rebuilding and re-opening two existing prisons. \nThe provisions of the Bill will, therefore, lead to a continuation of a long-term trend increase\nin the population in custody. The prison population of England and Wales has more than\ndoubled since 1960 with an increase of 15 per cent in the last two years and nearly 11 per\ncent in the last year alone. Table 1 and the graphs which follow give the figures.\nTable 2 compares the latest available prison populations in selected European countries and\nthe United States. \nSentencing for offences affected by the Bill\nThe white paper gives most but not all of the available information on current sentencing\npatterns for the offences affected by the Bill. This section summarises the figures. Looking\nfirst at the offences for which mandatory life sentences are proposed, it is clear that relatively\nlittle use is made now of discretionary life sentences. For example, of 434 offenders\nconvicted of rape or attempted rape in 1994, only 12 were given life imprisonment. of 217\noffenders convicted of a second serious violent or sexual offence, ten received a discretionary\nlife sentence.\n65\n\n\nThe table below shows the proportion of all those convicted of serious violent and sex\noffences in 1995 who were given custodial sentences, together with the average sentence\nimposed, and also the average sentence imposed on those sentenced for offences carrying a\nmaximum life sentence who had previous convictions for such offences99,100. \nAll sentenced in 1995\nThose with previous\nconvictions for life\nsentence offence\n% given\ncustody\naverage\nsentence\n(years)\naverage\n sentence\n (years)\nAttempted murder 75% 9.4 ..\nThreat/conspiracy to murder 75% 7.6 ..\nManslaughter 89% 4.9 3.8\nWounding with intent to do GBH 83% 3.3 4.1\nRobbery involving use of firearms 89% 5.9 ..\nAll robbery .. .. 3.5\nPossession of firearm with intent 61% 3.0 ..\nRape/attempted rape 89% 6.5 6.8\nUnlawful sexual intercourse with girl\nunder 13 67% 2.8 ..\n  \nFew figures are available on the sentences imposed on those who have been convicted three\nor more times for drug trafficking. A sample of those convicted in three weeks of 1993101\nshowed that 55% of those convicted for the first time for such offences were given a custodial\nsentence with an average sentence of 32 months; 61% of those for whom this was a second\nconviction were sentenced to custody with an average sentence of 25 months; and 75% of\nthose with a third or greater conviction were imprisoned with an average sentence of 30\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n99 The latter data are based on a sample of those convicted of violent offences in five weeks of 1993-94 and are not\nstrictly comparable with the other data in the table. In particular, the relatively small sample size means that the\nfigures may not be representative\n100 Sources: Home Office (updates Fig 9 of Protecting the Public (Cm 3190)); HC Deb 6 February 1996 col 107W\n101 Those aged 21 and over convicted of indictable drug trafficking offences: unlawful production of drugs other than\ncannabis, unlawful supply, possession with intent to supply unlawfully and unlawful import or export.

In 1995, 72% of those sentenced for all drug trafficking offences (regardless of\nnumber of previous convictions) were given immediate custody with an average sentence\nlength of 44 months103.\nIn 1995, 71% of those sentenced for domestic burglary in the Crown Court and 26% of\nthose sentenced in magistrates' courts (49% of offenders sentenced in all courts for the\noffence) were given immediate custodial sentences. The average sentence imposed was 17.2\nmonths in the Crown Court and 3.8 months in magistrates' courts, with an overall average of\n13.8 months.

Additional source: Home Office\n67\n\n\nBetween 1989 and 29 October 1996, the Attorney General referred 303 cases in England and\nWales to the Court of Appeal on the grounds of undue leniency. Of these, 22 were\nsubsequently withdrawn and in six leave was refused. Of the 263 cases considered to date\n(twelve are outstanding), the sentence was increased in 228 (87%), was unchanged in 34 and\nwas reduced in one. \nFull details of the offences involved in these cases are not readily available but, of the 281\ncases referred and not withdrawn, 14 were manslaughter, one soliciting murder, 64 wounding\nor causing grievous bodily harm with intent, 31 rape, 74 robbery (all robberies, not just those\ncovered by the Bill), and three unlawful sexual intercourse (all ages). Five involved\nconspiracy to import or supply drugs and twelve aggravated burglary or burglary with intent\n(not necessarily domestic burglary)105. \nSentencing in the United States\nThe criminal justice system in the United States differs so much from that in this country that\nany comparisons between the two are virtually impossible to make. As considerable interest\nhas been expressed in the USA, this paper presents some of the available data, the latest of\nwhich are for 1992. They cover the sentencing of those convicted of felonies106. Three types\nof sentence - prison confinement (usually for a year or more), jail confinement (usually for\nunder a year) and probation - account for virtually all of the sentences imposed in both State\nand federal courts as punishment for a felony conviction. \nIn 1992 there were 935,303 convictions of felons in the United States. 70% of all convicted\nfelons were sentenced to custody but the proportion varied by type of offence. For violent\noffences (murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault) etc, 81% of those convicted went to\nprison or jail. Within this category, 97% of those convicted of murder or manslaughter, 72%\nconvicted of aggravated assault107, 87% of those convicted of rape and 88% of those convicted\nof robbery were given a custodial sentence108. For drug trafficking the figure was 76%, for\nweapons offences 69%, and for property offences (burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft,\nforgery, fraud and embezzlement) 66%. For burglary alone, 75% of felons were given a\ncustodial sentence.\nAverage sentence lengths in 1992 were as follows: murder/manslaughter 19.8 years; rape\n10.8 years; robbery 8.4 years; aggravated assault 4.7 years; drug trafficking 4.5 years; drug\npossession 2.7 years; burglary 4.7 years. The average time served is about half of the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n105 Source: Attorney General's Chambers\n106 States vary in their definitions of a felony but, in general, a felony is a crime that has the potential of being\npunished by more than a year in prison\n107 Intentionally and without legal justification causing serious bodily injury, with or without a deadly weapon or using\na deadly or dangerous weapon to threaten, attempt, or cause bodily injury, regardless of the degree of injury if any.\nIncludes attempted murder, aggravated battery, felonious assault and assault with a deadly weapon\n108 Death sentences are included with prison sentences\n68\n\n\nsentence imposed in most cases109. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n109 Data from Felony Sentences in the United States 1992 (Bureau of Justice Statistics May 1996)\n69\n\n\nPl\nea\nse\n c\nut\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nR\ne\nse\na\nr\nc\nh \nP\na\npe\nr \n96\n/9\n9\nSe\nct\nio\nn\n C\no\nde\n: \nH\nA\nS\nT\nitl\ne:\n \nT\nhe\n \nC\nr\nim\ne\n \n(S\ne\nn\nte\nn\nc\ne\ns) \nBi\nll \n[B\nill\n 3\n \no\nf \n19\n96\n/9\n7]\nIt \nw\no\nu\nld\n g\nre\nat\nly\n h\nel\np \nto\n e\nns\nur\ne \nth\nat\n R\nes\nea\nrc\nh \nPa\npe\nrs\n f\nul\nfil\n t\nhe\nir \npu\nrp\nos\ne \nif \nM\nem\nbe\nrs\n (o\nr t\nhe\nir \nsta\nff)\n w\no\nu\nld\n f\nill\n i\nn \nan\nd \nre\ntu\nrn\n t\nhi\ns \nbr\nie\nf\npr\ne-\nad\ndr\nes\nse\nd \nqu\nes\ntio\nnn\nai\nre\n. \nN\neg\nat\niv\ne \nre\nsp\non\nse\ns \nca\nn \nbe\n a\ns \nus\nef\nul\n a\ns \npo\nsit\niv\ne.\nFo\nr \nyo\nur\n p\nur\npo\nse\ns, \ndi\nd \nyo\nu \nfin\nd \nth\nis \npa\npe\nr:\nV\ner\ny \nu\nse\nfu\nl\nQu\nite\n \nu\nse\nfu\nl\nN\not\n m\nuc\nh \nus\ne\n1.1.\n \n \n \nTo\no \nlo\nng\nTh\ne \nri\ngh\nt l\nen\ngt\nh\nTo\no \nsh\nor\nt\n2.2.\n \n \n \nC\nlea\nr\nN\not\n a\nlw\nay\ns \ncl\nea\nr\nR\nat\nhe\nr \nu\nn\ncl\nea\nr\n3.3.\n \n \n \nA\nn\ny \nc\no\nm\nm\ne\nn\nts\n? \nN\na\nm\ne\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n \nM\nP\n/A\nss\nis\nta\nn\nt \nto\n \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n(P\nle\nas\ne \npr\nin\nt)\n\n\nPlease fold\nINTERNAL\nMiss Nicola Harland\nHouse of Commons\nDepartment of the Library\n1 Derby Gate\nLondon SW1A 2DG\nPlease fold\n\n\nRecent Research Papers on related subjects include:\n \n96/100 The Crime (Sentences) Bill and the Crime and 31.10.96\nPunishment (Scotland) Bill: provisions for mentally\ndisordered offenders\n96/15 Controls on Knives and other Offensive Weapons 25.01.96\n95/29 Investigating and reviewing possible miscarriages of 03.03.95\njustice - The Criminal Appeal Bill [Bill 57 of 1994/95] \n95/16 Proceeds of Crime Bill 1995/95 [Bill 10] 02.02.95\n \n\n\nCriminal Justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In\nthe three months ended August 1996, the main growth in exports (in value terms) has come from exports\nto EU, with the largest rise being in exports to Germany. This was partially offset by a fall in exports\nto Belgium. Outside the EU, rises in exports to Oil Exporting Countries and the Rest of the World\ncontrasted with falls in exports to other Western Europe, North America and Other OECD Countries.\nIn value terms the main growth in imports has come from North America and Germany. In 1995 the\nenlarged European Union (EU 15) received 58.3% of UK exports and supplied 56.6% of all UK imports.\n* Volume of Trade  (excluding oil and erratics) - In the three months to August 1996, the volume of\nexports and imports both rose 2 per cent compared with the previous three months. Latest estimates of\ntrends show both export and import volumes rising slightly. \n  \n* Trade in oil - The surplus on trade in oil in the three months ended August 1996 was £1.2 billion\ncompared with £1.1 billion in the previous three months. \n* Non-EC countries - The non-EU visible trade deficit in September was provisionally estimated at\n£0.9 billion. Provisional estimates of value (excluding oil and erratics) show exports fell by 1½ per cent\nto £5.9 bn. while imports rose 2½ per cent to £6.8 bn.

In 1995 GDFCF was still 11% lower than the peak in 1989. \n* In the second quarter of 1996, total GDFCF rose by 2.9% compared to the previous quarter. Virtually all of the\nincrease was due to greater fixed investment in vehicles, ships & aircraft (up 44%); the increase in investment in\nthese assets was partly offset by falls in the major components of GDFCF: plant & machinery and other new\nbuildings and works, which fell 2% and 0.2% respectively.

This is known as \"direct selling\". These direct selling schemes\nare variously described as pyramid selling, multi-level marketing, or network marketing; they\nare collectively referred to as 'trading schemes' throughout this paper. \nThe Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has described trading schemes as a way of\nselling goods or services through a scheme which operates on more than one level1. People\nwho join such a scheme (called \"participants\") buy goods or services from the person or\ncompany running the scheme (called \"promoters\") or from other participants and then sell\nthem to the general public usually in their homes. Apart from the profit they make on selling,\nparticipants may also be offered other rewards which they can earn in several ways. These\nmay include bonuses for recruiting new participants and commission on sales made by other\nparticipants.\n \nAs new participants are themselves encouraged to recruit new members, (as well as selling\nto consumers), a widening network of sellers is created, with the company at the apex of this\npyramid, and the newest recruits at the base. The Government has estimated that annual sales\nfrom trading schemes are around £200 million.2\nTrading schemes are legitimate commercial practices provided that they comply with Part XI\nof the Fair Trading Act 1973, The Pyramid Selling Schemes Regulations 1989 and the\nPyramid Selling Schemes (Amendment) Regulations 1990.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 DTI, Pyramid Selling And Similar Trading Schemes: a consultation document, March 1995\n2 Ibid\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nII Regulation of trading schemes\nA. Background \nThe underlying problem with some trading schemes is that they can be used by unscrupulous\npromoters to make money at the expense of participants in the scheme, rather than by the\nlegitimate method of selling goods or services to consumers.\nThis type of unfair scheme became prevalent in the late 1960s. The abuses current at that time\nincluded:\n• a demand that participants pay for the right to participate in the scheme, coupled with\nthe promise of bonuses when participants recruited other people into the scheme;\n•  the absence of any written contract setting out a participant's rights;\n• the absence of any cooling-off period for new recruits or any right for participants to\nclaim refunds for unsold goods on withdrawal from the scheme;\n• inadequate or misleading information about the nature of the scheme and the rewards\navailable to participants.3\nThe law offered sanctions, both civil and criminal, if a scheme was fraudulent but these\nsanctions took considerable time to take effect. \nControls over pyramid selling and similar trading schemes were first introduced in 1973, as\npart of the Fair Trading Act 1973 ['the Act']; specifically, Part XI of the Act which came into\nforce on 15 November 1973 and the Pyramid Selling Regulations 19734 ['the 1973\nRegulations], made under Section 119 of the Act.\nThe main aim of Part XI of the Act and the 1973 Regulations was to ban the taking of certain\ntypes of payment by scheme promoters, in particular:\n• participation fees paid on the promise of bonuses for recruiting new participants;\n• payments for training;\n• non-returnable deposits;\n• payments of more than £25 for goods during the first seven days of participation in\na scheme. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 DTI, Review of Legislation on Pyramid Selling: a consultation document, December 1986\n4 SI No. 1740\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nThe 1973 Regulations laid down strict and detailed requirements as to the information which\ncould be given in advertisements and circulars inviting people to join a scheme. Most\nimportantly, the Regulations required that all participants should be given a written agreement\non joining, which included rights to refunds for returnable goods on withdrawal from a\nscheme.\nHowever, as both pyramid and direct selling schemes became more widespread, so did\ncomplaints about their exploitation of participants. In 1986, the DTI decided to review the\nlegislation, and in December of that year published a consultation document entitled, \"Review\nof Legislation on Pyramid Selling\". This document outlined proposals to introduce new\nprimary legislation to amend Part XI of the Act, aimed at restricting more effectively the\namount of money that promoters could obtain from participants in pyramid selling schemes.\nThe proposed legislation \"would ban the soliciting or taking of payments for stocks or goods\nunless these are required for display or demonstration purposes or to satisfy orders which\nparticipants have previously received from consumers. The taking of payments such as joining\nand renewal fees, payment for training and deposits for future purchases of goods would\ncontinue to be banned as at present.\"5 Interested parties were invited to comment on the\nproposals and to provide estimates of the costs and benefits to the industry if the proposals\nwere put into effect.\nThough comments received on the review indicated a broad measure of support, there was\ncriticism of the methods proposed. It was argued that to introduce rigorous controls on stock\nlevels by requiring written evidence of orders previously received would place costly and\nunjustified new burdens on bona fide multi-level selling operations. The DTI accepted this\nargument, and revised proposals were published on 29 April 1988.6\nThe Pyramid Selling Schemes Regulations 1989 (SI No.2195) came into operation on 1 March\n1990. The Pyramid Selling Schemes (Amendment) Regulations 1990 (SI No.150) corrected\ncertain errors in the earlier Statutory Instrument and came into force on the same day. The\naim of these Regulations was to strengthen the existing law by ensuring that would-be\nparticipants in multi-level marketing schemes are fully informed about the risks involved\nbefore they sign up to join a scheme and order goods. The Regulations also removed the more\ndetailed rules governing advertisements and circulars, thereby making it easier for the DTI\nto enforce the Regulations.\nMr Eric Forth, MP, then Consumer Affairs Minister, explained the new Regulations in a\nwritten answer to a PQ asked by Mr Oppenheim, MP: \n\"The new Regulations are designed to ensure that no one will be able to participate in a pyramid\nselling, or multi-level marketing scheme, without having first signed a contract which sets out their\nrights and includes a statutory warning about such schemes.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 DTI press notice, Review of legislation of pyramid selling, 17 December 1986\n6 DTI letter, Pyramid Selling/Multi-level Marketing, House of Commons deposited paper NS 3914, 29 April\n1988\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nThe promoters of the scheme will be required to set out in the contract details of when the scheme\nstarted in the United Kingdom and where it is operated from as well as descriptions of the goods or\nservices on offer. They will also have to specify in the contract that the participant may withdraw from\nthe scheme without penalty within 14 days of first signing and set out the participant's rights should\nhe subsequently wish to withdraw.\nThe Regulations also prohibit promoters from accepting more than £75 from participants within the first\nseven days. They set an upper limit of £30 as payment for participants recruiting others. There are also\nprovisions relating to payments for training facilities and deposits.\nIn making these Regulations I have focused on enabling a prospective participant to make an informed\nchoice when considering whether to join the scheme.\nThese Regulations do not cover the content of advertisements, notices, prospectuses and circulars which\ndo not state the financial benefits of joining a scheme, or which may appear in the press or as\nhandouts. These remain, quite properly, subject to the Advertising Standards Authority's code of\npractice.\"7\n      \nB. The Current legislation\nAt present, the controls embodied in Part XI of the Fair Trading Act 1973 apply only to\ntrading schemes that have certain features specified in the Act. Specifically, section 118(1)\n& (2) of the Act states:\n\"118.-(1) This Part of this Act applies to any trading scheme which includes the following\nelements, that is to say-\n(a) goods or services, or both, are to be provided by the person promoting the scheme (in this Part\nof this Act referred to as \"the promoter\") or, in the case of a scheme promoted by two or more\npersons acting in concert (in this Part of the Act referred to as \"the promoters\"), are to be provided\nby one or more of those persons;\n(b) the goods or services so provided are to be supplied to or for other persons under transactions\neffected by persons (other than the promoter or any of the promoters) who participate in the\nscheme (each of whom is in this Part of this Act referred to as a participant\");\n(c) those transactions, or most of them, are to be effected elsewhere than at premises at which the\npromoter or any of the promoters or the participant effecting the transaction carries on business;\nand\n(d) the prospect is held out to participants of receiving payments or other benefits in respect of any\none or more of the matters specified in the next following subsection.\n(2) The matters referred to in paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of this section are-\n(a) the introduction of other persons who become participants;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n7 HC Deb 30 November 1989 cc348-349W\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\n(b) the promotion, transfer or other change of status of participants within the trading scheme;\n(c) the supply of goods to other participants;\n(d) the supply of training facilities or other services for other participants;\n(e) transactions effected by other participants under which goods are to be supplied to , or services\nare to be supplied for, other persons.\"\nOnly those trading schemes with all the above characteristics are subject to the Act's controls.\nIf a trading scheme is caught by the legislation, then it is controlled under the Act by a\ncombination of the deterrent of criminal offences and the application of Regulations.\n1. Criminal Offences\nUnder section 120 of Part XI of the Act, a promoter of a trading scheme has to be wary of\ncommitting four criminal offences. Two are 'recruitment offences' and entail:\n• receiving payment from a participant or potential participant who was persuaded by\nthe prospect of benefits from introducing others to the scheme; or\n• using the prospect of benefits from introducing others to the scheme to try to persuade\nsomeone to make a payment.\nThe recruitment offences focus on the use of persuasion whether by the promoter or\nparticipant. These offences are effective controls in so far as they apply as soon as recruitment\nstarts and continue as long as payments are taken or sought.\nThe other two offences are for breaches of the Regulations relating to promotional material\nand contracts between promoters and participants. The maximum penalty on summary\nconviction is a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum (currently £5,000) and/or three\nmonths imprisonment. Offences may also be tried on indictment.\nThe DTI is the enforcement authority for Part XI of the Act. Trading Standards Departments\nrefer cases to the DTI. At present, a prosecution must be brought within 12 months of\ndiscovery of the offence. \n2. Regulations\nAs mentioned above, the relevant Regulations are the Pyramid Selling Schemes Regulations\n1989 as amended by the Pyramid Selling Schemes (Amendment) Regulations 1990. However,\ncontracts between promoters and participants made before 1 March 1990 are covered by\nRegulations 5 and 6 and paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Regulation 10 of the 1973 Regulations.\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nAll controlled trading schemes must comply with the Regulations. They regulate the written\nagreement between the promoter and participants, the form of documents used, and\npromotional material. A brief summary of some of the principal regulations are set out below:\nThe written agreement\nThe current Regulations require there to be a written agreement, signed by both the participant\nand the promoter, before the promoter accepts any payment or undertaking to make a payment\nfrom a potential participant. Participation in a scheme cannot start before this agreement is\nin place and the participant has been given a copy of the signed agreement. \nUnder the present Regulations, the written agreement must include the following information:\n• the commencement date of the scheme in the UK;\n• the identity and address of the promoter;\n• the goods or services supplied through the scheme;\n• the role of participants;\n• the rights of participants in connection with termination of the contract; and\n• a statutory warning.\nIn addition, the present Regulations require that the written contract includes a provision that\nif the promoter terminates the contract then he will buy back any goods sold to that\nparticipant with the promoter having to bear the expense of delivery. The buy back price must\nbe that paid unless the participant has damaged the goods, in which case the amount due is\nproportionate to the reduction in the value of the goods. \nThey also stipulate that the contract between a promoter and a participant must include a\nprovision that a participant terminating the contract has the right to require the promoter to\nbuy back any goods returned in original condition at a price that is not less than 90 per cent\nof the price paid. \nA contract between a promoter and a participant must also include a provision that the\nparticipant has the right to terminate without penalty by giving 14 days written notice of\ntermination to the promoter. \nThe Regulations also require the contract between a promoter and a participant to include\nprovisions that give additional rights to new participants who wish to cancel the contract.\nThey must have a cooling off period: during the 14 days after signing the contract, the\nparticipant must have a right to require the promoter to repay any money paid in connection\nwith participation in the scheme. This right to repayment covers both joining fees and\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\npayments for any goods returned to the promoter (subject to a deduction only in so far as the\nparticipant is responsible for any deterioration in the condition of the goods).\nThe present Regulations prohibit a promoter from accepting any payment from a new\nparticipant that exceeds a £75 limit. \nFinally, promoters and participants are prohibited from taking security for goods.\nPromotional Material\nThe issue, circulation or distribution of documents which are advertisements, prospectuses,\ncirculars and notices for controlled schemes are regulated if they contain either an invitation\nto join or any information intended to result in someone joining a controlled scheme. \n \nExemptions\nUnder the Fair Trading Act 1973, two types of trading schemes are exempt from all the\nrequirements of the Regulations:\n(i) schemes with only one UK participant; and\n(ii) schemes where the financial benefits are no more than £30 in respect of the introduction\nof other participants.\nThe first exemption means that the Regulations do not apply to those franchise schemes that\nonly have one UK operator. The second exemption excludes 'single level' trading schemes in\nwhich participants mainly make sales direct to the public. In single level schemes, participants\nmay also recruit others but do not benefit from their recruits' activities. This second exemption\ndoes not mean that no offence is committed provided the payment for each introduction is\nunder £30: the offence relates to the total benefits that might result from recruitment of others\n(ie they must not exceed £30 in total).\nAll other trading schemes caught by the Act are subject to all the requirements of the\nRegulations.\n       \n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nIII Review of current legislation\nThe Government recognises that the principle underlying trading schemes is open to abuse.\nThis is likely if participants' earnings mostly derive from the recruitment of other participants.\nThere is also scope for abuse if participants' earnings come from sales either to other\nparticipants or by other participants. \nA general criticism of the Fair Trading Act 1973 is that it is no longer adequate to control\nthe different types of trading schemes now operating in the UK. The Act's controls apply to\nschemes that have certain features specified in the Act that were typical of pyramid selling\ntwenty years ago. Since then there has been a proliferation of schemes that do not have all\nthe features specified in section 118 of the Act. Consequently, these schemes avoid,\nsometimes deliberately, being subject to the controls embodied in Part XI of the Act. As a\nresult, there is the anomaly that only some trading schemes are subject to the Act's controls.\nIn June 1993 the DTI announced that it was reviewing the existing rules covering pyramid\nselling;8 although this was an informal review which did not then lead to any proposals being\ndrawn up.\nHowever, in an exchange in the House of Lords in November 1994, it was confirmed that\nconsultation over reforming the legislation would occur in the relatively near future.9 \nA consultation document, entitled Pyramid Selling and Similar Trading Schemes, was finally\npublished by the DTI on 16 March 1995 as part of the Government's Deregulation Initiative.\nThis document proposed amending Part XI of the Act and replacing the Pyramid Selling\nSchemes Regulations 1989 and the Pyramid Selling Schemes (Amendment) Regulations 1990\nwith new Trading Schemes Regulations. The main effect would be to widen the scope of the\ncontrols and increase the effectiveness of the protection for participants while reducing the\ncompliance costs for promoters.\nAnnouncing this consultation document Earl Ferrers, Minister for Consumer Affairs, said:\n\"I have published a consultation document to seek views on proposals for\nchanges to the Fair Trading Act 1973. Since it was introduced over 20 years\nago, there has been a proliferation of pyramid selling schemes which are\noutside the Act's controls. At present, there is little protection for those who\njoin these schemes. We are proposing to up-date the Act and to overhaul the\nRegulations which cover pyramid selling.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 HC Deb 10 June 1993 c.299W\n9 HL Deb 23 November 1994 c.271\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nThere are a number of entirely legitimate schemes which provide thousands of\nindividuals with opportunities to become entrepreneurs. These businesses are\nbeing harmed by the practices of a few rogue operators.\nUnscrupulous promoters appear to devise schemes deliberately to avoid being\nsubject to the Fair Trading Act's controls. Some schemes appear to be\nfraudulent but, under the present law, it is often difficult to prosecute the\npromoters until the pattern of trading has been established over a period. The\nresult is that unsuspecting people, who have joined such schemes, have lost\nconsiderable sums of money.\nFor example, some schemes advertise opportunities for members to become\n'financially independent' through getting money by recruiting new members.\nThe vast majority of those who join, sometimes more than 80 per cent, lose all\nthe money which they pay into the scheme. This is because these schemes are\nconstructed on a pyramid basis, with the redistribution of the monthly\nsubscriptions of most members being passed up through a number of levels to\nthe much smaller numbers who joined earlier. These schemes collapse when\nno new investor can be found to join. Examination then usually reveals that\nmuch of the income has found its way to the original promoters.\nThe Government proposes to remove loopholes in the Fair Trading Act and to\noverhaul the Regulations for trading schemes. The proposals are designed to\nprotect not only those who might consider joining any sort of trading scheme\nbut also those who already belong to any such scheme.\nWe are not only seeking views from organisations who represent business and\nconsumers, but we also want to hear from members of the public, particularly\nthose who belong to trading schemes. For the first time, we are issuing a\nComments Booklet which will make it easier for the public to understand the\ncomplex issues and to make their views known.\"10\nThis consultation period ended on 31 May 1995. \nThe most important proposed amendment to the Fair Trading Act contained in the\nconsultation document would make all trading schemes whose participants recruit others\nsubject to the Act's controls. These controls make some practices unlawful and regulate the\npromotion and operation of schemes. Other proposed amendments would:\n• make it a new criminal offence to operate or to promote a \"money circulation\nscheme\", that is a scheme in which payments to any participant derive from payments\nmade by other participants;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n10 DTI press notice, Overhaul Of Pyramid Selling Legislation Proposed, 16 March 1995 \n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\n• give Trading Standards Officers enforcement powers and lengthen the period for\nbringing a prosecution from 12 months to three years; \n• exempt from the Regulations those trading schemes whose participants' earnings come\nonly from their own sales and their own recruitment; all trading schemes would be\nsubject to the Regulations controlling promotional material directed at potential\nparticipants.\n• ensure that before someone participates in a scheme and before the promoter accepts\nany payment or undertaking to make a payment from a potential participant, the\npromoter and participant have signed a written agreement which contains all the terms\nrelating to his participation and which complies with the Regulation that specifies\ncontract terms.\nThe consultation document specified a number of new contractual terms which it suggested\nshould be incorporated into any written contract between a promoter and a participant. In\nparticular, it suggested that every participant must have a contract with the promoter that\nspecifies:\n• the name and address of the promoter;\n• a description of what is sold through the scheme;\n• the role of the scheme's participants;\n• details of how to cancel the contract and how to recover any money already paid;\n•  details of how to terminate the contract; and \n• a statutory warning with useful information.\nThe consultation document suggested that it should be a term of the written agreement that\nif a promoter terminates a contract with a participant, the participant can require the promoter\nto buy back goods, returned at the promoter's expense, at the tax-inclusive price originally\npaid (adjusted if goods have deteriorated through the fault of the participant). Similarly,\nparticipants should be able to terminate without penalty on giving written notice to the\npromoter. \nThe consultation document also suggested that there should be an invoice for any sale to a\nparticipant for which an order form has not been completed. All order forms and invoices\nmust include a statutory warning against buying excessive stock.\nIt is also proposed changing the cooling-off periods in which a new participant could cancel\nhis contract with the promoter and reclaim any joining fee to either 7, 14 or 30 days. For\nrecovering payments on returned goods, the consultation document suggested that the cooling-\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\noff period could be changed to either 14, 30 or even 90 days. [Under current legislation, the\ncooling-off period is 14 days for all payments by new participants and thereafter, on\nterminating a contract, a right to a 90% refund on returned goods].\nOther proposals made in this consultation document include the proposal that participants\nhave a free choice whether or not to purchase any good or service through the scheme.\nOthers concerned regulating publicity material used by trading schemes. The document\nsuggested that regulations should apply to any form  of publicity material directed at potential\nparticipants except that which:\n• does not indicate the financial benefits from participation in the scheme; or\n• is subject to the British code of Advertising Practice.\nFurthermore, publicity material containing an invitation to join a trading scheme should\ninclude:\n• the name and address of the promoter;\n• a description of the goods or services supplied through the scheme ; and\n• a statutory warning.\nHowever, the consultation document proposed that any other publicity material directed at\npotential participants should only include:\n• the name of the promoter; and\n• a description of the goods or services supplied through the scheme.\nFinally, anyone making a claim about potential financial benefits from participation in any\npublicity material directed at potential participants would have to be able to substantiate the\nclaim.\n  \n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nIV The Trading Schemes Bill [Bill 22 of 1995/96] \nSir Nicholas Scott's Private Member's Bill on trading schemes was introduced in the House\nof Commons on 13 December 1995. It is to have its Second Reading on 2 February 1996. \nThe Bill amends the scope of the definition of trading schemes under Part XI of the Fair\nTrading Act 1973 to apply controls to a wider range of schemes. The purpose is to protect\nvulnerable people from financial loss by ensuring that all trading schemes whose members\nrecruit others, (excepting only those subject to control under the Financial Services Act 1986),\nare subject to the controls under Part XI of the Fair Trading Act 1973. \nIn describing this Bill, Sir Nicholas Scott has said:\n\"My Bill is designed to close a loophole in the law through which the\npromoters of a wide range of 'get rich quick' schemes have managed to avoid\nprosecution. It is estimated that over the past two years investors, in particular\nthose looking for a good way to invest their redundancy payments, have lost\nover £30 million.\nThe most worrying schemes are strikingly similar to the widely reported\npyramid selling scams in Romania and Russia, whereby participants are\npersuaded to make regular payments to the promoter and to encourage others\nto do the same. They do so with the promise that they will, after a period of\ntime, receive a huge return not only on their own investment but also on the\ninvestments made by others they have introduced to the scheme. To gain\ncredibility some of the promoters have made payments to a few of the original\nparticipants, but usually within a year many of the promoters have absconded\nor managed to transfer the accumulated funds to off-shore bank accounts.\nThis type of scheme appears to be devised to escape the controls of the Fair\nTrading Act and the Financial Services Act. The most effective solution is to\nwiden the scope of the controls over pyramid selling and similar trading\nschemes in Part XI of the Fair Trading Act. These controls outlaw recruitment\nbased on the promise of rewards for recruiting others.\nThe purpose of my Bill is to up-date Part XI of the Fair Trading Act so that\nit applies to all trading schemes whose members recruit others. It is not my\nintention to impose bureaucratic restraint on the direct selling industry. The\nlegitimate direct selling industry, which meets the requirements of the Fair\nTrading Act's controls, now accounts for £1 billion of the retail trade sector\nand offers very useful part-time employment to thousands of would-be\nentrepreneurs. The industry deserves encouragement and its sales force deserve\nthe protection of the law. With the growing number of people seeking ways\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nof supplementing the family income, I want to make sure that this protection\ncovers all those who wish to take up any such opportunity\".11\nAs mentioned above [on page 8], section 118 of the Fair Trading Act 1973 defines the trading\nschemes to which Part XI of the Fair Trading Act 1973 applies. Sir Nicholas Scott's Bill\nintroduces two new clauses. Clause 1 proposes to substitute section 118 with a new clause\ndesigned to widen the definition of trading schemes caught by the Act. Specifically, clause\n1 of his Bill states:\n\"1. For section 118 of the Fair Trading Act 1973 (trading schemes to which Part XI applies) there\nis substituted -\n118.- (1) This Part of this Act applies to any trading scheme if -\n(a) the prospect is held out to participants of receiving payments or other benefits in respect of any\nof the matters specified in subsection 2 of this section; and\n(b) (subject to subsection (7) of this section) either or both of the conditions in subsection (3) and\n(4) of this section are fulfilled in relation to the scheme.\n(2) The matters referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section are -\n(a) the introduction by any person of other persons who become participants in a trading scheme;\n(b) the continued participation of participants in a trading scheme;\n(c) the promotion, transfer or other change of status of participants within a trading scheme;\n(d) the supply of goods or services by any person to or for other persons;\n(e) the acquisition of goods or services by any person.\n(3) The condition in this subsection is that -\n(a) goods or services, or both, are to be provided by the person promoting the scheme (in this Part\nof this Act referred to as 'the promoter') or, in the case of a scheme promoted by two or more\npersons acting in concert (in this Part of this Act referred to as 'the promoters'), by one or more\nof those persons; and\n(b) the goods or services so provided -\n(i) are to be supplied to or for other persons under transactions effected by participants (whether\nin the capacity of agents of the promoter or of one of the promoters or in any other capacity), or\n(ii) are to be used for the purposes of the supply of goods or services to or for other persons under\nsuch transactions.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n11 Trading Schemes Bill [Bill 22 of 1995/96], explanatory note from Sir Nicholas Scott's office, January 1996\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\n(4) The condition in this subsection is that goods or services, or both, are to be supplied by the\npromoter or any of the promoters to or for persons introduced to him or any of the other promoters\n(or an employee or agent of his or theirs) by participants.\"\nUnder clause 1 of this Bill, for Part XI to apply to a trading scheme, the scheme must meet\ntwo criteria: first, participants must expect to benefit from their participation in the scheme\nin respect of any of the specified matters; and second, goods or services either have to be\nprovided by the promoter to the participants for them to supply to someone else (or to use for\nthe purposes of such a supply) or have to be supplied by the promoter to third parties\nintroduced to him by participants. [However, this second criterion may be disapplied by an\norder made by the Secretary of State].\nClause 2 of the Bill extends the scope of the regulation-making power in section 119(1) of\nthe Act to include any form of advertisement, prospectus, circular or notice directed at\npotential participants in a trading scheme to which Part XI of that Act applies. In effect,\nclause 2 is a positive response to developments in marketing; it extends the existing\nRegulations on promotional material to cover non-documentary forms, such as videos. \n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nV The Government's View\nOn 19 December 1995, the Consumer Affairs Minister, Mr John Taylor, welcomed Sir\nNicholas Scott's Bill. He said:\n\"The legislation governing pyramid and similar trading schemes is over twenty years\nold. These controls provide essential protection to members of such schemes. While\nmany trading schemes provide legitimate opportunities for thousands of individuals to\nbecome entrepreneurs, there has been a proliferation of schemes outside the controls.\nBecause of the risks to members of such schemes the Government published a\nconsultation document earlier this year.\nSir Nicholas Scott's Bill, which would implement the main proposal of the\nGovernment's consultation document would bring protection to thousands of small\nentrepreneurs. It will aim to widen existing controls making them apply to all trading\nschemes whose members recruit others.\"12\nThe Government acknowledged that the Fair Trading Act 1973 controls do not apply to all\ntrading schemes but only to those who had characteristics typical of schemes 20 years ago.\nIn particular, they do not apply to schemes where essentially all that is sold is membership\nof the scheme. The Government has stated its support of this Bill because it is intended to\nclose this loophole.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12 DTI press notice, Trading Schemes - A New Bill, 19 December 1995\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nVI Other calls for reform\nIn 1994 the DTI received a number of representations calling for reform, in particular from\nAmway UK Ltd, which is a particularly successful network marketing company. It has\nlobbied for some time that the existing controls are insufficient to protect those who join\nnetwork marketing schemes. Quite recently the company published a leaflet listing its\nproposals which it issued to many of its members.13 Amway's principal concern is that\n\"pyramid selling\" has come to be thought of as a purely criminal activity, even though the\nGovernment regards the title as interchangeable with others.14 Amway proposed that \"pyramid\nselling\" only be used to refer to individuals breaking the law; and that \"direct selling\" become\nthe correct term to describe this type of business. The company's other major\nrecommendations, as set out in its leaflet, were:\n• Protection for participants in direct selling schemes should be extended to all travelling\nsalesmen who sell their company's products away from company premises, and whose\nsalary is part determined by a commission on sales.\n[It is not quite clear in Amway's leaflet quite what they mean by this, given that many aspects\nof the relationship between a promoter and a participant are unique to direct marketing, and\ndo not bear direct comparison to the relationship between a company and its sales force.]\n• Participants should have the right to return any goods, and get a full refund, for\nwhatever reason, within ninety days of joining a direct selling scheme.\n• Promoters should be banned from demanding payment solely for registration rights,\nif this is not connected with the supply of goods or services.\n• Trading Standards Officers should be made responsible for enforcing the legislation,\nrather than the Secretary of State.\n• At present, promoters cannot accept more than £75 from any participant within seven\ndays of the participant joining the scheme. The seven day limit is insufficient and, as\nan alternative control, promoters should be banned from selling stock to a participant\nif it comes to over 70% of that participant's guaranteed orders.\nIn April 1994, whilst the Government conceded that it needed to review the existing rules\ncovering pyramid selling and other similar trading schemes, it stated that it did not consider\nall the recommendations made by Amway UK Ltd to be appropriate.15\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n13\n\"Now What Was That I Had To Do Again?\", Amway UK Ltd, 1994\n14 HC Deb 14 July 1992 c.664W\n15 HC Deb 27 April 1994 c.167W\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nThis eventually led to the DTI's consultation document published on 16 March 1995 to seek\nviews on updating the Fair Trading Act 1973 and overhauling the regulations which cover\npyramid selling and similar trading schemes.16\nOne other recent development in this area has been the action taken by the DTI to move\nagainst schemes where promises of rewards for recruiting others are the main method of\noperation. Several companies operating such schemes have recently been wound-up by the\nCourts. These included Alchemy UK plc, 3T Publications Ltd (trading as FPW), and Global\nPioneers Ltd.17 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n16 DTI, Pyramid Selling and Similar Trading Schemes: a consultation document, March 1995\n17 DTI press notice, Trading Schemes - A New Bill, 19 December 1995\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/20\nVII Further Reading:\n1.

          "The Value of the Pound since 1750\nResearch Paper 96/18\n1 February 1996\nThe Library is often asked about how the purchasing power of the pound has changed over\nvarious periods. This is frequently in order to estimate the current value of monetary amounts\nfrom past years. This Research Paper attempts to provide a long-term perspective by\npresenting a price index for the period 1750 to 1995 based on a range of official and\nunofficial sources. The results suggest that, over this period, prices have risen by nearly 110\ntimes with a rise in excess of 55 fold since 1914. This Paper replaces Research Paper No\n94/64.\nRobert Twigger\nEconomic Policy & Statistics Section\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff. Authors are available to discuss the contents of these papers with Members\nand their staff but cannot advise members of the general public.\n\n\nCONTENTS\nPage\nI Introduction 5\nII The Sources 6\nIII The Results 7\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/18\nI Introduction\nInflation - the increase in the general level of prices over a specified period - results in an\nerosion of the internal value of a currency. Thus, for example, if prices double, a given\nnominal amount of currency will buy half the goods and services it did previously. On the\nother hand, although less common since the Second World War, a period of falling prices\nresults in an increase in purchasing power. This paper presents a price index covering the\nperiod 1750 to 1995 to illustrate the way in which the purchasing power of the pound has\nchanged over the long-term. No attempt is made to measure changes in the external value\nof the currency as a result of movements in exchange rates but changes in the prices of\nimported goods are reflected in the price index.\nIt must be stressed that, for a number of reasons, such an exercise is very approximate.\nExpenditure patterns have changed dramatically over the past 250 years. While many\nproducts now commonly purchased (cars, electrical appliances, processed foods, etc) simply\ndid not exist in 1750, goods which consumed a large share of household budgets in the\nEighteenth Century - candles for instance - are now an insignificant part of most families'\nexpenditure. It is, however, possible to compare price levels over the long-term by linking\nprice indices covering relatively short periods into a single series. Even so, indices covering\nonly a few years can become unrepresentative if they are not adjusted to reflect changes in\nexpenditure patterns. A further problem with long-term comparisons involves changes in the\nquality of goods. For example, while it is possible to compare the price of a Mini today with\nthat in 1959, it is much more difficult to identify the degree to which the increase in price\nreflects the improved specification of the car.\nIn addition, the further one looks back into history, the more difficult it is to obtain reliable\ninformation. The first official price index - the pre-War Cost of Living Index which\nreflected changes in the cost of providing a standard of living prevalent in working class\nhouseholds - started in 1914. There are also periods for which a number of alternative indices\nare available each of which suggest slightly different trends in price levels. Therefore,\nalthough the results in this Paper are presented in unrounded form to facilitate computation\nand presentation, they are not necessarily accurate to the degree suggested.\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/18\nII The Sources\nThere are two main sources of information on changes in the level of prices faced by\nconsumers. The more familiar is consumer price indices such as the Retail Prices Index.\nAlternatively, a measure can be derived from national accounts statistics. In the national\naccounts, estimates of consumers' expenditure are produced at both cash and constant prices\nand the difference between the two series implies a price deflator for consumers'\nexpenditure.\nThe price series presented in this Paper is derived from the following sources which are listed\nin reverse chronological order:\n1974 to 1995\n• the all-items Retail Prices Index as published by the Central\nStatistical Office. Annual data are the average of monthly\nfigures1.\n1948 to 1974\n• the implied deflator for consumers' expenditure derived from the\nofficial national accounts of the United Kingdom2.\n1870 to 1948\n• the implied deflator for consumers' expenditure derived from the\nunofficial national accounts of the United Kingdom produced by\nthe Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge\nUniversity3.\n                                              \n     \n1 Source: CSO database series CHAW, CBAB\n     \n2 Source: CSO database series AIIK, CCBH\n     \n3 Source: C H Feinstein, National Income, Expenditure and Output of the United\nKingdom 1855 to 1965, 1972, tables 3 and 5\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/18\n1850 to 1870\n• a retail price index constructed by Sir Walter Layton and\nGeoffrey Crowther covering the period 1850 to 19334.\n1750 to 1850\n• an index of consumables' prices constructed by E H Phelps-\nBrown and Sheila Hopkins covering the period 1264 to 19545. \nAn alternative long-term price index (covering the period 1914 to date excluding the years\n1939 to 1945 inclusive) based solely on official sources is published by the Central Statistical\nOffice in its monthly business monitor on the Retail Prices Index6.\nIII The Results\nTable 1 (pages 9-14) shows for each year the level of the price index with 1974 equal to 100\nand the value of the pound relative to a base of 100 pence in 1974. 1974 was chosen as the\nbase year largely on the pragmatic grounds that, as well as being one of the link years in the\nseries, its use prevents the data at the start and the end of the period being inconveniently\nlarge or small. The table also shows the change in prices (the inflation rate) each year.\nOver the period as a whole, prices have risen by around 100 times. Thus one (decimal)\npenny in 1750 would have had roughly the same purchasing power as a pound in 1995.\nAlthough there was considerable fluctuation in price levels prior to 1914 (reflecting the\nquality of the harvest, wars, etc) there was not the long-term steady increase in prices\nassociated with the period since 1945. Prices in 1914 were roughly twice their level in 1750\nbut were below the level of the early Nineteenth Century. Prices doubled during the First\nWorld War but in most years between 1921 and 1938 prices fell or showed very small\n                                              \n     \n4 W Layton and G Crowther, An Introduction to the Study of Prices, 1935,\ntable 1\n     \n5 E H Phelps-Brown and S Hopkins, \"Seven Centuries of the Prices of\nConsumables compared with Builders' Wage-rates\", Economica November\n1956, pp296-314\n     \n6 Retail Prices Index Business Monitor MM23 table 14\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/18\nincreases. Although prices began to rise during the Second World War the increase was less\nmarked than during the First War. Since 1945 prices have risen in every year with an\naggregate rise of over 20 times. In the period 1974 to 1981 inflation was above 10% in each\nyear except 1978 and prices more than tripled in these eight years. Despite lower inflation\nrates in the late 1980s and early 1990s, prices rose by some 58% between 1985 and 1995.\nChart 1 (page 15) plots the price index for the period 1750 to 1995. Although such a graph\nillustrates the extent to which the absolute increase in prices has been concentrated in recent\nyears, it over-emphasises the proportional impact. For example, in chart 1 a doubling of the\nprice index in the Eighteenth Century from, say, 5 to 10 appears to be much less significant\nthan a doubling in the 1970s from 100 to 200. Such problems can be overcome by use of\na logarithmic scale as in chart 2 (page 16). With a logarithmic scale, equal proportional\nincreases have the same vertical displacement whatever the initial value. Charts 3 and 4\n(pages 17 & 18) plot the value of the pound on linear and logarithmic scales respectively.\nChart 5 (page 19) plots the rate of inflation in each year.\nTable 2 (page 20) shows the value of the pound at 20 year intervals between 1755 and 1995.\nIn each column the value of the pound is equivalent to 100 pence in a different year. Table\n3 (page 21) provides a similar analysis for each year since 1976.\n8\n\n\nTable 1\nValue of the Pound 1750 to 1995\nYear Price Value of Increase \nindex the pound in prices \n1974=100 1974= on

This compares with annual growth\nrates in excess of 5% in 1994. In November, output was 0.5% higher than its October level.\n* Compared with the three months to August, overall manufacturing production in the period September\nto November was 0.1% lower. Over this period growth was strongest in the coke, petrol refining &\nnuclear fuels sector (+5.6%) and weakest in food, drink & tobacco sector (-1.5%).\n* Compared with the three months to August, output in the mining and quarrying sector (including\nextraction of oil and natural gas) in the last three months was 4.4% higher but production in the gas,\nelectricity & water supply industries was 2.0% lower partly reflecting the mild weather in October.

Strong productivity growth continued in 1993 and 1994 and was\nparticularly strong in the second half of 1994. During 1995 the\ngrowth in manufacturing productivity declined, matching the fall in\nthe growth of manufacturing output. By November 1995 the index\nof output per head in manufacturing was actually lower than in\nNovember 1994.\n* Having shown a slight fall in 1989 and no change in 1990, economy-\nwide productivity increased by 0.8% in 1991 and 2.1% in 1992.\nThere were further improvements in 1993 and 1994 with increases in\neconomy-wide productivity of 3.3% in both years.\n* Data showing output per hour in manufacturing have been temporarily\nwithdrawn. New indices are being constructed and should be\navailable later this year.\nNext update: 14 February\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/17\nC 1.

          "Unemployment by Constituency\nJanuary 1996\nResearch Paper 96/24\n14 February 1996\nOfficial unemployment rates for parliamentary constituencies only exist for those few\nconstituencies which are self-contained labour markets. This paper is the latest of a monthly\nseries which presents up-to-date unemployment rates not available elsewhere, using official\nfigures for the number of unemployed claimants and estimates of the 1988 economically\nactive population in each GB constituency. This edition also includes residence-based\nunemployment rates for constituencies in Northern Ireland; however, these are on a slightly\ndifferent basis from those for constituencies in Great Britain.\nThis is likely to be the last Paper presenting monthly unemployment data in this format. The\nCentral Statistical Office intend to move to a 1991 ward base for the unemployment statistics\nfrom March, which will mean that for many constituencies it will no longer be possible to\nmake comparisons with previously published data. It is intended that to take this opportunity\nto update the denominators used to calculate constituency unemployment rates.\nJane Dyson\nEconomic Policy Paul Mann\n& Statistics Section Statistics Resource Unit\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n                                                                   \nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

Unemployment rates in this publication may not be\nreproduced without sufficient acknowledgement.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/24\nI Introduction\nOfficial unemployment rates for parliamentary constituencies only exist for those few\nconstituencies which are self-contained labour markets. This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not available elsewhere. These use official figures for the number of\nunemployed claimants and, in the case of GB constituencies, estimates of the 1988\neconomically active population (provided by CACI (Information Services) Ltd). For Northern\nIreland constituencies, figures were derived from the 1991 Census of Population for the\nnumber of people who are economically active in each constituency. At present, therefore,\nthe unemployment rates for the seventeen constituencies in Northern Ireland are not\ncomparable with those for constituencies in Great Britain. It is hoped to be able to introduce\na set of denominators that will be comparable for all UK constituencies in the March 1996\nResearch Paper.\nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nBackground Paper No. 292.\nThis paper also shows the change in the number of unemployed claimants in each\nconstituency 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ago. Seasonally adjusted figures for the number of\nunemployed claimants are not available below regional level so meaningful comparisons can\nonly be made between the same months in successive years. Even these are affected by\nchanges in the method used to compile unemployment statistics for which no adjustments\nhave been made.\nNotes:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The following\nabbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\n2.

If they are employees, they may\nchoose to take their case to an industrial tribunal, in which case compensation would\nnot be subject to the usual £11,300 limit and they would not need the usual two years'\nservice\n• It provides that people making protected disclosures cannot be found guilty of an\noffence under an enactment (such as the Official Secrets Act 1989) which prohibits\ndisclosure of information\n• The existing law of confidence allows a public interest defence against actions for\nbreach of confidence and the case law is reflected in the Bill\n• The Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 has already introduced\nlimited statutory protection for whistleblowers in health and safety cases\n• The Bill also covers the public service where there are special considerations \n• The Official Secrets Act 1989 removed the disclosure of much official information\nfrom the scope of the criminal law but contains no public interest defence to the\noffences which remain. The Bill, in effect, provides a narrow public interest defence\nin protected disclosure cases\n• The new Civil Service Code of Conduct covering disclosure takes account of\nrecommendations from the Nolan Committee and requires Departments to nominate\nan officer charged with the duty of investigating staff concerns raised confidentially\n• The Department of Health issued guidance on relations with the public and the media\nin 1993. This encourages employers to establish local procedures for handling staff\nconcerns but allows disclosure to the media as a last resort, even though it may result\nin disciplinary action\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\n• The Bill also protects journalists from having to disclose a source (who has made a\npublic interest disclosure to them) \"in the interests of justice\" under section 10 of the\nContempt of Court Act 1981\n• There is legislation in the USA and in some Australian states protecting\nwhistleblowers, but it mainly applies to the public sector\n• A series of reports on disasters, including the Piper Alpha oil platform explosion and\nthe Clapham rail crash, has suggested that they might have been averted had\nemployees been more prepared to speak up about malpractice\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nI The Bill\nA Background\nDon Touhig, who won sixth place in the ballot for Private Members Bills on 23 November\n1995, has introduced a Bill \"to protect individuals who make certain disclosures of\ninformation in the public interest; to allow such individuals to bring action in respect of\nvictimisation; to protect the identity of sources of information in certain cases; and for\nconnected purposes\".5 The Bill has all party support and was drawn up with the help of the\nCampaign for Freedom of Information and the organisation, Public Concern at Work,\nestablished in 1993 to assist employees who want to raise concerns about serious malpractice\nat their place of work, but fear victimisation if they do so. It follows Dr Tony Wright's\nWhistleblower Protection Bill which was introduced under the ten minute rule on 28 June\n1995 but made no further progress.6\nA consultation exercise was carried out after the introduction of that Bill and responses\nreceived from employers, unions and other interested organisations. Many of the employers\nwho responded (including Forte, Cadbury Schweppes, Thorn EMI, BT and the TSB)\nsupported the general principles of the Bill and its aim of encouraging greater openness in the\nworkplace. They were concerned that the detail of the legislation should be such as to\nencourage internal disclosure, leaving wider disclosure very much as a last resort. Some of\nthe unions (for example, the GMB and the MSF) thought that the limitations on the type of\ninformation which could be disclosed were too extensive and would leave some apparently\nmeritorious whistleblowers without protection. Several changes were made to the Bill as a\nresult of comments made during the consultation process and the present Bill stresses the\nrequirement that internal channels should be used first if protection is to be afforded. One\nprovision removed altogether was that preventing employers from insuring against the cost\nof compensating someone penalised for justifiable whistleblowing.\nB The Bill's Provisions\nThe Bill would protect employees who blow the whistle on serious fraud and malpractice by:\n• establishing a category of \"public interest disclosures\" which are disclosures of\ninformation obtained in the course of one's employment, profession, voluntary work,\nresponsibilities as an office holder or a contractor or membership of an organisation\nand which tend to show evidence of significant malpractice. Examples of such\nmalpractice are illegality, improper use of funds, abuse of authority, miscarriage of\njustice, maladministration or danger to health and safety. The information must also\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 Public Interest Disclosure Bill, Bill 20 of 1995/96\n6 Bill 152 of 1994/95\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nbe such that in an action for breach of confidence the court had found or would be\nlikely to find that its disclosure was justified in the public interest.\n[Clause 1 and the Schedule]\n• defining a \"protected disclosure\" as a public interest disclosure made by someone\nwho:\n- is not acting in bad faith\n- believes on reasonable grounds that their information is accurate\n- is not acting principally for the purpose of obtaining payment or\npersonal gain\n- has taken reasonable steps to raise the matter internally before making\nthe disclosure. This requirement is only waived if the matter has\nalready been raised internally and the individual penalised as a result.\nIn addition, an internal disclosure about serious misconduct or malpractice\nwould be protected as long as the individual was not acting in bad faith. The\nother requirements listed above would not apply. Any subsequent external\ndisclosures would still need to meet the full range of tests. Disclosure to a\nlegal adviser is fully protected in all circumstances (but that adviser would not\nbe able to disclose the information without the consent of his client).\n[Clause 2]\n• giving remedies to people making, or proposing to make, protected disclosures by\nproviding that they\n- cannot be penalised (eg by dismissal, being made redundant or other forms of\nadverse treatment) [Clause 3]\n- cannot be found guilty of an offence under an enactment which\nprohibits disclosure of information (eg the Official Secrets Act 1989)\n[Clause 3]\n- can bring an action in court for compensation or an injunction if they\nare penalised. Compensation should \"have regard to all the\ncircumstances of the case\" including any injury, loss, damage or\ndistress to the plaintiff and the conduct of both plaintiff and defendant.\n[Clause 4]\n- can, if an employee, seek compensation for unfair dismissal from an\nindustrial tribunal even if they have been employed for less than two\nyears with their employer or are over retirement age. In addition, the\nusual limit of £11,300 on unfair dismissal compensation awards will\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nnot apply. Any compensation will be calculated in the same way as that\nfor people taking their case to court. If the tribunal orders re-\nengagement or re-instatement, and the employer does not comply, a\nspecial award can be made. [Clause 5] \n- can seek interim relief to prevent dismissal taking place before a\ntribunal hearing [Clause 5]\n- can seek compensation from an industrial tribunal for any penalty other\nthan dismissal (eg victimisation, discrimination, adverse treatment). \nSuch compensation will be calculated in the same way as that for those\nwho suffer detriment for raising health and safety concerns (see Part III\nbelow). [Clause 5]\n• placing the burden of proof on public bodies to show that it is not in the public\ninterest to disclose information they hold. [Clause 6]. \"Public bodies\" are defined to\ninclude not only government departments, agencies and local authorities but also\nquangos and any body \"at least half of whose revenues derive directly\" from money\nprovided by Parliament or charges authorised by Act of Parliament. [Clause 9]. This\nis a reversal of the burden of proof. In the case of private sector organisations it\nwould be up to the individual to show that it was in the public interest that\ninformation should be disclosed.\n• preventing out of court settlements from imposing confidentiality clauses in respect\nof information which has been shown to be protected under the legislation. \n[Clause 7]\n• providing that journalists or publishers to whom a public interest disclosure has been\nmade cannot be required to disclose their sources in the interests of justice under\nsection 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. Disclosure can still be required if it\nis in the interests of national security or the prevention of disorder or crime. \n[Clause 8]\n• ensuring that the Bill's protection covers Crown employees. [Clause 10]. The right\nto claim unfair dismissal does not apply to Crown employees in respect of whom a\nMinisterial certificate has been issued stating that such an exception is necessary in\nthe interests of national security.7 However, the Bill's protection will apply in such\ncases, as it does in health and safety cases. [Clause 5(4)(e)]\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n7 Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, s 138 (4)\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nII Existing Law\nAs a general rule, \"whistleblowing\" would be a breach of contract, for both public and private\nsector employees. Sometimes the duty of confidentiality is an express term of a contract of\nemployment (so-called \"gagging clauses\") but all contracts of employment involve an implied\n\"duty of fidelity\" which requires honest, loyal and faithful service and forbids competition\nwith the employer. It also means that an employee must not reveal the employer's trade\nsecrets or other confidential information. This duty is not absolute and, in certain\ncircumstances, an employee might be able to defend himself against an action for breach of\nconfidentiality by arguing that he acted in the public interest. An Incomes Data Services\nBrief explains:\n\"Whether this defence can be made out in any particular case will depend on\nthe court's assessment of competing public interests, one in the preservation of\nconfidence, the other in the public's 'right to know' of wrongdoing. The\nprocess was summarised by Lord Griffiths in Attorney General v Guardian\nNewspapers Ltd & ors (no 2) ('Spycatcher No 2'), when he stated that: 'This\ninvolves the judge in balancing the public interest in upholding the right to\nconfidence, which is based on the moral principles of loyalty and fair dealing,\nagainst some other public interest that will be served by the publication of\nconfidential material.' \"8\nTwo examples of successful public interest defences are Initial Services v Putterill & anor9\nand Lion Laboratories Ltd v Evans & ors.10 In the first, an employee disclosed to the Daily\nMail information about a price-fixing arrangement his employer had reached with his\ncompetitors in the laundry sector. Not only should this agreement have been registered under\nthe Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 but the employer put out a misleading circular to the\neffect that the increases were necessitated by a new employment tax. In the second, two\nscientists who had worked at the laboratory disclosed to a national newspaper confidential\ninformation which raised serious doubts about the reliability of a breathalyser approved for\nuse by the Home Office.\nHowever, the Courts have taken a fairly firm line on this and the principle of confidentiality\nis accorded great weight.11 An employer would be able to dismiss a whistleblower for breach\nof contract and it is unlikely that an industrial tribunal would find such a dismissal unfair.\nTwo examples of unsuccessful unfair dismissal claims are Thornley v Aircraft Research\nAssociation Ltd12 and Byford v Film Finances Ltd.13 In the former, T had grave concerns over\na project he was working on and, after purporting to bring these concerns to his employer's\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 IDS Brief, 544, July 1995, \"Whistleblowing\"\n9 [1967] 3 All ER 145\n10 [1985] QB 526\n11 See, for example, Industrial Relations Law Bulletin 483, Oct. 1993: \"Guidance Note: Confidentiality and\nDisclosure of Information: Employees' Rights and Duties\".\n12 EAT 669/76\n13 EAT 804/86\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nattention, published the results of research he had been carrying out by writing to a national\nnewspaper. T was dismissed and the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the industrial\ntribunal's ruling that the dismissal was fair. In Byford, B considered it likely that the directors\nof the company were carrying out illegal activities in connection with share transfers. She\nleaked the information to minority shareholders and was eventually dismissed. The EAT\nupheld the industrial tribunal's ruling that the dismissal was fair. It is unlikely that the Bill\nwould make any difference to these decisions because the whistleblowers had not used the\nproper channels. Even if an unfair dismissal claim were to succeed under present rules,\ncompensation would be limited to £11,30014 and only those with continuous service of two\nyears with their employer would be able to apply.15 This contrasts with the legislation\nprotecting employees against sex and race discrimination. People can apply to an industrial\ntribunal for compensation however short their service, and, since 1993 and 1994 respectively,\nthere has been no limit on the amount of compensation which can be awarded.16 \nAnother much quoted case is the Granada case.17 The British Steel Corporation sought\ndisclosure of a \"mole\" who had approached Granada with allegations of poor management and\nbad practices within the Corporation. The House of Lords found in favour of BSC, Lord\nWilberforce remarking that \"the most that it is said the papers reveal is mismanagement and\ngovernment intervention.\" In general, case law is more likely to support whistleblowers who\nhave tried to raise concerns through internal channels and proper regulators and less likely to\nsupport those who use the media. This approach is reflected in the Bill.\nIII Existing Statutory Protection\nThere are some specific statutory protections for whistleblowers in the areas of health and\nsafety, asserting statutory employment rights and sex and race discrimination.\nSection 28 and Schedule 5 of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993\n[TURER], which came into force on 30 August 1993, already provide a certain amount of\nprotection to whistleblowers in the sphere of health and safety. They give all employees,\nregardless of length of service, hours of work or age, the right not to be dismissed, selected\nfor redundancy or subjected to any other detriment for:\n(a) carrying out or proposing to carry out any health and\nsafety activities for which they are designated by their\nemployer;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 Employment Protection Consolidation Act 1978, section 75 and the Employment Protection (Increase of\nLimits) Order 1995 SI No. 1953\n15 EPCA, section 64\n16 The Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay (Remedies) Regulations 1993 SI No 2798, and the Race Relations\n(Remedies) Act 1994\n17 [1981] AC 1097\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\n(b) performing or proposing to perform any functions that\nthey have as official or employer-acknowledged health\nand safety representatives or committee members;\n(c) bringing to their employer's attention, by reasonable\nmeans and in the absence of a representative or\ncommittee who could do so on their behalf, a reasonable\nhealth or safety concern;\n(d) in the event of danger which they reasonably believed\nto be serious and imminent and which they could not\nreasonably be expected to avert, leaving or proposing to\nleave the workplace or any dangerous part of it, or\n(while the danger persisted) refusing to return; and\n(e) in circumstances of danger which they reasonably\nbelieved to be serious and imminent, taking or\nproposing to take appropriate steps to protect themselves\nor other persons from the danger.18\nEmployees who suffer detriment (short of dismissal) as a result of the above actions can take\na complaint to an industrial tribunal. If the complaint is upheld, the tribunal must award such\ncompensation as it considers \"just and equitable in all the circumstances, having regard to the\ninfringement complained of and to any loss\" the employee has suffered as a result. There is\nno limit to the amount of compensation payable under this provision. If the employee is\ndismissed, the tribunal may grant a number of remedies, namely reinstatement, re-engagement,\ncompensation and a declaration. Compensation will, as usual, consist of a basic and a\ncompensatory award. However, health and safety representatives and committee members\nacting in accordance with (a) or (b) above are entitled to enhanced remedies. For example,\nif reinstatement or re-engagement is ordered but the employer does not comply, a special\naward of 156 weeks' pay or £20,600, whichever is the greater, can be made.\nThis amendment to the law was necessary to implement properly Article 8(4) of the EC\nHealth and Safety Framework Directive.19 It can now be found as sections 22A-22C and 57A\nof the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 [EPCA]. Cases already heard under\nthese new provisions suggest that they protect people raising potential dangers to themselves\nor their colleagues in their own place of work, but not those who raise issues of wider\nconcern to the general public.20 Examples of successful claims include a heavy goods vehicle\ndriver on a three month trial who was dismissed when he complained about a serious defect\nin the vehicle he was driving;21 a van driver dismissed when he refused to drive a van with\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n18 Dept. of Employment Press Release, 1 July 1993 : \"David Hunt promises early implementation as Act\nreceives Royal Assent\"\n19 89/391/EEC\n20 IDS Brief 544, op cit\n21 Winters v Main Aspects Ltd t/a West Mid Transport Services, COIT 2930/232\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\na hole in the floor;22 and a 16 year old girl dismissed when she refused to take rubbish bags,\nunaccompanied, to an unlighted garage at about 10 pm.23\nTURER also introduced a new protection against dismissal for asserting a statutory\nemployment right. This provision is contained in section 29 of the Act, which inserted a new\nsection 60A in the EPCA, and it also came into effect on 30 August 1993. It means that\nanyone dismissed or selected for redundancy because he is trying to enforce his right to such\nthings as a written statement of his terms and conditions or an itemised pay statement can be\ncompensated by an industrial tribunal.\nSection 2(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 and section 4(1) of the Sex Discrimination Act\n1975 protect employees who raise concerns about discrimination in the workplace against\nvictimisation on that account.\nIV Pros and Cons\nThe general arguments in favour of protecting whistleblowers, and hence encouraging\nwhistleblowing, are:\n• disasters, such as the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987 or the\nexplosion of the Piper Alpha oil platform in 1988, might have been avoided if\nemployees had dared to express their concerns or these concerns had been taken more\nseriously\n• it is in the enlightened self-interest of organisations that their employees should feel\nfree to raise concerns so that they can be dealt with before disaster occurs and the\norganisation's reputation is damaged\n• knowledge of potential disclosure would be a deterrent to malpractice\n• it would provide redress for public spirited people who suffer discrimination or\nvictimisation as a result of attempts to blow the whistle. Many cases have been\nreported in the press and on television where people have allegedly been dismissed or\nmade redundant as a result of whistle blowing and suffered financial loss and\nemotional stress as a result.24\n• it reduces the need to establish regulatory authorities as employees act as watchdogs\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n22 Rawlings v Barraclough t/a Independent Delivery Service, COIT 2967/239\n23 Clark v Falkirk Sunbed Solarium & Ladies Health Club Ltd, Case No. S/5057/94\n24 See, eg, Channel 4's Cutting Edge programme, 29 January 1996; Guardian, 3 October 1995, \"Colonial\nMutual 'traitor' to sue after firm makes him redundant\"; Guardian, 18 May 1994, \"Official who blew the\nwhistle 'made to quit'\"; Times, 8 January 1994, \"Whistle-blower sacked unfairly\"\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nThe general arguments against are:\n• the duty of confidentiality is important in protecting commercially sensitive\ninformation\n• the duty of confidentiality is also important in protecting personal information which\nmay be of interest to the public, but which is not against the public interest\n• incorrect or misleading information may be disclosed, so unfairly damaging the\nreputation of the employer\n• it might encourage \"sneaking\" and \"whingeing\" and troublemakers with a grudge\nagainst an organisation\n• whilst protection for those who raise concerns internally or even with official\nregulators is uncontroversial, protection for those who go to the media is less so\nThe Bill seeks to meet these arguments by:\n• the requirement that only information whose disclosure a court would find justified in\nthe public interest is protected in external cases. In other words, the existing law on\nconfidentiality is not affected by the Bill\n• the absence of protection for external disclosures where the discloser does not have\nreasonable grounds for believing the information to be accurate\n• the absence of protection for people acting in bad faith\n• the provision that external disclosure is only protected if internal channels have failed\nFrom another point of view, commentators might feel that the Bill does not go far enough in\nthe protection it offers. The Court's view of what is in the public interest might well be much\nmore limited than that of the whistleblower. The Bill would not, for example, protect\nsomeone who was expressing a political or ethical point of view: perhaps the hospital\nconsultant complaining that lack of resources was putting patients' lives at risk. Employers\nand employees would be unlikely to know what a court would consider to be in the public\ninterest. Many who responded to the consultation exercise on the Whistleblower Protection\nBill suggested that there should be a Code of Practice accompanying the legislation, and even\na \"Protected Information Disclosure Agency\" to give guidance and to assist in enforcement.\nThe Whistleblower Protection Bill protected people who failed to raise a matter internally if\nit was reasonable to assume that doing so would be ineffective or the urgency of the matter\nrequired immediate disclosure. This Bill only protects such people if someone has actually\nbeen penalised already for trying to raise the same matter internally.\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nV Public Concern at Work\nPublic Concern at Work provides free legal advice and assistance to employees who are\nconcerned about serious malpractice which threatens the public interest. It is a charity\nestablished in October 1993 in the wake of a series of inquiries into disasters and scandals\nwhich revealed that employee concerns were either not raised or not heeded. A list of such\nreports is contained in the Appendix to this paper. Public Concern at Work's objects are: \"to\npromote good practice and compliance with the law in the public, private and voluntary\nsectors\". It does this by focusing on \"the accountability of those in charge and the\nresponsibility of those at work\". Its strategy is to:\n- provide free and confidential help to employees and\nothers concerned about serious malpractice and public\ndangers in the workplace\n- encourage employers to set up procedures for employees\nto raise serious concerns about dangers and malpractice\n- seek to ensure that employees can use those mechanisms\nwithout fear of victimisation and in the knowledge that\ntheir concerns will be addressed\n- publicise good practice in all sectors\n- conduct research into issues of public and corporate\ngovernance; and\n- encourage people to play their part in preventing and\navoiding serious danger and harm to the public good.25\nBecause the charity is a legal advice centre, employees can consult its lawyers without\nbreaching any term in their employment contract or any duty of confidence or loyalty owed\nto the employer.26 In their first year of operation, they received 620 requests for legal advice.\n51% related to the private sector; 38% to the public sector and 11% to the voluntary sector.\n386 of the cases were classified as public concerns (ie allegations of serious malpractice\nwhich threatened the public or amounted to a serious breach of the law.) Of these, 49%\ninvolved financial malpractice, 22% workplace safety and 17% public safety.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n25 Public Concern at Work, First Annual Report 1994\n26 Public Concern at Work, Raising concerns at work\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nVI Government Policy\nSo far, the Government has not expressed a view on the Bill. In his response to the\nconsultation on the Whistleblower Protection Bill, Roger Freeman, Minister for Public\nService, said: \"Most of your Bill falls in the areas of Ministerial colleagues' responsibilities\nand it would not be right for me to comment in detail, but speaking for the Civil Service I\nam committed to ensuring that we have arrangements that both resolve genuine concerns and\nsustain the mutual confidence and confidentiality that should exist between all employers and\nemployed.\"27\nVII Labour Party Policy\nDuring the 1995 Labour Party Conference, Harriet Harman, then front bench spokeswoman\non employment, gave the Whistleblower Protection Bill the party's backing at a fringe\nmeeting. She also told IRS Employment Trends that should the Private Members' Bill be\nunsuccessful, a future Labour government would bring in the necessary legislation, together\nwith its proposed freedom of information bill.28\nVIII Public Bodies\nThere are additional issues involved where public service employees are concerned. The Law\nLords have stated that there is a continuing public interest that the workings of government\nshould be open to scrutiny and criticism. In the Spycatcher case, Lord Goff of Chievely\nstressed that whereas in an ordinary private case of confidentiality it is not incumbent upon\nthe party seeking to preserve confidence to show that it is in the public interest that\npublication shold not occur, it is a requirement in the case of government secrets, that the\ngovernment should positively show that the public interest lies in publication being prevented.\nThe reason for this additional requirement is that in a free society there is a continuing public\ninterest that the workings of government should be open to scrutiny and criticism. On the\nother hand, civil servants are subject to the Official Secrets Act as well as to the civil law.29\nThey are also \"servants of the Crown\" and \"owe a duty of loyal service to the Crown as their\nemployer\". The Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, published in March\n1994, \"supports the Government's policy under the Citizen's Charter of extending access to\nofficial information, and responding to reasonable requests for information, except where\ndisclosure would not be in the public interest\". Part II of the Code lists, under fifteen\nheadings, the categories of information exempt from the disclosure requirement. They range\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n27 Letter to Tony Wright, MP, 29 August 1995\n28 IRS Employment Trends, November 1995, \"Whistleblowers gain rapid acceptance after Nolan\"\n29 See, for example, the discussion in Sandra Fredman and Gillian S Morris: \"The State as Employer: Labour\nLaw in the Public Services\" (1989), pp 224-232 on 'Freedom of Expression'.\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nfrom \"defence, security and international relations\" to \"publication and prematurity in relation\nto publication\".\nA. Official Secrets Act\nThe Official Secrets Act 1989 repealed and replaced the \"catch-all\" section 2 of the Official\nSecrets Act 1911. It was enacted following long standing concern over the catch-all nature\nof section 2 of the 1911 Act and the refusal of juries to convict in a small number of cases\nwhere a literal application of the law should have ensured the conviction of the accused. In\naddition there was momentum for change towards more open government. The 1989 Act is\nof general application but has special significance for Crown servants and government\ncontractors who are more likely to be in possession of official information.\nThe 1989 Act removed the disclosure of much official information from the scope of the\ncriminal law. It introduced six categories of official information the disclosure of which is\nnow subject to criminal sanction. These categories are:\n• security and intelligence\n• defence\n• international relations\n• information obtained in confidence from other States or from international\norganisations\n• information likely to result in the commission of an offence or likely to impede the\nprevention or detection of offences\n• special investigations under statutory warrant (eg interception of communications)\nIn the first five of these categories the prosecution must prove specific tests of harm for cases\ninvolving unauthorised disclosure. In the case of those who are not Crown servants or\ngovernment contractors the prosecution also has to prove that the defendant knew or had good\nreason to know that the specific harm was likely to have been caused. However disclosures\nby members of the security and intelligence services and others connected with those services\nwill always be treated as harmful. \nIn the case of special investigations under statutory warrant the prosecution must prove that\nthe offence related to the disclosure of information about or obtained by action under a\nrelevant statutory warrant authorised by the Secretary of State.\nIt is no longer an offence merely to receive information covered by the 1989 Act.\nThe Act contains no public interest defence despite a number of attempts to introduce one as\nthe Bill proceeded through Parliament.30 The Ponting trial in 1985 had been seen by some\ncommentators as paving the way for some form of public interest defence following Mr\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n30 see, for example, HC Deb 2 February 1989, c441ff and HC Deb 22 February 1989, c1039ff\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nPonting's acquittal by the jury. However the Government took the view that the harm tests\ngave a clear indication to the courts of disclosures that would not be in the public interest.\nIt also took the view that an overarching public interest defence would allow any amount of\ndamage on the grounds that the information disclosed gave reasonable cause to believe that\nthere had been some neglect of public duty - in other words, the damage would be done and\nit would only be afterwards that the reasonableness of the individual's belief could be\nassessed.31 Prosecutions are, however, always a matter of discretion and it is possible that\ndespite the absence of an overarching public interest defence an individual would not be\nprosecuted under the 1989 Act for a disclosure made in breach of that Act but in\ncircumstances that revealed an obvious public interest in making that disclosure.\nClause 3(b) of the current Bill seeks to protect an individual who made a disclosure in\ncontravention of the 1989 Act which tended to show \"significant misconduct or malpractice\"\nof such kind as suggested in Schedule 1 to the Bill. This would in effect introduce a public\ninterest defence to individuals charged under the 1989 Act. An individual seeking to rely on\nthis defence would have to comply with other provisions of the Bill which set out the\ncircumstances in which such a defence could be claimed (see Part I above). The Notes on\nClauses to the current Bill produced by Public Concern at Work state that \"the burden of\ndemonstrating an overriding public interest in relation to a disclosure to which the Official\nSecrets Act applies will be much greater than that for other confidential information\".32 This\nis not something that appears on the face of the Bill but the statement appears to be based on\nan assessment of the strong duty of confidentiality owed by civil servants and of the likely\napproach of the courts in balancing that duty with the public interest. \nB. Civil Service\nCivil Servants have a duty of confidentiality over and above the requirements of the Official\nSecrets Act 1989 (see above). The Armstrong memorandum on the Duties and\nResponsibilities of Civil Servants in relation to ministers was first issued after Clive Ponting\nwas acquitted of breaking s.2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 in leaking information on the\nBelgrano affair to Tam Dalyell. It stated \"any such unauthorised disclosures whether for\npolitical or for personal motives, or for pecuniary gain, and quite apart from liability to\nprosecution under the Official Secrets Act, result in the Civil Servant forfeiting the trust that\nis put in him or her as an employee and making him or her liable to disciplinary action\nincluding the possibility of dismissal, or civil law proceedings\".33\nThe Armstrong memorandum has now been superseded by the Civil Service Code of Conduct\nwith effect from 1 January 1996.34 The Civil Service code does highlight the question of\ndisciplinary action but rephrases the Armstrong memorandum's concerns about confidentiality:\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n31 Further discussion of these matters is contained in Library Reference Sheet 88/7 on the Official Secrets\nBill and in Library Research Note 437 on The Official Secrets Bill 1988-89: The Commons Debates\n32 p6\n33 para. 8 of 4.1, Annex A, Civil Service Management Code, February 1993\n34 The Code has been incorporated into the Civil Service Management Code\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\n9. Civil servants should conduct themselves in such a way as to deserve and retain the\nconfidence of Ministers and to be able to establish the same relationship with those whom\nthey may be required to serve in some future Administration. They should comply with\nrestrictions on their political activities. The conduct of civil servants should be such that\nMinisters and potential future Ministers can be sure that confidence can be freely given, and\nthat the Civil Service will conscientiously fulfil its duties and obligations to, and impartially\nassist, advise and carry out the policies of the duly constituted Government.\n10. Civil servants should not without authority disclose official information which has been\ncommunicated in confidence within Government, or received in confidence from others.\nNothing in the Code should be taken as overriding existing statutory or common law\nobligations to keep confidential, or to disclose, certain information. They should not seek to\nfrustrate or influence the policies, decisions or actions of Government by the unauthorised,\nimproper or premature disclosure outside the Government of any information to which they\nhave had access as civil servants.\nDisclosures by civil servants which are not subject to the criminal law under the Official\nSecrets Act 1989 may nevertheless be the subject of a civil action for breach of confidence.\nRules of Conduct and Discipline contained in the Civil Service Management Code note as\nfollows:\n\"Civil Servants must not misuse information which they acquire\nin the course of their official duties or disclose information\nwhich is held in confidence within Government.\"35\nThe First Division Association of Civil Servants and the Institution of Professionals, Managers\nand Specialists campaigned for some years for a code of ethics which would allow civil\nservants to appeal to a Civil Service Ethics Tribunal consisting of three Privy Counsellors\ndrawn from across the political parties.36 The Government first announced that an appeal to\nthe Civil Service Commissioners would be introduced in January 1995 when responding to\nthe Treasury and Civil Service Committee report on the Civil Service37 which had\nrecommended a code of ethics.38\nThe Nolan Committee39 recommended amendments to the draft Code of Conduct so that \n it covered circumstances in which a civil servant, while not personally involved, was\naware of wrongdoing or maladministration taking place\n all successful appeals to the Civil Service Commissioners, whether the Government\nhas heeded the recommendation or not, should be reported to Parliament \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n35 para. 4.1.3 (a) Civil Service Management Code. Note that the Code sets out general principles and rules\nwhich departments may supplement, but departmental rules must fully reflect the central framework set out\nin the Code on conduct and discipline\n36 IPMS/FDA Draft Civil Service Code of Ethics 21 November 1994\n37 HC 27 1993/94\n38 The Civil Service : Taking Forward Continuity and Change, Cm 2748\n39 First Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, Cm 2850\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\n all departments and agencies should nominate one or more officials entrusted with the\nduty of investigating staff concerns raised confidentially40\n there should be regular surveys of the knowledge and understanding that staff have of\nethical standards applicable to them\nThe Government accepted the majority of these recommendations in its response to Nolan.41\nIt promised to bring forward amendments to the Civil Service Management Code to require\nagencies and departments to nominate an official to investigate staff concerns raised\nconfidentially.42\nThese arrangements have now been put in place, as set out in Annex C to the Government\nresponse:\n7.7.5 Paragraph 11 of the Civil Service Code provides for internal reviews of crises of\nconscience and other matters:\n\"Where a civil servant believes he or she is being required to act in a\nway which is illegal, improper, unethical, in breach of constitutional\nconvention or a professional code, which may involve possible\nmaladministration, or which is otherwise inconsistent with this Code, he\nor she should report the matter in accordance with procedures laid\ndown in departmental guidance or rules of conduct. A civil servant\nshould also report to the appropriate authorities evidence of criminal or\nunlawful activity by others and may also report in accordance with\ndepartmental procedures if he or she becomes aware of other breaches\nof this Code or is otherwise required to act in a way which, for him or\nher, raises a fundamental issue of conscience.\"\n7.7.6  Departments and agencies must establish clearly-defined formal procedures for\nhandling such complaints. While many complaints will be raised through the management\nline, there should also be a nominated official or officials who can be approached in\nconfidence in the first instance. The internal resolution procedures will normally involve the\nPermanent Head of Department or Agency Chief Executive. Departments and agencies should\nensure that staff feel confident to voice complaints, and are not penalised for raising concerns\nin accordance with the procedures. Clear guidance on the procedures should be available to\nall staff.\nStaff would not be required to use the confidential channel proposed.\nThe Government also agreed to amend the Civil Service code to cover circumstances where\ncivil servants were aware of wrongdoing or maladministration, but preferred the terms of\n'evidence of criminal or unlawful activity'. The Government response stated that 'there might\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n40 paras. 5-54 of chapter 3 Cm 2850\n41 Response to the First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life Cm 2931 July 1995\n42 Response to Recommendation 25\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nbe room for confusion about what these words covered and whether or not they embraced the\nfull range of principles addressed by the Code'.43\nThe Government refused however to accept the recommendation that all successful appeals\nto the Commissioners be reported to Parliament:\nIn the Government's view it is important to protect the confidential nature\nof the relationship between Ministers and civil servants, including the\nconfidentiality of policy advice and internal discussion. There will be no\nrestrictions on access to such advice by the Civil Service Commissioners\nwhere it is necessary for them to see it in order to investigate a concern.\nLaying the Commissioners' report on a case before Parliament when the\nGovernment has declined to accept a recommendation will support\nParliamentary accountability. The position is comparable to reports under\nsection 10(3) of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967, where the\nCommissioner has identified injustice arising from maladministration which\nit appears to him will not be remedied. The Government accepts, however,\nthat the Civil Service Commissioners should be able to report the outcome\nof cases in a wider range of circumstances, including those where a\nsatisfactory outcome has been achieved. It may be possible to report such\ncases in summary form, in a way which conveys any best practice lessons\nbut does not disclose the identity of those involved in the case. The\nGovernment is prepared to leave the nature and extent of reporting to the\nCommissioners, and trusts that it will be widely accepted that they should\ndischarge their responsibilities in a way which upholds the political\nimpartiality of the service and does not undermine the trust and confidence\nwhich forms the basis of the working relationship between Ministers and\ncivil servants.44\nFinally, the Government accepted that the recommendations on regular surveys should be\nimplemented flexibly and no arrangements would be prescribed from the centre.45\nA civil servant must therefore follow the procedures set out in the code:\n11. Where a civil servant believes he or she is being required to act in a\nway which:\n• is illegal, improper, or unethical;\n• is in breach of constitutional convention or a\nprofessional code; \n• may involve possible maladministration; or\n• is otherwise inconsistent with this Code;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n43 p.9\n44 Response to Recommendation 24\n45 Response to Recommendation 28\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nhe or she should report the matter in accordance with procedures laid\ndown in departmental guidance or rules of conduct. A civil servant\nshould also report to the appropriate authorities evidence of criminal or\nunlawful activity by others and may also report in accordance with\ndepartmental procedures if he or she becomes aware of other breaches\nof this Code or is required to act in a way which, for him or her, raises\na fundamental issue of conscience.\n12. Where a civil servant has reported a matter covered in paragraph 11 in\naccordance with procedures laid down in departmental guidance or rules\nof conduct and believes that the response does not represent a\nreasonable response to the grounds of his or her concern, he or she may\nreport the matter in writing to the Civil Service Commissioners.\n13. Civil servants should not seek to frustrate the policies, decisions or\nactions of Government by declining to take, or abstaining from, action\nwhich flows from ministerial decisions. Where a matter cannot be\nresolved by the procedures set out in paragraphs 11 and 12 above, on\na basis which the civil servant concerned is able to accept, he or she\nshould either carry out his or her instructions, or resign from the Civil\nService. Civil servants should continue to observe their duties of\nconfidentiality after they have left Crown employment.\nA civil servant whose concerns are not allayed by these procedures must therefore carry out\nministerial instructions or resign. He would still be bound by the duty of confidentiality. The\nIPMS/FDA Code of Ethics had included a sentence \"A civil servant should suffer no\ndetriment from referring to the tribunal an issue arising in the course of his or her work,\nwhether or not the complaint is upheld.\"\nClause 6 of the Bill reads 'in any action on which a public body claims that it is owed an\nobligation of confidentiality in respect of any information it shall be for that body to prove\nthat it was in the public interest that the information should be confidential.\" This is a\nreversal of the burden of proof. In a private sector case, it would be for the individual to show\nthat it was in the public interest that the information be disclosed. 'Public interest' is not\ndefined but cases concerning the public interest defence would be relevant; for the civil\nservant the Spycatcher cases offer precedents: in the second Spycatcher case Lord Goff of\nChievely stressed that \"it is incumbent on the Crown, in order to restrain disclosure of\nGovernment secrets, not only to show that the information is confidential, but also to show\nthat it is in the public interest that it should not be published.\"46\nClause 9 of the Bill defines a 'public body' as \n(a) a government department or agency or local authority or any body\nwhich is established by virtue of Her Majesty's prerogative or by an Act of\nParliament or an Order in Council or an Order made under an Act of Parliament\nor which is established in any other way by a Minister of the Crown in his\ncapacity as such or by a Public body, or\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n46 Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd others (no. 2) (Spycatcher no. 2) [1988] 3 All ER at p660\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\n(b) any body at least half of whose revenues derive directly from money\nprovided by Parliament, a levy authorised by an enactment, a fee or charge of\nany other description so authorised or more than one of those sources; or\n(c) any body which is wholly or partly constituted by appointment made by\nHer Majesty or a Minister of the Crown or a public body;\nThe term would therefore seem to include both Non-Departmental Public Bodies and bodies\nwhich have been loosely described by the Nolan Committee as local public spending bodies:\nTECs, LECs, Grant Maintained schools, further and higher education bodies and housing\nassociations. In addition the range of public sector bodies such as LEA schools, local\nauthorities and NHS bodies seem to be within the definition. Finally there is the question\nof contractors carrying out activities previously the responsibilities of civil servants, as part\nof the Competing for Quality Initiative, or the privatisation of Agencies. Their inclusion\nwithin the definition of public body seems doubtful unless at least half of the contractors'\nrevenues come directly from Government, yet employees of a private sector body contracted\nto perform public sector work may well be faced with the same ethical dilemmas as civil\nservants or public sector employees.\nC. National Health Service\nThe question of whistle-blowing has been the subject of particular concern in the NHS, both\nbecause of the potentially serious consequences of poor practice, and because of the belief,\nheld by some in the health service, that the introduction of the NHS \"internal market\" has led\nto a greater emphasis on secrecy. One case which attracted a great deal of publicity and\ncomment was that of Graham Pink, a nurse who was dismissed in 1991 after he publicised\nhis concerns over the standards of geriatric care in Stepping Hill Hospital. Mr Pink took his\ncase to an industrial tribunal, and in 1993 his employer, Stockport Health Authority, agreed\nto award him £11,000 in order to save further legal costs, although it continued to dispute Mr\nPink's claims.47\nIn October 1992, the Department of Health issued draft guidance for NHS staff on their\nrelations with the public and the media, with the final version published in June 1993.48 The\nguidance emphasises that the interests of patients must be paramount, and that all NHS\nemployees have a duty to draw their managers' attention to anything which they believe may\nbe putting patient welfare at risk. At the same time, NHS staff also have a duty of\nconfidentiality to their patients and an implied duty of confidentiality to their employers,\nregardless of whether or not this is made explicit in their contract. (This duty of confidence\nto an employer is not absolute, however, as the defence can be made that disclosure was in\nthe public interest.) In order to avoid the need for members of staff to publicise their\nconcerns outside the NHS, employers are directed to establish local procedures, both formal\nand informal, for handling such concerns about health care issues. Emphasis is placed on the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n47\n\"NHS 'whistle-blower' wins £11,000 damages\", The Independent, 15 June 1993 p.7\n48 Department of Health circular EL(93)51, 8 June 1993\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nimportance of fostering openness, so that staff feel free to raise their concerns without fear\nof reprisal. \nWhere these local procedures have been exhausted, and the member of staff concerned is still\ndissatisfied, then the guidance states that they must retain the right to consult their\nprofessional body or trade union, or a statutory body such as the General Medical Council.\nTheir Member of Parliament could also be consulted in confidence. Finally, the guidance\nstates that \"as a last resort\" the individual might consider disclosing their concerns to the\nmedia. However, \"such action, if entered into unjustifiably, could result in disciplinary action\nand might unreasonably undermine public confidence in the Service\". As local procedures will\nhave been agreed with staff representatives in the first place, it is envisaged that \"proper\nmechanisms will exist to ensure that staff concerns can be addressed and dealt with without\nreference to the media\".\nAlthough the press notice announcing the draft document stated that \"the right of NHS staff\nto speak out on their concerns about health care would be confirmed as a recognised and\nacceptable part of NHS life\"49, representatives of NHS staff remain unconvinced. Christine\nHancock of the Royal College of Nursing was quoted as describing the guidance as\n\"toothless\"50 while a spokeswoman for the British Medical Association was reported as saying\nthat there remained \"a climate of fear in the service\".51 In 1994, the union MSF carried out\na survey among its representatives in the NHS to gauge the effect of the guidance; according\nto the survey results, 40% of those replying had not heard of the guidance, 70% had not seen\na copy and 84% stated they had not been consulted on the setting up of local policies.52 Bill\nWalsh of MSF was quoted in the Health Service Journal as finding the results \"very\ndisturbing\".53\nAlthough concerns have been expressed that the guidance does not offer adequate protection\nin cases where staff members see no alternative to making their concerns public, the aim of\nfostering openness in the NHS has general support. Christine Hancock, the general secretary\nof the Royal College of Nursing, for example, commented in the Health Service Journal54 that\nwhere health services encouraged openness about professional concerns, then \"over the long\nterm, this would make almost all whistle-blowing unnecessary\". She also commented on the\nimportance of clinical audit and peer review in maintaining and raising standards, and pointed\nout that nurses are in fact bound by their professional code to speak out when they feel\nstandards of care are threatened. One example of an NHS trust introducing a clear policy on\nwhat could be called internal whistleblowing is the Northwick Park NHS Trust, which\nrecently launched a \"whistle-blower's charter\" for all staff. As well as encouraging both\ninformal and formal approaches to an individual's line manager, the charter also states that\na team of eight people from the Trust's ethics committee would be available to offer support\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n49 Department of Health press notice 92/331, 16 October 1992\n50\n\"Guidelines for whistle blowers are 'toothless'\", Health Service Journal, 17 June 1993 p.7\n51\n\"Press 'gag' on health staff\", The Guardian, 10 June 1993 p.9\n52 MSF, \"Freedom of speech in the NHS - MSF Survey Results\", 1994\n53\n\"DoH advice fails to allay fears of 'whistle-blowing'\", Health Service Journal, 12 May 1994 p.6\n54\n\"Whistle while you work\", Health Service Journal, 14 September 1994 p.23\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nto any member of staff, and that staff approaching this team would be guaranteed\nconfidentiality.55\nThe Department of Health has also recently proposed that the duty to take action where a\ncolleague's performance is poor should be specifically included within doctors' terms and\nconditions of service. Currently, this duty is set out in guidance on good professional practice\nfrom the General Medical Council,56 but is not included within employment contracts. The\nproposal was made by a review group set up by the Department of Health in 1993 after an\ninterim report on tumour diagnosis in South Birmingham showed that colleagues had been\naware for some time of misdiagnoses by the pathologist, Dr Carol Starkie, but had failed to\nact on their suspicions.57 The review group's report58 was published in August 1995; its\nrecommendations also included inviting the British Medical Association to set up a national\nhelpline to provide confidential anonymous advice on poor medical performance, and\ninvestigating the feasibility of setting up \"mentoring\" systems for all hospital medical staff\nto lessen professional isolation.\nIX Disclosure of Sources\nSection 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 provides that\nNo court may require a person to disclose, nor is any person guilty of\ncontempt of court for refusing to disclose, the source of information\ncontained in a publication for which he is responsible, unless it be\nestablished to the satisfaction of the court that disclosure is necessary in the\ninterests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or\ncrime.\nClause 8 of the Public Interest Disclosure Bill would remove the \"interests of justice\"\nrequirement in a case where the information referred to was subject to an obligation of\nconfidentiality, and the court was satisfied that, notwithstanding any such claim, its\npublication was in the public interest.\nThis is to be distinguished from what is merely of interest to the public. The Press\nComplaints Commission's Code of Practice creates exceptions to rules about, for example,\ninvasion of privacy or obtaining of information by subterfuge, which may be covered by\ninvoking the public interest and for the purposes of the code this is defined as\n Detecting or exposing crime or a serious misdemeanour\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n55\n\"Whistle while you work\", Nursing Times, 20 September 1995 p.18\n56 GMC, \"Duties of a doctor\", 1995\n57 Department of Health press notices 93/932, 26 August 1993 & 95/398, 7 August 1995\n58 Department of Health, \"Maintaining medical excellence\", 1995\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\n Protecting public health and safety\n Preventing the public from being misled by some statement or action of an individual\nor organisation.\nClause 7 of the NUJ Code of Conduct states that \"A journalist shall protect confidential\nsources of information\", and s.10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 establishes a\npresumption in favour of journalists who wish to protect their sources, unless the court\ndecides that disclosure is required on one of the four grounds identified.\nThe first of these: \"in the interests of justice\" is the most open to interpretation. It was\ndiscussed by Lord Bridge in X Ltd v Morgan Grampian Ltd:59\nBut the question whether disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice\ngives rise to a more difficult problem of weighing one public interest against\nanother. A question arising under this part of s 10 has not previously come\nbefore your Lordships' House for decision. In discussing the section\ngenerally Lord Diplock said in Secretary of State for Defence v Guardian\nNewspapers Ltd [1984] 3 All ER 601 at 607, [1985] AC 339 at 350:\n'The exceptions include no reference to \"the public\ninterest\" generally and I would add that in my view the\nexpression \"justice\", the interests of which are entitled to\nprotection, is not used in a general sense as the antonym\nof \"injustice\" but in the technical sense of the\nadministration of justice in the course of legal proceedings\nin a court of law, or, by reason of the extended definition\nof \"court\" in s 19 of the 1981 Act before a tribunal or\nbody exercising the judicial power of the state.'\nI agree entirely with the first half of this dictum. To construe 'justice' as the\nantonym of 'injustice' in s 10 would be far too wide. But to confine it to\n'the technical sense of the administration of justice in the course of legal\nproceedings in a court of law' seems to me, with all respect due to any\ndictum of Lord Diplock, to be too narrow. It is, in my opinion, 'in the\ninterests of justice', in the sense in which this phrase is used in s 10, that\npersons should be enabled to exercise important legal rights and to protect\nthemselves from serious legal wrongs whether or not resort to legal\nproceedings in a court of law will be necessary to attain these objectives.\nThus, to take a very obvious example, if an employer of a large staff is\nsuffering grave damage from the activities of an unidentified disloyal\nservant, it is undoubtedly in the interests of justice that he should be able to\nidentify him in order to terminate his contract of employment,\nnotwithstanding that no legal proceedings may be necessary to achieve that\nend.\nConstruing the phrase 'in the interests of justice' in this sense\nimmediately emphasises the importance of the balancing exercise. It will not\nbe sufficient, per se, for a party seeking disclosure of a source protected by\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n59 [1990] 2 All ER p.8\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\ns 10 to show merely that he will be unable without disclosure to exercise the\nlegal right or avert the threatened legal wrong on which he bases his claim\nin order to establish the necessity of disclosure. The judge's task will\nalways be to weigh in the scales the importance of enabling the ends of\njustice to be attained in the circumstances of the particular case on the one\nhand against the importance of protecting the source on the other hand. In\nthis balancing exercise it is only if the judge is satisfied that disclosure in\nthe interests of justice is of such preponderating importance as to override\nthe statutory privilege against disclosure that the threshold of necessity will\nbe reached.\nThis was the case involving the journalist William Goodwin who in 1989 was telephoned by\na source which gave him information about the financial status of a company, X Ltd, which\nhe proposed to use in an article for publication in The Engineer.\nHaving been approached by Mr Goodwin to check the unsolicited information he had been\ngiven, the company concluded that the information was derived from a draft of their\nconfidential corporate plan. On 7 November 1989 they applied for and obtained an ex parte\ninterim injunction to restrain the publishers of The Engineer from publishing any article\nincluding material derived from the corporate plan. An order was obtained that the publishers\nshould disclose the applicant's notes which would enable identification to be made of his\nsource. On 22 November 1989, Mr Justice Hoffman stated that it was necessary \"in the\ninterests of justice\" for the source's identity to be disclosed to enable X Ltd to bring\nproceedings against the source. He was satisfied that there was prima facie evidence that X\nLtd had suffered a serious wrong by the theft of its confidential file, and that it would suffer\ncommercial damage if the information was disclosed. \nIn December 1989 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal against the disclosure order, as\ndid the House of Lords on 4 April 1990: \"They found that the necessity for disclosure in the\ninterests of justice was established. They considered that the importance to X Ltd of\nobtaining disclosure to obviate the threat of severe danger to their business and consequently\nto the livelihood of their employees, outweighed the importance of protecting the source.\nThey had regard in this balancing exercise to their deductions that the source had at the very\nleast committed a gross breach of confidentiality and also to their assessment of the lack of\npressing public interest in publication of the information.\"60\nIn September 1990 Mr Goodwin appealed to the Court of Human Rights that the disclosure\norder constituted an interference with his freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 of\nthe European Convention. The Commission in its report of 1 March 1994 expressed the\nopinion by 11 votes to 6 that there had been violation of this provision. The judgment of the\nCourt is awaited. Mr Goodwin contends that the disclosure order breached his duty of\nconfidentiality to his source and that the law permitting such orders, particularly the criterion\nof the \"interests of justice\" is not formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual\nto foresee with reasonable certainty when it will be applied, and casts a 'disproportionate\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n60 Human Rights Case Digest: Goodwin v UK, September-October 1993, p.227 \n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nchilling effect on the free flow of information to the public.\"61 The Government, while\nrecognising that s.10 provides a strong presumption against ordering disclosure, submitted that\ninterference was necessary in a democratic society for the purpose of protecting the rights of\nothers and for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence. The\nIndependent 24th April 1995, reported that the Government had drafted a caution which\njournalists should deliver before accepting information from a source. It was reported to read\nas follows:62\n'You have my word that I will not under any circumstances divulge your\nidentity unless I am ordered to do so by a court, and I will resist any\nattempt by the court to impose an order on me. 'But you and I have to\nrecognise that there are occasions - historically they have been very few -\nwhen the court may make an order against me in the interests of national\nsecurity, to prevent disorder or crime, or when the interests of justice require\nit. We are, of course, neither of us, above the law, but the courts can be\nexpected to lean over backwards to preserve confidentiality if at all\npracticable.'\nGeoffrey Robertson QC, who acted for Mr Goodwin, is critical of the approach taken by the\ncourts in interpreting s.10: \"The case illustrates how the judicial value accorded to property\nrights will tend to prevail over ethical claims by the journalists in balancing exercises that\nrequire a subjective appreciation of competing public interests\".63 The authors comment: \"The\ncase of Bill Goodwin demonstrates that s.10 will not afford any real protection to journalists\nuntil it is amended to exclude the \"interests of justice\" exception......An alternative reform\nwould be to confine the exception to \"the interests of criminal justice\" which would confine\ndisclosure to cases where it was necessary to establish guilt or innocence at a criminal trial\". 64\n  \nX Legislation Abroad\nIn the USA, statutory protection for whistleblowers was first provided by the Civil Service\nReform Act of 1978. The act was designed to encourage disclosure of fraud, waste or abuse\nby providing protection from reprisal to employees, former employees, or applicants who\nmade such disclosures. However, it was felt that the legislation had little impact and in 1989\nthe Whistleblower Protection Act was passed to strengthen whistleblower protection. The\n1989 Act established the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) as an independent agency\nresponsible for protecting federal employees, especially whistleblowers, from \"prohibited\npersonnel practices\"; for investigating complaints of whistleblower reprisal; and, when reprisal\nwas found, for initiating corrective and disciplinary actions. A report by the General\nAccounting Office in March 1993 found wide disparities in how the 19 agencies it reviewed\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n61 Ibid, p.227\n62\n\"Government drafts caution for 'Whistle blowers' to give sources\"\n63 Media Law, 3rd ed., 1992, p.201 with Andrew Nicol\n64 ibid. \n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\nhad implemented the statutes.65 Some agencies had informed their employees about\nwhistleblower protection rights but most had not. Many employees are not aware of the\nprotection available, and it is often difficult to find evidence that a particular \"prohibited\npersonnel action\" was the result of whistleblowing activity rather than some other cause.66\nA range of environmental protection Acts covering such things as clean air67, safe drinking\nwater68 and toxic substances69 provide protection from discharge or other discriminatory action\nby employers in retaliation for employees' good faith complaints about safety and health\nhazards in the workplace. They cover all private sector employees and are enforced by the\nWage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration.70\nSeveral states in the USA have their own whistleblower protection legislation. That in\nMichigan is unusual in that it covers private sector employees as well as the state's own\nemployees. On the other hand, protection is limited to cases where reports are made to a\npublic body. Thus, internal whistleblowing is left unprotected.71\nThere is also special legislation in the USA designed to encourage employees to report\nmalpractice in any case involving public contracts. In 1985, revisions were made to the False\nClaims Act 1863, to allow people who expose financial malpractice in industries contracting\nwith the government to receive substantial compensation based on a share of 15-30% of the\nsavings recouped by the federal government. Very large sums have been awarded under these\nprovisions. For example, in December 1992, Chester Walsh, an employee of General Electric,\nreceived $13.4 million after exposing a fraud involving US foreign military sales aid.72 More\nrecently, Frederick Copeland, a worker at Western Geared Systems, a subsidiary of the British\ncompany, Lucas Industries, was awarded $18 million after claiming that employees had\nfalsely certified work on gearboxes for fighter aircraft.73 Providing financial incentives to\nwhistleblowing has had some success in the US, but it also creates problems. Some\ncommentators believe that the rewards are now so large that the whistle should be blown on\nwhistleblowers themselves. It is feared that some employees may be deterred from raising\na concern internally at an early stage, in the hope of large financial gains later on.74\nA number of Australian states also have whistleblower protection legislation. In Western\nAustralia, only persons providing information to the Official Corruption Commission, and\ncovered by that Commission's jurisdiction, can be protected against reprisal.

They include:\n• 1987 - Herald of Free Enterprise capsizes off Zeebrugge. 193 people die. The inquiry\nfound that staff had warned middle management five times before the disaster about\nthe ferry sailing with its bow doors open and that a suggestion that lights should be\nfitted to the bridge to indicate whether the doors had been closed had been ignored.\n[Sheen Report on the loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise, Department of Transport,\n1987]\n• 1988 - Piper Alpha oil platform explodes 110 miles off the coast of Scotland. 167\npeople die. The inquiry found that workers did not want to put their jobs in jeopardy\nthrough raising a safety issue which might embarrass management. [Report of the\nPublic Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster, Department of Energy, November 1990.\nCm 1310]\n• 1988 - Clapham rail crash. 35 people die. The inquiry found that a supervisor had\nnoticed the loose wiring a few months earlier but did nothing because he did not want\nto \"rock the boat\". [Hidden Report of the Investigation into the Clapham Junction\nRailway Accident, Department of Transport, 1989, Cm 820] \n• 1991 - BCCI collapse. The Bank of Credit and Commerce International closed as a\nresult of a 19 year old fraud causing estimated losses of over £2 billion world-wide.\nThe inquiry found that BCCI had an \"autocratic\" environment in which no-one dared\nto speak up. [Bingham Report on the Supervision of the Bank of Credit and\nCommerce International, HC 198 1992/93]\n• 1992 - Ashworth Hospital scandal. The inquiry into a brutal three year regime of\nphysical and mental abuse at a special hospital found that the few staff who had been\nbrave enough to speak out were attacked, received death threats and their property\nvandalised. [Blom-Cooper Report on Complaints about Ashworth Hospital,\nDepartment of Health, 1992, Cm 2028]\n• 1993 - Cancer misdiagnosis. 2,000 bone tumour cases had to be re-examined after an\ninquiry discovered that a senior pathologist at Birmingham's Royal Orthpaedic\nHospital had misdiagnosed 42 cancer cases. Two consultants had expressed doubts\nover the diagnoses over several years, but they had failed to speak up through official\nchannels. [Report on the errors in pathological diagnosis provided to the bone\ntumour service, Royal Orthopaedic Hospital 1985-1993, South Birmingham Health\nAuthority, 1993]\n33\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/26\n• 1993 - Lyme Bay Canoeing tragedy. 4 children drown. Some time before the\naccident, two instructors had written to the Head of the Centre warning that he should\nhave a careful look at safety standards or children might die.

Its main purpose is to\nenable local authorities to make cash payments to individuals in order to give the recipients\ncontrol over the money spent on meeting their community care needs. At the moment local\nauthorities have powers and duties to provide community care services but in England and\nWales they are expressly forbidden by several statutes from providing cash for such purposes.\nCash payments are in general provided through the national social security system. \nCommunity care services are for adults only. Social services departments can make cash\npayments for the benefit of children, services for whom are covered by separate legislation,\nbut even then cash is mostly to be provided in exceptional circumstances. There is also\nprovision for Scottish Social Work Departments (the equivalent of Social Services\nDepartments in England and Wales) to provide cash for adults in certain circumstances but\nagain this is restricted in that it is for emergencies only. In practice many local authorities in\nEngland and Wales have found ways round the cash ban but due to fears about the legality\nof such payments, they are nearly all indirect rather than direct payments, that is they are\nmade through third parties; and there have been fears that even some of the third party\nschemes may be illegal. \nDirect payments have therefore been described as a completely new way to deliver\ncommunity care. For example, speaking about the introduction of direct payments during the\npassage of the Bill through the House of Lords, Lady Cumberlege, Minister for Health, said:\n\"It is radically different from the way local authorities currently arrange community care\nservices. In many respects it is far more revolutionary than were the community care reforms\nthat we introduced in 1993.\"1\nThe starting point of the Bill is a local authority's assessment of an adult's community care\nneeds. If it appears to the local authority that someone needs services - whether it be\nsomeone to provide personal assistance, an adaptation, special equipment, or any other service\nwhich the authority might provide - it has a duty under the NHS and Community Care Act\n1990 section 47 (and related legislation) to assess his or her needs. If it concludes that the\nperson does need services, then it can either provide those services itself or buy them on\nbehalf of the individual from another agency. Under the Bill, the local authority will also have\nthe option, in certain circumstances and within existing resources, to make direct payments\nto enable individuals to buy the services themselves. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 HL Deb 12 February 1996 c424\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nThe principle of direct payments for helping disabled disabled people control their own lives\nhas corss party support and is backed by a variety of organisations. In particular, the\nDisablement Income Group and the British Council of Organisations of Disabled People,\nwhich consists of 50 organisations representing disabled people, have both been campaigning\nfor direct payments for some years. The principle is also supported by the local authority\nassociations and the Association of Directors of Social Services. \nIn spite of wide support for the principle, there are concerns about the way that direct\npayments will, or might,be implemented. The question of who will be eligible to receive\ndirect payments has been particularly controversial as the Government has suggested that\nregulations may exclude people over 65 and those with learning disabilities - at least initially.\nThere were two Divisions on this issue during the Bill's passage through the House of Lords\nas well as one on the issue of means-testing. The Government view prevailed on all of these\nand amendments on other controversial issues were withdrawn or not moved with the result\nthat the Bill was sent to the Commons with no amendments other than technical Government\nones.\nThe question of support services, particularly for disabled people embarking on employing\npersonal assistants, has also been controversial. The Government has said that it will issue\nguidance to local authorities to encourage them to provide such services but some groups\nwould like a stronger commitment to the provision of support. Other issues include the\nquestion whether local authorities should be required, rather than permitted, to provide direct\npayments where there is the demand and it is reasonable; whether the proposed exclusion of\nfamily members as employees goes too far; whether personal assistant and/or care agencies\nshould be regulated; and whether resources are adequate or some money should be ring-fenced\nfor direct payments.\nThe Bill contains three clauses covering the provisions relating to England and Wales, two\nclauses for Scotland, one for an Order in Council to bring the provisions into effect in\nNorthern Ireland, and a seventh, general clause. Much of the detail will be set out in guidance\nand regulations. Some indication of the Government's thinking on the details is evident from\nstatements made during the passage of the Bill in the House of Lords and in the consultation\npaper, Community Care (Direct Payments) Bill, published in January this year. Views had to\nbe submitted by February 23 - the end of the week in which the Bill was sent to the House\nof Commons. \n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nII Background \nA. Cash For Care: Existing \"Direct Payments\" \nHow will direct payments fit into existing provision? Local authority social services\ndepartments are mainly responsible for providing services and, in England and Wales, are\nspecifically forbidden from providing cash for community care services. On this point,\ngovernment guidance issued in 1990 said that:\n\"It may be possible for some service users to play a more active part in their own care\nmanagement, for example, assuming responsibility for the day to day management of their\ncarers may help to meet the aspirations of severely physically disabled people to be as\nindependent as possible. In these circumstances systems of accountability will have to be\nclearly defined. Authorities are reminded that Section 29 of the 1948 Act and Schedule 8 to\nthe 1977 Act, as well as Section 45 of the 1968 Act prohibit the making of cash payments in\nplace of arranging service.\"2 \nCash payments by social services departments for the benefit of children are not included\nunder this ban but they are mostly for exceptional circumstances. For example, the Children\nAct section 17, which places a duty on local authorities to provide services for children in\nneed, includes among its subsections the provision that: \"the services provided by a local\nauthority in the exercise of functions conferred on them by this section may include giving\nassistance in kind or, in exceptional circumstances, in cash.\" 3 The Adoption Allowances\nRegulations 19914 also indicate that such allowances are only for special cases although there\nis not the same kind of restriction in the case of fostering allowances.5\nThe situation in Scotland is slightly different in that payments may be made to adults but the\ncircumstances in which this can be done are tightly defined. A recent Written Answer from\nLord Lindsay, Minister for Scotland in the House of Lords, said that: \"Section 12 of the\nSocial Work (Scotland) Act 1968 provides for a local authority to give cash to, or in respect\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n2 Community Care In The Next Decade And Beyond, HMSO 1990 Para 3.17. The legislation referred to is the\nNational Assistance Act 1948 (welfare of disabled), the National Health Service Act 1977 (care of mothers &\nyoung children and prevention of illness & aftercare), and the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968\n(welfare of old people).\n3 This provision relates to England and Wales but there is a similar provision in the Children (Scotland) Act 1995\nsection 22.\n4 SI 1991/2030 & amending SI 1991/2130\n5 The legislative authority for these is contained in Section 23 (2) of the Children Act. A provision in Schedule\n1 paragraph 15 of the Children Act also empowers a local authority to make payments where the child is living\nwith someone as the result of a residence order (as long as the person with whom the child lives is not a parent\nof the child or the husband or wife of a parent of the child).\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nof, any person aged at least 18 years who is in need, within the meaning of the Act, and\nrequiring assistance in exceptional circumstances constituting an emergency, and where to\ndo so would be more cost effective.\"6 \nThere are two main ways in which governments have made explicit provision for regular and\ndirect payments for adults 1. through the social security system and 2. through the\nIndependent Living Fund:\n1. The social security system 7\nRelative to the way that social services are provided, the social security system is a highly\nregulated one with national rules that allow little discretion. Receipt of weekly payments is\ngenerally based on entitlement subject to specified conditions and, where there is\ndisagreement as to whether the conditions have been fulfilled, individuals can challenge the\ndecisions of officials at a tribunal and ultimately in the courts. Although benefits may be\ndesigned for specific purposes, eg Child Benefit for the costs of a child, there is generally no\nrequirement that claimants spend the benefits for such purposes.8 \nIn contrast, local authority social services departments, though subject to some government\nguidance and regulations, have more discretion in the way that they apply national policies.\nThe emphasis in legislation is on the duties and powers of the local authority to provide social\nservices rather than on the entitlement of individuals in defined circumstances. There is no\nsystem of tribunals although local authorities must have complaints procedures and can be\nchallenged in the courts by judicial review if they act unreasonably. \nMany of the social security benefits specifically for disabled people were developed during\nthe 1970s and there is now a range of such benefits. In theory these and any other benefits\npayable to disabled people could be used to buy services of a kind more commonly provided\nor arranged by local authorities. But a report on the economic problems of disabled people\npublished by the Policy Studies Institute (PSI), which synthesised the results of various\nstudies, including the national surveys of disability conducted by the Office of Population\nCensuses and Surveys in 1985-88, concluded that most disabled people could not contemplate\ndirectly paid for assistance for the simple reason that they did not have the money. It reported\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n6 HL Deb 25 January 1995 c81W\n7 Details of benefits for disabled people are contained in Department of Social Security leaflets. The Disability\nAlliance also produces an annual, Disability Rights Handbook which provide a guide to rights, benefits and\nservices for disabled people and their families.\n8 There are exceptions, in particular where deductions are being made for certain purposes such as arrears on fuel\nbills. \n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nthat only 4% of disabled people in the OPCS survey said that they were paying privately for\ndomestic services or nursing.9\nTwo benefits in particular appear to be designed for care needs: the Attendance Allowance\nand the care component of the Disability Living Allowance (which also has a component for\nmobility needs). The former is payable to people aged over 65, and the latter is for people\nunder 65. The test of entitlement is related to the need for practical support with daily living\nbut there is no requirement that the money be spent in any particular way. The PSI study\ncommented:\n\"It has never been clearly stated what the attendance allowance was for. A common\nassumption is that it was designed as a payment towards the costs of assistance with daily\nliving. An alternative assumption is that it was intended to pay for the extra expenditures\nfaced by many disabled people, and that the attendance criterion is simply used as an indicator\nof the extent of disability. In that light, the attendance allowance was no different from, say\nchild benefit, which recognises the additional costs of family life without having any particular\nitems of expenditure in mind.\"10\nIn 1995/96 the Attendance Allowance is worth £46.70 or £31. 30 a week depending on the\nlevel of need. The DLA care component is payable at these two rates and has a third lower\nrate of £12.40. The benefits are tax free; they are not means-tested themselves and do not\ncount as income for the purpose of other means-tested benefits. A severely disabled person\nreceiving Income Support and one of these benefits could receive up to around £180 a week\nplus housing costs. But the PSI study, reporting research into ways in which the Attendance\nAllowance was spent, said that majority of claimants used it as a general contribution to the\nbasic cost of living and did not feel that there was enough to pay for assistance.11 \nThere is also a benefit for carers, known as Invalid Care Allowance, and a higher rate of\nIncome Support is payable to certain carers. Whatever the merits or drawbacks of the carers\nbenefits, they do not embody the same principle as direct payments do as they are aimed at\nthe carer rather than at giving the disabled person direct control. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n9 The Economic Problems of Disabled People, Richard Berthoud et al.

The Independent Living Fund12\nThe Independent Living Fund is national charity which makes regular cash payments to\nindividuals enabling them to buy in personal (as opposed to nursing) care to meet their\nneeds. The case for direct payments has often drawn on the experience of the ILF and many\nof the current arguments, eg about eligibility, refer back to it. It is therefore described here\nin some detail and further information is available from the works cited.\nThe ILF rose from the ashes of a social security benefit which was for use as a payment\ntowards domestic assistance: the Supplementary Benefit (SB) addition for domestic\nassistance, which was abolished when SB was tranformed into Income Support in 1988. SB\nclaimants had been, subject to certain qualifying conditions, entitled to various additions to\nthe basic weekly benefit. These included help with laundry, heating, nursing needs and\ndomestic assistance. The domestic assistance addition was equal to the amount paid subject\nto the condition that the charge was reasonable and, in exceptional cases, eg where someone\nwas severely disabled, it could cover the cost of a permanent helper to live in, subject to a\nmaximum amount of £47.70 a week, plus an amount to cover employer's national insurance\ncontributions if necessary. \nMany of the conditions for these payments were related to disability. When the system\nchanged, these extra weekly amounts were consolidated into fixed weekly premiums and,\namong these is a disability premium (£19.80 a week in 1995-96) and a severe disability\npremium (£35.05 a week in 1995-96) which is payable in addition to the disability premium.\nAlthough many disabled claimants gained from the 1988 changes, some who would have\nreceived the highest amounts of money were expected to lose. \nThe ILF was therefore set up by the Government in co-operation with the Disablement\nIncome Group in order to help people in this position. Although it developed out of social\nsecurity changes and is financed by central government, it is an independent trust fund. It\nwas initially set up for five years but a revised version, called the ILF (1993) Fund, was set\nup in 1993 to work more closely with local authority social services departments.13 \nAt the time it was introduced, the ILF attracted criticism from Opposition MPs and from a\nnumber of groups representing disabled people who reportedly accused the Government of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12 For more details about the development of Independent Living Funds, see Library Research Paper 93/29, The\nDisability (Grants) Bill by Pat Strickland, 11 March 1993 and the Funds' annual reports.\n13 Those who were receiving payments at the time the first version of the ILF came to end continue to receive them\nfrom what is now the Independent Living (Extension) Fund.\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nabdicating their responsibilities.14 In practice, pressure of demand led the DSS to increase the\nFund's Budget from £5 million for the first year to £97 million by the final year. Payments\nfrom the Fund were at the discretion of the Trustees although there were eligibility criteria\nwhich, in spite of the increased budget, had to be tightened in order to keep demand in check.\nOriginally those who qualified for consideration had to receive Attendance Allowance; have\nresources at or below income support level; live alone or with someone unable to care for\nthem; be severely restricted in their ability to perform normal personal care or domestic tasks\nwithout extensive help; and be on income support or have income and capital below income\nsupport levels after they had met the costs of essential personal care and domestic help. Later,\npeople getting the lower rate of Attendance Allowance and people aged under 16 or over 75\nwere excluded. Over 75s were then readmitted although the trustees eventually limited awards\nto people receiving income support.\nSince it was revised in 1993, the ILF, now known as the ILF (1993) fund, is primarily for\ntopping-up local authority services to people living in their own homes where the services\nwould otherwise exceed the cost of residential care. In many respects it is similar to the old\nFund. For example, it is government funded; has eligibility criteria; payments are made at\nthe discretion of the trustees and the payments are not treated as income for means-tested\nbenefit purposes. There are differences nevertheless. In particular access now requires local\nauthority support; the budget is smaller at £17.3 million in 1995/96; and the criteria are on\nthe whole more restrictive.15 All the following have to be met: \nAge be at least 16 and under 66 years of age\nDisability receive the highest rate of the care component of the Disability\nLiving Allowance\nbe able of independent living in the community for at least the next\nsix months\nDomestic live alone or with people who are unable to provide all the care \nCircumstances needed\nIncome & Resources have savings of less than £8,000; and \nhave an income that is insufficient to cover the cost of the care\nneeded\nLA Involvement be assessed by the LA as being at risk of entering residential care or\nas being capable of leaving it to live in the community; and\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 Charities split over £5m to help severely disabled, Independent 10 February 1988; Government's new trust for\ndisabled, New Society, 12 February 1988.\n15 The Budget of the ILF (Extension) Fund (ie the one that continues payments to those who were getting payments\nfrom the original ILF when it closed) is £93.4 million. \n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nreceive at least £200 worth of services per week from the LA (net of\ncharges made to the applicant); and\nbe assessed as needing additional care but only to the extent that the\ncombined value of contributions from the LA and the Fund would not\nexceed £500 a week\nIf a local authority agrees to provide services to a minimum value of £200 a week, the Fund\ncan consider making cash payments of up to £300 a week directly to the disabled person. The\ncombined value of the local authority services and the payments from the (1993) Fund must\nnot exceed £500 a week. An award must be used to employ one or more people as care\nassistants and cannot be used for other purposes.16\nB. Pressure For Change\n1. Development of local authority schemes\nThe Disablement Income Group (DIG), which was instrumental in setting up the Independent\nLiving Fund, describes the early days of local authority cash payments for independent living\nas follows :\n\"At the beginning of the 1980s, a handful of disabled people persuaded their local authority\nto enable them to move out of the residential home they had been living in and into their own\nhomes. This was achieved by the local authority transferring funding from the residential\nhome to individual disabled people. In 1983 the people involved set up a Centre for\nIndependent Living in order to share their experiences with other disabled people. This\nmarked the beginning of a process which has steadily gained momentum.\"17\nA report on the development of payment schemes published in 1994 by the British Council\nof Organisations of Disabled People and the Policy Studies Institute (BCODP)18 found that\n60% of local authorities who responded to their questionnaire were operating some sort of\npayments scheme. However, nearly all of the schemes involved indirect payments, some\nauthorities having changed from direct to indirect payments after the government guidance\nwas issued in 1990.19 Taking account of the fact that there was no information about the\nauthorities that did not reply, that still meant that at least 38% of all authorities in Great\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n16 Budget figures from the annual report and eligibility criteria from the ILF's guidance notes to local authorities.\n17 Personal Assistance Support Schemes And The Introduction Of Direct Payments, Disablement Income Group,\nFebruary 1996 page 3.\n18 Cashing In On Independence: comparing the costs and benefits of cash and services by Gery Zarb and Pamela\nNadash, Policy Studies Institute for the British Council of Organisations of Disabled People, 1994.\n19 See reference 2 above.\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nBritain were operating a payments scheme. Of those who responded, 90% said that they\nwould make direct payments if legislation permitted.\nAs well as the postal suvey of local authorities, the BCODP/PSI study interviewed 70\ndisabled people about their experiences of services and payments. The report concluded that\npayments clearly offered disabled people a greater degree of choice and control. In particular\ndisabled people valued the fact that, compared with services, the assistance that they bought\nthemselves was more reliable and met a wider range of assistance needs. Users of social\nservices found it harder to get people at the time they needed them and to obtain back-up\nwhen the regular support was not available. The report also quoted an earlier survey of Social\nServices Directors which found that more than half of local authorities could only provide\nrestricted services at weekends and a quarter could not provide any night time cover at all.20\nAs far as costs were concerned, the hourly cost of assistance through direct payments was\n30% to 40% lower than the equivalent through social services. The main factor accounting\nfor the difference was the higher administrative cost of the latter. Against this positive finding\nhad to be set some negative factors. In particular, there was considerable variation in the\namount of support and advice for people to employ their own assistants and, although most\ndisabled people were judged to be acting as responsible employers, for some personal\nassistants, employment conditions were \"less than ideal\". The report favoured the provision\nof support services for those employing their own assistants both in order to rectify this\nproblem and to ensure greater efficiency. However, it concluded that even when the extra\ncosts of these support arrangements were taken into account, local payments schemes were\ncheaper than services. \nThis report is one of many that have come out of the disability movement in favour of direct\npayments by local authorities. Another of these, published by DIG, also provides information\nabout the development of local authority schemes but from a different angle. It examined the\nuses to which the Independent Living Transfer (ILT) had been put.21 The ILT was money\nwhich local authorities received from central government as a consequence of the changes to\nthe Independent Living Fund, \"to enable them to play a full part in meeting the needs of\nseverely disabled people.\"22 It was paid to local authorities in the three years from 1993/94\nto 1995/96, rising from £26 million in the first year to £100 million in the last. From 1996/7\nit will no longer be a separately identified amount of money. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n20 Causes For Concern: What Directors of Social Services Think AboutThe Impact Of Changes To The Independent\nLiving Fund, Pauline Thompson, Disablement Income Group 1993\n21 An Opportunity Lost? social services use of the Independent Living Transfer by Ann Kestenbaum, Disblement\nIncome Group 1995\n22 Virginia Bottomley, then Secretary of State for Health, HC Deb 26 November 1996 c809W\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nThe ILT has been paid to local authorities as part of the special grant for community care\nknown as the Special Transitional Grant (STG) which is ring-fenced for community care, that\nis local authorities have to spend it on community care services. The latter include residential\ncare as well as services for people living in their own home and the ILT was not separately\nring-fenced for any particular purpose within the community care grant although some, like\nDIG, argued that it should have been. \nThe DIG report concluded that although the ILT had been used by some authorities to provide\ndisabled people with cash so that they could employ their own care, its use varied greatly\nbetween authorities and some did not even treat it separately in their budgets. Overall, the\nreport concluded that in some authorities it had a significant impact on provision for disabled\npeople but in others it had none at all. It argued that the ILT should have been ring-fenced\nand that in future the central government allocation to local authorities should include a\nspecified amount for helping disabled people living at home to maximise choice and control\nover their own lives.\n2. Pressures inside Parliament\nThe pressure for change was also felt within Parliament. At the time of the passage of the\nNHS & Community Care Act 1990 through Parliament, Andrew Rowe (Conservative)\nattempted to bring in a new clause to legalise direct payments for care or personal assistance\nservices. He failed to obtain the unequivocal support of either Government or Opposition.23\nTwo years later he introduced a Ten Minute Rule Bill on the same issue but failed to secure\na Second Reading.24 \nThe next year Lord McColl introduced a bill with a similar purpose in the House of Lords\nwhich passed all its stages in the Lords but made no progress in the House of Commons.25\nHe argued that:\n\"For years a number of severely disabled people have received direct payments from local\nauthorities to allow them to buy and organise their own personal assistance services which\nenable them to preserve their dignity and independence and to live as normal a life as\npossible. When Westminster discovered this splendid arrangement during the Committee stage\nof the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, the congenital snag-hunters\nsoon went to work and the direct payments were declared illegal. It is high time that matter\nwas put right, and this Bill will do exactly that.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n23 SC E 22 February 1990 cc1223-1232\n24 The Disabled Persons (Services) Bill, HC Bill 44 of 1992/93.\n25 The Disabled Persons (Services) (No.2) Bill [HL]: Second Reading: 21 April 1993; Committee: 11 May 1993;\nThird Reading: 24 May 1995 of 1992\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nI wish to illustrate the problem by asking each of your Lordships to imagine yourselves as a\nperson who is so severely disabled that you are unable to get up in the morning without\nsomeone entering your home to help you. You are unable to get out of bed, to attend to your\ntoilet requirements or to dress yourself and do everything else that is necessary to get yourself\nready for a day's work. There are two ways of coping with this state of afffairs. The first way\nis to have the local authority provide you with a personal assistance service. You are not sure\nwhich assistant will arrive or the time she will arrive. The assistant may have been delayed\nwith another client and she could not arrive early enough to get you to work on time because\nlocal authority employment provisions prevent her from coming at the hours that you would\nprefer. Nevertheless you just have to put up with that.\nThe personal assistant who arrives may be the one you do not particularly like and she does\nnot appear to like you. Nevertheless she has to take you to the loo, wash you, dress you, get\nyou up and carry out all those intimate and personal tasks you would prefer to be able to do\nyourself. However, because of your physical disability you are unable to do so. There are\nother small tasks you would like to have carried out but that is not possible because they are\noutside the given remit. You are just one of many and even though you tell the assistant what\nyou want to have done, the assistant is an employee of the local authority and is ultimately\nresponsible to that authority and not to you. There is no doubt that you are not in control.\nThe other way of dealing with this problem is to receive direct payments from the local\nauthority to enable you to arrange your own care and to choose your personal assistant\nyourself. In fact, you could have two so that if one is unexpectedly ill and cannot come you\nhave another to call on. You know and like the person who is coming to get you up. If you\nwant another small task done you can just ask and it will be done. If you need to get up\nparticularly early one morning that can be arranged, Most important of all, you know that if\nthings do not work out, you can employ somebody else.\"26\nAt about the same time as Lord McColl's Bill was being debated in the House of Lords, the\nHealth Select Committee in the House of Commons was conducting an enquiry into the new\narrangements for community care under the NHS and Community Care Act 1990 which had\nbeen introduced in April 1993. The Committee's report, published in the summer of 1993,\nexamined the case for direct payments by local authorities and concluded that although it\nmight be necessary at that stage to avoid further disruption as the community care reforms\nsettled down, its members believed that the principle of giving some users the financial\nresources to purchase their own services merited investigation. It recommended that the\nGovernment review existing research and carry out further study if necessary.27\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n26 HL Deb1 April 1993 cc1640-1\n27 Community Care: The Way Forward, Health Committee, HC482 -1 of 1992/93 pp xv-vi\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nC. Government Response  \n1. Arguments Against Direct Payments \nAt the time of the passage of the NHS & Community Care Bill through Parliament, the\nGovernment initially responded to Andrew Rowe's proposed new clause by listing some of\nthe problems but offered to consider bringing in an amendment at a later stage. Virginia\nBottomley, then Secretary of State for Health, said:\n\"If this form of payment were widely available, it would be difficult to decide in some\ncircumstances how widely available the payment should be. For example, with disabled people\nwho are mentally frail or mentally handicapped, it would be hard to decide, without being\nunduly paternalistic, at what point one should draw the line. One would not want individual\nusers to have undue pressure put upon them, for instance by their relatives. There would also\nbe problems with the administrative burden, and with pricing and identifying the basic unit\ncost of the various elements of care. None of those reasons is sufficient for not considering\nthe amendment...\nWith my hon. Friend's agreement, I shall reconsider the proposal because the issue is complex.\nDetails need to be established, and it is possible that such a scheme cannot initially have the\nwidest possible availability. The basic commitment is there, and we may table a clearer and\nmore specific amendment when the Bill is in another place.\"28\nIn the end no amendment was forthcoming. Lady Hooper, then Minister for Health, said at\na later stage in the House of Lords that Ministers had reluctantly concluded that they were\nunable to introduce one. The difficulty hinged on \"the proper control of public expenditure\nand the need to ensure that the local authority is accountable for the expenditure that it\nmakes\".29 Soon after this statement, the Government issued the policy guidance which\nreminded local authorities that direct payments were illegal:30\n \nDuring the Second Reading debate on the McColl Bill, the Government's view was explained\nin more detail: Lady Cumberlege referred to research published by the Joseph Rowntree\nfoundation which showed that some disabled people resented the attitude of some social\nservice authorities which treated disabled people as recipients of charity but replied that if this\nwas so, then something was awry - not with the notion of statutory services, but with the way\nthat they were delivered. Independence for disabled people could be achieved without direct\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n28 SC E 22 February 1990 c1230.\n29 HL Deb 18 June 1990 c664\n30 See reference 2 above\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\npayments from local authorities. She also argued in favour of retaining separate roles for\nsocial services departments and the benefits system:\n\"Those are issues which the Community Care Act seeks to address. We fully support the aim\nof enabling disabled people to live independently and to exercise choice. We wish to give\nlocal authorities freedom and flexibility to meet those choices in innovative ways and to see\ndisabled people placed at the centre of decision making.\nThe new Act is based on the conviction that people who are receiving care are entitled to say\nwhat support they would like, and that those views are given the weight they deserve.\nPersonal assessment, which is the bedrock of the reforms, must be a joint exercise carried out\nby equal partners.\nBut the new arrangements for community care do not exist in a vacuum. Disabled people also\nhave long-standing rights under the social security system...\nThe Government are doing a great deal, both through reforms to social services provision and\nthrough the benefits system, to ensure that people receive the support and care they need to\nlive independent and fulfilled lives. That is rights and proper. But this support comes from\ntwo sources: local authority social services departments on the one hand and the social\nsecurity system on the other. Both have important roles to play and to a great extent they\nwork to the same end, supporting an individual in the community. However, they are different\nroles... It is the business of the social security system to provide cash to support individuals\nin need. It is not the business of local authorities. They are providers, enablers and facilitators\nof care services. It would be difficult for them to manage a general system of cash payments,\nincluding defining eligibility, and to carry out the necessary monitoring to keep control over\npublic funds.\nSocial services authorities do not work like the social security system. The concept of simply\ntrying to match a cash amount to a particular set of needs is at odds with the idea of a flexible\nresponse to individual circumstances. There is a real danger that all that would be achieved\nis the creation of a separate social security system within social services, with its\naccompanying rigidity. That in turn would restrict authorities' flexibility to meet local needs\nand their ability to obtain value for money for all the people they serve. The payment of cash\nto individuals is not a responsibility that we think it right to add to authorities' already very\nfull agendas.\nI hope I have made it quite clear, however, that we support the view that disabled people\nshould not be passive recipients of care but should be in control of decisions about their lives.\nThe new community care arrangements are designed to facilitate exactly that. There is no\nreason, for example, why disabled persons should not take on the day-to-day management of\ntheir carers if they wish to do so, or to help to choose them in the first place. Many already\ndo this and it could quite easily be written into contracts with care providers.\n... I do not doubt that in individual cases disabled people may be able to use money more\neffectively than certain authorities, but we need to look not only at the particular but at the\noverall effects of making direct payments part of the social services system. In our view there\nis a risk that over time they will led to a degree of inflexibility and will adversely affect\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nauthorities' availability to match their resources to all local needs, not just those of people\nreceiving direct payments.\n... It is important to distinguish between direct payments and care in the community. Of course\na disabled person who is supported to live in his or her own home is more independent than\nsomeone in residential care. But people can and do achieve that independence without the\nneed for direct cash payments.\"31\nOn Third Reading she announced \"with considerable regret\" that the Government could not\nsupport the Bill but did not seek to oppose it.32\nThe Government's response to the Health Committee report on community care referred to\nabove33 was given in September 1993. In this it continued to express doubts about the\nintroduction of direct payments to individuals in lieu of services and referred to the fact that\nthe new community care arrangements had only just been put in place but concluded:\n\"The Government is committed to continuing to examine the issue of direct payments and it\nwill give further careful consideration to the Committee's suggestions.\"\n2. Decision to introduce direct payments\nThe change of view was announced on 24 November 1994. In the Written Answer in which\nthe announcement was made, Virginia Bottomley, then Secretary of State for Health, also\nmade clear that the proposal would be more limited than some of its advocates would have\nwished. Eligibility would be restricted to a small group and the intended power would be\npermissive: \n\"I intend to take, in conjunction with my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for\nScotland and for Wales, a new power to enable social services authorities and social work\ndepartments to make direct cash payments to disabled people in lieu of community care\nservices. Direct payments are a logical extension of the citizen's charter. They will give\ndisabled people greater independence and choice and involve them and their carers more fully\nin their own care.\n\"This development will give disabled people greater independence and control over their lives.\nIt fully complements the other important measure which my hon. Friend the Minister for\nDisabled People is announcing. But, as a new departure, direct payments carry some risks. So\nin the short term we intend to limit those able to receive such payments to a relatively small\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n31 HL Deb 21 April 1993 cc1663-5\n32 HL Deb 24 May 1993 c81\n33 See reference 17 above\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\ngroup, probably those disabled people who are able and willing to manage their care. The\nintended power will also be permissive - authorities themselves will need to decide whether\nto take advantage of it, based on their judgement of whether it will help them make better use\nof their resources. Direct payments will be an alternative to community care services, where\nauthorities assess a need for them. There will be no overlap with social security benefits.\nThere are many complex issues to be resolved. We will be working with the key interests to\nmake sure the details are right. It would be unwise to introduce legislation before we are\nsatisfied that we have done so. We hope to move a Bill as soon as practicable.\"34\nA later Written Answer made clear that no additional resources would be provided35 and\nanother that a technical advisory group had been set up to consider the \"complex issues\" that\nremained to be resolved before legislation could be introduced.36\nA year after the original announcement, in the Queen's Speech on 15 November 1995, the\nGovernment announced that there would definitely be legislation in this Session of Parliament\nto enable local authorities to make payments to particular groups of people who want to\npurchase their own care.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n34 HC Deb 24 November 1994 c333W\n35 HC Deb 7 February 1995 c131W\n36 HC Deb 14 July 1995 c823W\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nIII The Bill\nA. The Contents of the Bill\nThe Community Care (Direct Payments) Bill [HL] was introduced in the House of Lords on\n16 November 1995 and arrived in the House of Commons as Bill 64 of 1995/96 with hardly\nany changes. Its main purpose is to enable local authorities to make cash payments to\nindividuals in order to give the recipients control over the money spent on meeting their\ncommunity care needs. These cash payments would be an optional alternative to the services\nwhich local authorities now provide.\nMany of the details of the provisions in the Bill are to filled in later by Regulations. The\nGovernment has already given some idea of its intentions, both in debates on the Bill and in\nthe Consultation Paper which was issued in January this year. These are described in the next\nsection. This section outlines the contents of the Bill as set out in the explanatory and\nfinancial memorandum:\nClause 1 empowers a local authority to pay an individual a sum to be used by him to make\nhis own arrangements to purchase care which would otherwise have been arranged by the\nauthority.\nSubsection (1) provides that, where a local authority has assessed an individual as needing\ncommunity care services, that authority has a discretion to pay him all or part of what it\nwould cost him to purchase any such services. This is subject to the individual being of a\ndescription specified in regulations by the Secretary of State and to the individual's consent.\nSubsection (2) provides that a local authority may have regard to the individual's financial\ncircumstances in determining the amount of direct payments.\nSubsection (3) provides that a local authority may not have regard to the financial\ncircumstances of an individual discharged from detention in a hospital in determining the\namount of a payment in respect of his after-care which would otherwise have been provided\nunder section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983.\nSubsections (2) and (3) create a framework for direct payments analogous to the existing\nsituation for those services arranged by the local authority.\nSubsection (4) allows the Secretary of State to specify in regulations categories of people who\nmay not be paid to provide a service using direct payments.\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nSubsection (5) empowers the Secretary of State to specify in regulations a maximum period\nfor which direct payments may be used to pay for residential accommodation.\nSubsection (6) empowers a local authority to recover all or part of a payment where the\nauthority is not satisfied that it has been used either to secure the service in respect of it\nwhich its made or in accordance with conditions upon its use.\nClause 2 enables an authority to arrange such care as might be necessary for the recipient of\ndirect payments where, by reason of emergency or otherwise, his own arrangements do not\nmeet his assessed needs. So long as the individual's arrangements are adequate then the local\nauthority making direct payments is under no obligation to arrange the service(s), for which\nthe payments substitute.\nClause 3 adds direct payments to the list of social services functions under the Local\nAuthority Social Services Act 1970, and so enables the Secretary of State to issue guidance\nand directions and to order an enquiry. It also ensures that direct payments recipients can have\nthe same access as service recipients to the complaints procedure under that Act.\nClause 4 empowers local authorities to make direct payments in Scotland, on a similar basis\nto that in England and Wales, by inserting new sections 12B & 12C into the Social Work\n(Scotland) Act 1968.37\nClause 6 provides that an Order in Council making corresponding provision for Northern\nIreland is to be subject to the negative resolution procedure.38\nFinancial Effects Of The Bill  The Bill will be implemented within existing resources. Local\nauthorities may decide whether or not to offer direct payments to individuals.\nEffect Of The Bill On Public Service Manpower The effect, if any, on public service\nmanpower will depend on the way in which local authorities implement the Bill. It is\nexpected that any effects will be small.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n37 Clause 5 contains a consequential amendment which is not described in the financial memorandum.\n38 There is also a Clause 7 which deals with the short title, commencement (on such day as the Secretary of State\nmay by statutory instrumenty appoint) and extent.\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nThe main change made during the Bill's passage through the House of Lords followed the\nrecommendation of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee. It had said that the provision\nto enable local authorities to recover payments that have been improperly spent should be\nwritten onto the face of the Bill whereas the original Bill was going to enable this power to\nbe made by Regulations. An equivalent change was made to the Scottish clause.\nAnother change is a new sub clause to make clear that, in England and Wales, payments\nmade instead of services that would have been provided for after-care under the Mental\nHealth Act 1983 section 117 are excluded from the provision that local authorities may have\nregard to the financial circumstances of someone to whom they make direct payments (as\nthey are currently excluded from the provision that local authorities may charge for local\nauthority services). As Scottish mental health legislation allows charging for after-care, the\nequivalent provision was not written into the Scottish clause.\nThere is also a new note in the explanatory memorandum (see the joint note on subclauses\n2 and 3 above) to say that the subclauses on means-testing create a framework analogous to\nthe existing situation for those services arranged by the local authority. The question whether\nthe provisions were analogous had been an issue during the debates on the Bill; because the\nwording is not the same as that contained in the existing legislation.39 The Opposition\nconsidered that the test for direct payments would be harsher and had put forward\namendments designed to put similar wording in place. The issue was pressed to a Division\non Report40 but it was defeated, the Government having argued that the amendment was not\nnecessary because the provisions were in fact analogous. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n39 Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act section 17, which gives local authorities a\ndiscretionary power to charge for services. \n40 HL Deb 12 February 1996 cc432-7\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nB. Commitments, Clarification and Consultation \n1. Commitments\nAt the end of the Third Reading in the House of Lords, Lady Cumberlege outlined the\ncommitments which the Government had given during the debates and these are summarised\nbelow41:\n• Report to Parliament: on the workings of the Act within three years of\ncommencement. \n• Means test: guidance to be issued to stress that local authorities must treat\npeople fairly, and should treat those receiving direct payments in a manner\nequivalent to those receiving services.\n• Adequacy of payments: guidance to be issued to make clear that payments\nshould be sufficient to allow people to buy services of adequate quality, taking\naccount of any legal liabilities involved in doing so. \n• Support for recipients: practice guidance to encourage local authorities to give\nsupport to people who receive direct payments. Local authorities to be told that\nbefore people consent to receive direct payments they should ensure that they\nare made aware that they may have responsibilities as employers.\n• Guide for people who receive direct payments: the government is thinking of\nproducing one. If produced, it would certainly cover the issue of employing\nstaff. The Technical Advisory Group has been asked to assist. \n• Training materials for local authorities: to be produced in order to help them\nto train their staff. Disabled people and local authorities to be involved in the\ndevelopment of this policy. The Technical Advisory Group has been asked to\nassist. \n• Draft guidance: Government to consult widely.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n41 HL Deb 20 February 1996 cc1044-5\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\n• Eligibility: to be kept under review once direct payments are available.\n2. Clarification and Consultation\nClarification of the Government's intentions is contained in the consultation paper, The\nCommunity Care (Direct Payments) Bill Consultation Paper, Department of Health, the\nScottish Office, Welsh Office, Northern Ireland Office, issued in January 1996 just before the\nCommittee Stage of the Bill in the House of Lords. Details of the consultation are\nsummarised below:\nThe Bill does not require local authorities to make direct payments. It is up to them to decide\nwhether to offer them but the person concerned must consent. Individuals cannot be obliged\nto have a direct payment instead of a service against their will.\nThe money must be spent on services to meet the need which the local authority has accepted\nand the local authority will be able to recover the money. \nThere is nothing in the Bill to stop someone else acting on the individual's behalf as his or\nher agent but the disabled recipient of the payment is ultimately responsible for the way that\nit is managed. \nRegulation-making powers in the Bill will be used to limit eligibility to a small group in the\nfirst instance :\"The Government is inclined to the view that, in the first instance, eligibility\nfor direct payments should be limited to adults under 65 years who are physically disabled\nand who are able and willing to manage direct payments, with help if necessary\" but other\ngroups might be considered, in particular adults under 65 with learning disabilities. Those who\nwould definitely be excluded were also listed, eg certain people subject to mental health or\ncriminal justice legislation.\nThe Bill contains no floor or ceiling on the level at which direct payments could be given but\nthe Government will spell out in guidance its view that direct payments should not be offered\nto an eligible person unless they are at least as cost effective as the services which the local\nauthority would otherwise arrange.\nThe Government intends to use the regulation-making power in the Bill to specify categories\nof people who may not be paid to provide a service using direct payments to prevent\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\npayments recipients from paying their spouse, partner or a close relative living in the same\nhousehold to provide a service. For this purpose the Government intends to use the following\ndefinition of a close relative: a parent, parent-in-law, aunt, uncle, grandparent, son daughter,\nson-in-law, daughter-in-law, step son or daughter, brother, sister or spouse or partner of any\nof the preceding. In addition, the Government intends to issue guidance to say that local\nauthorities should not make direct payments where the recipient intends to employ or contract\nwith close relatives who live elsewhere, or other people living in the same household (unless\nthey are people who were specifically recruited to be live-in personal assistants).\nLocal authorities will have discretion to make exceptions to the rules set out in this guidance\nin exceptional circumstances, where they are satisfied that it is not possible to find a suitable\nperson to provide care who does not fall into one of these categories. For example, the\nrecipient may live in a sparsely populated rural area, or may have cultural or religious reasons\nfor needing to employ only people from the same ethnic background. In certain areas, such\na person may only be available within the recipient's family.\nThe only community care service which people will not be able to buy using direct payments\nis permanent residential care but they will be able to purchase temporary residential care\n(respite care). The maximum period will be specified in regulations. The Government\nproposes to set this at four weeks in any 12 month period, which would avoid inconsistency\nwith certain social security benefits payable to people in residential care.\nRecovery of misspent money is to be a power of local authorities rather than a duty. This is\nso that they can be flexible and reasonable in handling individual cases, eg in cases of\nhardship where money has been mismanaged innocently.\nRecipients will be expected to make arrangements for cover in emergencies but ultimately the\nlocal authority still has a responsibility for emergency care.\nThe normal community care review process will apply to direct payments.\nUnder current legislation local authorities cannot sell services. People receiving direct\npayments will not be able to use them to purchase services from their local authorities\nalthough they can receive a mixture of local authority services and direct payments.\nExisting local authority complaints procedures will be applicable, eg for complaints about the\nlevel of the direct payment but not about the services purchased as these will not be the\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nresponsibility of the local authority. Nor will personal assistant employed by means of direct\npayments have access to the complaints procedures.\nAccess to the Independent Living Fund will continue as now regardless of whether the local\nauthority provides services or direct payments or a combination of the two.\nDirect payments will be disregarded for the purpose of income-related benefits and child\nsupport maintenance assessments. They will not be taxable and will not affect entitlement to\nlegal aid. They will not replace care provided by the NHS and are not available to meet\nhousing costs.\nThe consultation paper asked for views on any of the matters in the paper or related issues\nand asked in particular about three of the areas to be covered in regulations:\n• Who will be eligible to receive direct payments\n• Who can and cannot be employed and paid out of a direct payment\n• The maximum period of residential care for which direct payments can be used\nC. Issues And Responses To The Bill\nAlthough the Bill had cross party support in the House of Lords, there were some\ncontroversial issues. This section lists issues that have been raised both inside and outside\nParliament not only in relation to the Bill but also in relation to the proposed content of\nregulations and guidance. Some concerns depend to some extent on the time at which they\nwere expressed - many were expressed in briefing papers written for the Second Reading in\nthe House of Lords in December. At the time of writing (week ending 23 February), it is too\nsoon to quote results of the consultation exercise. \nSome of the original concerns have been answered by Government statements during debates\nin the Lords or in the material summarised in the previous section. For example, amendments\non the need for regulation of domiciliary care (see below) were withdrawn when the\nGovernment replied that a review of the way that social services is regulated and inspected\nwas currently under way. In some cases, whether the concerns were answered satisfactorily\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nwill depend on the eye of the beholder although many initial concerns that have now been\nclarified have not been repeated here. 42 \n• Eligibility : In the House of Lords the most outstanding issue was who would be eligible\nto receive direct payments. It was twice pressed to a Division both on Report and Third\nReading.43 It was also discussed in Committee.44 The reason was that many peers were\nopposed to the proposed exclusion of people over 65 and of those with learning disabilities.\nA \"compromise\" amendment would have allowed local authorities to make the decision rather\nthan to have the categories specified in Regulations. None of the proposed amendments was\nsuccessful. \nEligibility has also been a major issue among groups outside Parliament. Organisations\nopposed to restricting eligibility include the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), the Disability\nAlliance (DA), Age Concern, the British Council of Organisations of Disabled People\n(BCODP), and Scope whereas the Association of Metropolitan Authorities/ Association of\nCount Councils (AMA/ACC) welcomed the proposal to initially limit availability. DIG and\nthe Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) thought that it should be up to local\nauthorities to decide who would be eligible. Age Concern has said that it will not support\nthe Bill until the principle of older people being included has been accepted. \n• Need for support services: This has been another major issue. DIG lists it among its\nthree major concerns and has just produced two reports on the subject.45 The case has been\nmade for support services both in order to help disabled people become good employers and\nin order to make direct payments operate more efficiently. The Government has now made\nclear that it will be issuing guidance (see above section) but there are some who feel that\nsupport services should be required by legislation. DIG distinguishes between support\nservices which help the disabled person and \"third party\" schemes which simply administer\nthe payment on the disabled persons's behalf. DIG argues that direct payments will only reach\na fraction of those who could benefit if adequate support services are not available. It would\nprefer that a legal obligation should be placed on local authorities to ensure that support\navailable. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n42 The debates on the Bill in the House of Lords were on the following dates: Second Reading 7 December 1995;\nCommittee: 15 January 1996; Report: 12 February 1996; Third Reading: 20 February 1996. \n43 HL Deb 12 February 1996 cc420-427(Report) and 20 February 1996 c1031(Third Reading)\n44 HL Deb 15 January 1996 c 364-80\n45 Personal Assistance Support Schemes And The Introduction Of direct Payments, Disablement Income Group\nFebruary 1996; and Facilitating And Supporting Independent Living: a guide to setting up a personal assistance\nsupport scheme, Felicity Simpson with Jane Campbell, Disablement Income Group, February 1996\n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nOthers who are concerned that there should be some form of support for disabled people\ninclude the RCN, the DA, the BCODP, Scope the AMA/ACC and the ADSS although there\nare some differences of emphasis, for example over whether support should be provided\nthrough social services staff or independently. Some such as the ADSS and the BCDOP\nhave argued that there should be extra funding available for support purposes. The issues was\nraised in Committee, on Report and at Third Reading in the House of Lords.46 \n• Should local authorities be required to provide direct payments? The argument for\nrequiring local authorities to make direct payments where there is a demand for them and\nwhere it is reasonable has been made on grounds of equity. Some are concerned that the Bill's\nprovision simply to give local authorities discretionary power will result in unacceptable\nregional variations and that direct payments will not be portable if a disabled person moves\nfrom one authority to another. This is DIG's third major concern and it is supported by several\nother organisations such as Scope, the RCN and the DA. The RCN argues that there are\nalready unacceptable variations in community care services and the DA points to great\ninequalities in local authority charging policies at the moment. This issue was raised in the\nLords in Committee and on Report.47\n• Who can a direct payment recipient employ? There has been some concern that the\nproposed exclusion of family members from being employed out of direct payment money\ngoes too far.The BCODP, for example, argues that the rules should resemble those of the\nIndependent Living Fund and that it should be possible to employ a family member who does\nnot live in the same household. The issue was raised several times in the Lords.48\n• Regulation of personal assistants/care providers: The issue whether personal assistants\nand/or care agencies should be regulated in some way has also been raised in the context of\nthis Bill. Scope, for example, is concerned about the quality of service provision and what it\nconsiders to be inadequate vetting of personal assistance staff both in the public and private\nsectors. The AMA/ACC argues that empowerment through choice can only be a reality if\nproviders of services are regulated in the public interest to meet reasonable standards of\nquality and care. Similar the ADSS argues that registration and inspection of domiciliary care\nagencies should be introduced. The issue was raised in the House of Lords where the opposite\nview, that disabled people should be able to train their own personal assistants without\nintereference from public authorities, was also expressed.49 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n46 L Deb 15.1.96 cc384-91 and 12.2.96 cc452-456\n47 HL Deb 15 January 1996 cc391-4; 12 February 1996 cc429-432\n48 5 January 1996 cc406-415;12 February 1996 cc438-445; and 20 February cc1040-1043\n49 HL Deb 15 January 1996 cc453-456; 12 February 1996 cc458-464.\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/29\nOther issues raised include:\n• Adequacy of resources and/or ring-fencing for personal assistance (eg DA, Scope,\nAMA/ACC, ADSS)\n• The right to use direct payment to buy local authority services (eg AMA/ACC and\nADSS; HL Deb 15.1.96 cc415-42)\n \n• The length of time allowed for respite care (eg BCDOP ; HL Deb 15.1.96 cc418-20)\n• Regulations to use the affirmative rather than the negative procedure (the latter is\nproposed in the Bill) (HL Deb 12.2.96 cc468-70)\n29\n\n\n\n"

The results of its deliberation were published initially as a\nconsultative document (Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary\nConclusions, Department of the Environment, August 1994) and finally as a White Paper\n(Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Final Conclusions, Cm 2919, July 1995).\nThis paper seeks to outline some of the most topical issues.\nAn explanation of the different types of relevant radiation is given followed by an account\nof the current criteria for the classification of radioactive waste into four categories. High-\nlevel waste (HLW), intermediate -level waste (ILW) , low-level waste (LLW) and very low-\nlevel waste (VLLW). This classification is under review and may be refined to take account\nof half-life and type of radiation.\nAn account is included of the policy governing the storage and disposal of HLW and the\nreturn of such waste to the country of origin following reprocessing in the UK of spent\nforeign fuel.\nThe current position of the proposal by UK Nirex Ltd to build a repository for ILW and some\nLLW at Sellafield in Cumbria is outlined.\nFinally details of Government policy concerning the controlled burial of LLW at landfill sites\nis given.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\nPage\nI Introduction 7\nII Radioactivity 9\nA.

Friend the Minister for Energy, my Department will be heading\na separate but complementary review of radioactive waste management\npolicy.\nThe radioactive waste management review will examine current policy in the\nlight of changes which have taken place since the Department published its\nnational strategy in 19842. It will range wider than the nuclear industry-\ncovering radioactive waste management as a whole. It will not address the\nsuitability of specific sites, this being a matter for the planning and\nregulatory process, or the merits of the operations of existing nuclear power\nstations or those in the pipeline.\nThe Department proposes to publish its preliminary conclusions later in the\nsummer, as a basis for consultation.\nHer Majesty's inspectorate of pollution will also be issuing for consultation\na revision of the Department's 1994 publication \"Disposal facilities on land\nfor low and intermediate level Radioactive Wastes:principles for the\nprotection of the human environment\".\nIn parallel with this latter exercise, the Radioactive Waste Management\nAdvisory Committee on Safety at Nuclear Installations will be asked to\nconsider the approach to site selection for disposal facilities and the criteria\nfor ensuring the protection of human health. Further details will be\nannounced later.\nIn the decade that has elapsed since the Department of the Environment published its national\nstrategy for the long-term management of radioactive waste3 a number of important\ndevelopments have taken place. Two of these which made it particularly timely for the\nreview to be conducted were the Government's review of the nuclear industry4 and the\ncontinuing investigation into the disposal of intermediate and low level radioactive waste\n(ILW and LLW) in an underground repository at Sellafield by UK Nuclear Industry\nRadioactive Waste Management Executive (Nirex) Ltd. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of\nPollution's (HMIP) consultation on disposal facilities mentioned in the penultimate paragraph\nand the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee's (RWMAC) approach to\ndisposal site selection mentioned in the last paragraph of the announcement both pertain to\nthe activities of Nirex.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n1HC Deb 19 May 1994 c 535-6W\n2Radioactive Waste Management: the National Strategy, Dept of the Environment, July 1984\n3\n ibid\n4\n HC Deb 19 May 1994 c 543-4W\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/30\nThe outcome and conclusions of the radioactive waste review have direct implications for the\nproposal to privatise the majority of the nuclear industry, in particular the costs of\ndecommissioning nuclear power stations at the end of their production lives, the reprocessing\nof spent nuclear fuel and the disposal of radioactive waste produced by the stations both\nwhilst operating and upon decommissioning. \nThese issues led to the Government modifying its policy twice during its attempt to privatise\nthe electricity industry in its entirety in 1989. Initially it withdrew the older Magnox stations\nand their liabilities from the sale5:\n\"As a result of our preparations for privatisation, it has recently become\nclear that the cost of reprocessing and waste treatment of spent Magnox\nnuclear fuel will be a great deal higher than has been charged in electricity\nprices and provided for in the accounts of the Central Electricity Generating\nBoard and the South of Scotland Electricity Board. The Magnox stations\nare drawing to the end of their lives. One is already closed, and most of the\nothers are due to close within the next few years. Most of these costs\ntherefore relate to the past, to electricity already generated and paid for.\nFuture customers will be bearing the full cost of the electricity they\nconsume. It would not be right to burden them also with costs arising from\nthe past.....\n.....It has been decided that both the assets and the liabilities relating to the\nMagnox stations belonging to the CEGB and the SSEB should remain under\nGovernment control.\"\nSubsequently the more modern Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors (AGRs) and the UK's only\nPressurised Water Reactor (PWR), under construction at Sizewell B in Suffolk, were\nwithdrawn6.\nThe Government's current position following the White Paper7 on the nuclear industry is to\nprivatise the AGR and PWR stations together with their liabilities while the older Magnox\nstations with their liabilities remain in the public sector. These issues have been dealt with\nin two Library Research papers: The Nuclear Review (RP 94/31) and  Nuclear Privatisation\n(RP 96/3).\nDuring the course of the radioactive waste management review the Government issued its\npreliminary findings as a consultation document8 and its final deliberations as a White Paper9.\nSome topical issues from these will be outlined where appropriate in the remainder of this\npaper.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n5HC Deb 24 July 1989 c746\n6\n HC Deb 9 Nov 1989 c1171-79\n7\n The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK Cm 2860, May 1995\n8\n Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions.

Alpha, Beta and Gamma Rays\nIn this context there are three main types of radiation of concern, known as alpha (α), beta\n(β) and gamma (γ) rays. These are termed ionising radiation because they cause positively\nand negatively charged atoms or molecules, called ions, in the material through which they\npass. It is this ionisation which causes damage to biological tissue which is exposed to such\nradiation.\nAlpha (α) particles consist of two protons and two neutrons which is the form of the helium\nnucleus10. These particles penetrate only a short distance, typically a few centimetres in air,\nand are stopped by a sheet of plastic. They deposit all of their energy over this short distance\ncausing greater damage than more penetrating radiation of similar energy. Consequently α\nemitters are particularly damaging if inhaled or ingested.\nBeta (β) particles are electrons11 emitted from a nucleus which has an unstable configuration.\nThese typically travel further than α particles but are stopped within a few millimetres of skin.\nThey are less densely ionising than α particles and therefore less biologically damaging.\nGamma (γ)rays are electromagnetic rays, like light, and can be considered as non-particulate\nin nature. They are very penetrating, typically requiring a metre of concrete or water to stop\nthem. They interact with matter along their track causing ionisation but because of their great\nrange can pass right through the human body depositing very little of their energy along the\nway.\nB. Radioactive decay\nAn unstable nucleus (radionuclide) is transformed into a more stable state by the emission of\nradiation in a process called radioactive decay. The half-life is the time taken for half of any\ngiven amount of a radionuclide to decay. Each radionuclide has a characteristic half-life\nwhich is unalterable. Examples of interest in the nuclear industry are:\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n10\n A helium nucleus is the heavy central part of the helium atom\n11\n Electrons are elementary particles which are constituents of atoms\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/30\nRadionuclide Half-life\niodine-131 8 days\nplutonium-239 24,000 years\nuranium-238 4, 470 million years\nC. Units of Measurement\nThe unit of radioactivity is the becquerel (Bq). On Bq is one emission per second. The rate\nof emission is often very much greater than this so that measurements are frequently quoted\nin kilobecquerels (KBq=1000=103Bq), gigabecquerels (GBq=109Bq) or terabecquerels\n(TBq=1012Bq).\nActivity is not an indication of biological effect. As already mentioned some forms of\nradiation are more densely ionising than others. In addition there is variation in the body's\nuptake of particular radionuclides and their subsequent concentration in different parts of it.\nAlso different tissues in the body vary in their susceptibility to radiation damage. The\npotential harm, or dose, is measured in units called sieverts (Sv). A thousandth of a Sv or\nmillisievert (mSv) is a commonly encountered quantity.\nIII Waste Categories\nIn the UK radioactive waste is classified into four broad categories depending upon its heat-\ngenerating capacity and radioactivity.\nA. High Level Waste (HLW)  is waste in which significant amounts of heat are generated\nas a result of its radioactivity. It is also known as heat generating waste. The high\ntemperature has to be taken into account in designing storage and disposal facilities.\nEssentially HLW consists of the fission products of uranium and plutonium from spent fuel\nrods in the nitric acid in which they are dissolved during reprocessing. This type of waste\naccounts for 95% of the total radioactivity produced by the nuclear industry, although it is\nonly a small fraction of the total volume. In the last 30 years the nuclear industry has\nproduced a volume of HLW less than that of four double-decker buses. Reprocessing one\ntonne of spent nuclear fuel produces 0.1 cubic metres of HLW which contains approximately\n99% of the radioactivity in the spent fuel. The HLW in liquid form is concentrated by\nevaporation and stored inside double-walled stainless steel tanks inside thick concrete\nshielding walls. To dissipate heat, cooling coils operate within the tanks. There are several\nsets of these in case one fails. Such tanks have been used safely for more than 30 years but,\nto make the waste easier and safer to store, a vitrification plant has been built at Sellafield\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/30\nwhich turns the waste into dense solid glass blocks of   its liquid volume. Vitrified waste\nmay be stored before final disposal. Government policy12 is that this type of waste should\nbe stored for at least 50 years to allow it to cool. This is considered to be the most\nappropriate technical means for dealing with it and the strategy which best meets the\nGovernment's responsibility to future generations. The every-day management of HLW is the\nresponsibility of British Nuclear Fuels plc and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority\n(UKAEA).\nB. Intermediate-Level Waste (ILW) is waste in which insufficient heat is generated for\nthis to be a design requirement in storage or disposal facilities, but with activity levels above\nthat defined as the upper limit for low-level waste (LLW) (see below). This comprises mainly\ncladding from spent fuel rods, and structures from the core of decommissioned reactors which\nare contaminated with radioactivity. It also includes sludges arising from fuel reprocessing\nand plutonium contaminated materials. In volume terms the amount of ILW produced\nannually is about 10% of the LLW. Reprocessing 1 tonne of spent nuclear fuel produces 1\ncubic metre of ILW which contains about 1% of the spent fuel activity. At Sellafield there\nis a plant which seals this waste in cement within steel drums. This is then placed into a\nconcrete store above ground, but is destined for final disposal in a suitable repository, once\nbuilt (see later). The majority of ILW comes from the operation of the nuclear industry with\nother industries, hospitals, the Ministry of Defence and laboratories producing smaller\nquantities. ILW is currently stored at nuclear sites around the country awaiting the\nconstruction of a deep level radioactive waste repository. Responsibility for the disposal of\nILW (and some LLW) lies with Nirex.\nC. Low Level Waste (LLW) is waste which contains radioactive materials above the very\nlow level waste (VLLW) acceptable for disposal with ordinary refuse, but below 4GBq per\ntonne of α or 12GBq/tonne of β/γ activity. Such waste is diverse and includes paper towels,\nprotective clothing and laboratory equipment from areas where radioactive materials are\nhandled, and chemical sludges from the treatment of low level liquid. Between 25,000 and\n40,000 cubic metres of LLW are produced in Britain annually13. Reprocessing one tonne of\nspent fuel produces 4 cubic metres of LLW and contains 0.001% of its activity. The main\nsource of this waste is the nuclear industry although significant quantities come from\nhospitals, other industries and research establishments. Under existing authorizations LLW\ncan be accepted for disposal at BNFL's facility at Drigg in Cumbria or UKAEA's at Dounreay\nin Caithness.\nD. Very Low-Level wastes (VLLW) can be safely disposed of with ordinary refuse. Each\n0.1 cubic metre must contain less than 400 kBq of β/γ activity or single items must contain\nless than 40 kBq of β/γ activity.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n12\n HC Deb 1 February 1994 c 624W\n13\n Facts on Nirex UK Nirex Ltd 1993\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/30\nIV. Reclassification of Waste \nThe Government is currently considering the present categorisation of radioactive waste. In\nthe consultation document14 published during the review, it was pointed out that the purpose\nof the present classification is to provide a simple system to enable the layman to understand\nthe levels of radioactivity present in wastes. It takes no account of other factors pertaining\nto radiological hazard such as the half-lives of the radionuclides, their decay products which\nmay in turn be radioactive (decay daughters), the radiotoxicity or the physical and chemical\nform. As examples it is possible to distinguish between long-lived and short-lived ILW and\nbetween LLW with a relatively high or low α content. Experience suggests that the current\nmethod of categorisation does not always lead to the most cost-effective management of waste\nby the nuclear industry. Improved characterisation of wastes could make management and\ndisposal easier and less expensive without leading to a detriment to safety. It was suggested\nin the consultation document that short lived ILW might be disposed of at Drigg so long as\nthe overall safety case for the site is not jeopardised.\nResponses to the consultation document reported in the White Paper15 published at the end\nof the review were generally in favour of a redefinition of the waste classification to take\naccount of half-lives and activity. This might make it easier to identify suitable disposal\nroutes and be a useful move towards standardisation of waste categories within the EU. Many\nrespondents were concerned that there should be no erosion of existing safety standards as a\nresult of a reclassification. Indeed, this is exactly the sort of issue which, rightly or not, the\ngeneral public and pressure groups alight upon as a covert method for the Government to\nreduce safety standards.\nThe Government is giving further consideration to refining the classification of waste in the\nlight of research and advice from the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee\n(RWMAC). It is also considering the proposal to allow the disposal of short-lived ILW at\nDrigg.\nV. Government Policy for High Level Waste\nIn the context of all categories of radioactive waste it is important to distinguish between the\nterms storage and disposal. Storage is a temporary measure frequently used while awaiting\ndisposal. Disposal is the emplacement of waste in a facility without any intention of\nretrieving it.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n14\n Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy:Preliminary Conclusion.A consultation document\nDepartment of the Environment, August 1994.\n15Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy.Final Conclusions.  Cm 2919, July 1995\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/30\nIn the White Paper16 the Government reaffirmed its policy that HLW in vitrified form should\nbe stored for at least 50 years to allow short-lived radionuclides to decay and heat generation\nto reduce. It also amplified its policy by stating its favoured final option as disposal of\nvitrified HLW to geological formations on land at the end of 50 years. The same option\nwould be suitable to dispose of unprocessed spent fuel since the technical issues are similar.\nThe only exception is that the design of the repository would have to take account of the\npossibility of criticality in the case of spent fuel. This is the establishment of a nuclear chain\nreaction17 resulting from a critical mass of uranium or plutonium being exceeded in a given\nvolume.\nThe Government intends to re-initiate a research programme of geological studies into the\ndisposal of HLW deep underground. The initial programme was discontinued in 1981. As\npart of this the safety issues will be fully addressed with a view to gaining public confidence.\nA national strategy of future intent will be announced and updated periodically. Its\nimplementation will be in accordance with the polluter pays principle and liability will fall\non the owners of the waste. Strategy will draw on international and national research\nincluding the results of research into the ILW repository proposed by Nirex (see later).\nA. Reprocessing Spent Fuel From Foreign Utilities\nIn the White Paper18 the Government reiterated its policy that waste resulting from\nreprocessing foreign spent nuclear fuel should be returned to its country of origin. Since 1976\ncontracts have contained options to this effect and the Government intends to exercise them.\nIn particular that HLW should be returned as soon as possible after vitrification. It accepts\nthe policy of waste substitution whereby a smaller quantity of HLW is returned in place of\nlarger quantities of LLW with a broadly neutral radiological outcome. It does not, however,\nintend to become irrevocably committed to waste substitution since appropriate disposal\noptions for some levels of waste are not yet available in the UK. In agreeing equivalence\nbetween categories of waste it intends that some additional HLW should be returned above\nthat calculated on purely radiological grounds to take account of non-radiological\nenvironmental consequences of substitution.\nVI Disposal of ILW and LLW by UK Nirex Ltd\nUK Nirex Ltd was established by the nuclear industry in 1982. Its responsibility is to develop\ndisposal routes for ILW and relatively hazardous LLW which are α-emitters of long half-life.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n16\n Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy. Final Conclusions.Cm 2919, July 1995\n17\n A nuclear chain reaction is self-sustaining as a result of the production and capture of neutrons. The capture\nof a neutron by, for example, a uranium-235 nucleus leads to it splitting (fission) and producing several neutrons\nin addition. These initiate further fissions.\n18Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy. Final Conclusions.Cm 2919, July 1995\n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/30\nNirex is an acronym for \"Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive\". It is funded by\norganisations which will make use of its facilities. These are British Nuclear Fuels plc\n(BNFL), Nuclear Electric plc, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA),\nScottish Nuclear Ltd and the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Ordinary shares in Nirex are held\nby all except the MOD which makes a financial contribution. The Secretary of State for\nTrade and Industry holds a Special Share. Under the terms of a Shareholders' Agreement, the\nOrdinary Shareholders finance Nirex's activities in proportion to the volumes of waste which\nthey expect to dispose of (BNFL 42.5%, Nuclear Electric 42.5%, UKAEA 7.5% and Scottish\nNuclear 7.5%). Under the terms of the Nuclear Review White Paper19 the new privatised\ncompanies will be incorporated into the existing structure of Nirex with appropriate\nshareholdings. They \"will be able to exert a substantial commercial influence\" on the affairs\nof the company.\nAfter numerous deliberations since its inception Nirex is currently working to provide and\nmanage a deep underground repository for the disposal of ILW and some LLW at Longlands\nFarm, near Sellafield in Cumbria. The cost of bringing the repository into operation is\nestimated at £1.9 billion at 1995 prices20. In the White Paper the estimate of the earliest date\nthat a repository could be ready to receive waste is 2010.\nNirex decided to concentrate its attentions on a deep underground site for its repository near\nSellafield in July 1991. In addition to a test-drilling programme involving a series of\nboreholes, Nirex proposes to excavate a Rock Characterisation Facility (RCF) or \"rock\nlaboratory\". This is planned at a depth of 650m and is designed to help develop the safety\ncase for the repository. The RCF comprises a series of shafts and tunnels in which data will\nbe collected about the nature of the rocks and any groundwater flow. The former is of\nconcern because the structure must be stable and preferably of a composition, such as clay,\nthat will retain radioactivity. The latter is important as it is the route by which any\nradioactivity leaked from stored waste could eventually enter the drinking water supply. Data\nfrom the boreholes and RCF will provide, with the assistance of mathematical models, a\nprediction of how any leached radioactivity would move over time. In a satisfactory\nrepository this should not occur in the surrounding rocks until tens of thousands of years have\npassed21,22.\nA planning application from the RCF was submitted to Cumbria County Council on 1 August\n1994 and refused on 20th December 1994. On 27th February 1995 the Environment\nSecretary, John Gummer, announced23 that a planning appeal by Nirex for the RCF would be\nconsidered commencing in September 1995. This took place and closed on 1 February 1996.\nThe inspector hopes to make a recommendation24 to the Environment Secretary by October.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n19Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK Cm 2960, May 1995.\n20\n ibid\n21\n Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy.

Fundamental uncertainties are not, and cannot be, quantified on\nNirex's computer modelling of such a complex system of chemical, physical\nand geological containment. The task facing Nirex is to show that the risk of\nfatal cancer to an individual from radioactivity seeping from the dump will be\nno more than one in a million per year. This is impossible to achieve with any\nconfidence.\"\nThe RCF appeal is separate from that for the repository itself. The Government has already\npromised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository27.\nIn the White Paper28 the Government reiterated its commitment to a policy of disposal rather\nthan long-term storage for ILW and stated that Nirex should continue with its site\ninvestigation programme. It recognised that the final decision on the repository itself depends\nupon the establishment of a sound scientific case, compliance with regulatory requirements,\nplanning consent and costs. Because of these difficulties no fixed deadline will be imposed\nby the Government. When the consultation document29 was published it was thought that a\ndelay of 50 years in building the repository would lead to a £100m benefit. In the light of\nmore recent information, that has been shown not to be so and it was stated in the White\nPaper30 that there was no economic case for delay. Government policy is now that once a\nsuitable site has been found a repository should be constructed as soon as reasonably\npracticable. The precise timing will depend on planning consent, regulatory requirements and\nthe safety case as mentioned above. Since the earliest date envisaged for a repository to\nreceive waste is 2010 interim storage of wastes will be necessary for some time. As a result\nof this the presumption in the 1984 National Strategy31 against the conditioning of stored\nwaste needs to be modified. This policy was adopted so that waste treatment could be\ndesigned with the requirements of the repository in mind once those were known.\nAccordingly, in the White Paper32, the Government relaxed its policy against conditioning or\ntreatment and now believes that where safety may be compromised wastes may be treated to\nimprove storage conditions. In addition if there is a worthwhile economic benefit, treatment\nmay be carried out as long as it does not compromise safety.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n25\n Press Association 2 February 1996 Nuclear Dumping Inquiries closes on 'Victory' Note\n26\n Energy Utilities January 1995\n27\n Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy.

The method is also known\nas controlled burial. It is restricted to sites where there are good containment characteristics\nfor example those based on several metres of clay and where the hydrogeological performance\nof the site has proved satisfactory. The sites may be operated by local authorities or private\noperators. They are used by non-nuclear industries which dispose of material containing\nnatural radioactivity, and by hospitals and universities for their relatively more active waste\nstreams. Few nuclear sites use controlled burial. Exceptions are the BNFL sites at\nCapenhurst and Springfields which use a site operated by Lancashire Waste Services. In\naddition BNFL operates a site at Sellafield for disposal of lightly contaminated excavation\nsoil. In all there are 27 such sites in England and 12 in Scotland.\nIn the consultation document33 it was proposed that greater use should be made of this method\nof disposal to relieve pressure on BNFL's LLW disposal facility at Drigg. There are sound\nradiological and economic reasons for greater use of controlled burial. The proposal was also\nsupported by the RWMAC and by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB).\nThere was, however, opposition from environmental group, local authorities and members of\nthe public.\nIn the light of this the Government has decided in the White Paper34 not to encourage greater\nuse of controlled burial but that it should continue to be used as a disposal route subject to\nthe necessary regulatory requirements and the agreement of site operators. The Government\nwill issue guidance to the environment agencies about the need to consult local authorities\nwith respect to authorizations for controlled burial.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n33\n Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions.

An overview of these was published as Annex D in the Government\nconsultation document35 and is reproduced here for comparisons with UK policy.\nSummary\nThe following paragraphs outline the position on disposal of radioactive waste in most\nof the world's substantial nuclear electricity producers. Almost all favour, and are\ntaking steps to secure, disposal of waste and, where a once through nuclear fuel cycle\nhas been chosen, spent fuel. LLW and ILW is, or is planned to be, disposed of in a\nmix of near-surface and deep facilities. Plans for disposal of HLW and spent fuel\nfocus on deep geological disposal.\nBelgium\nA large number of sites have been identified with potential for the development of\nnear-surface or deep repositories, primarily in clay deposits. A small number of these\nare expected to be selected for further, more detailed, investigation. Near-surface\ndisposal is preferred for LLW and deep disposal is preferred for highly active and\nlong-lived wastes. An initial decision on the selected site is expected in 1997, leading\nto an operational near-surface disposal facility in the early part of the next century.\nA deep underground laboratory has been in operation at Mol since 1983, with the\nobjective of developing a preliminary safety analysis of deep disposal towards the end\nof this decade. However, construction of a definitive deep disposal facility is not\nexpected until well into the next century.\nCanada\nA near-surface disposal facility for LLW and short-lived ILW is currently under\nconstruction at Chalk River.\nDeep geological disposal is the preferred solution for spent fuel. An Underground\nResearch Laboratory was established at Laq du Bonnet in 1986 to assess the effects\nof construction techniques and perform long-term safety experiments. This will\nprovide the geological characterisation methodology for the eventual candidate site,\nwhich is expected to come into operation in the second quarter of the next century.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n35\n Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions. A consultation document, Dept\nof the Environment, August 1994\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/30\nFinland\nA deep repository for operational LLW and ILW from the Olkilouto power station\ncame into operation in 1992. A similar repository for the Loviisa power station is\nunder construction, and is due to open in 1996.\nA separate deep disposal facility is proposed for spent fuel. A final choice from the\nthree sites currently under investigation is expected around 2000. This will be\nfollowed by a period of further investigation, leading to an operational repository some\n20 years later.\nFrance\nNear-surface disposal of short-lived LLW and ILW was carried out at Centre de la\nManche from 1969 until the site was full in 1992. A similar disposal facility\ncommenced operation at Centre de 1'Aube in 1992.\nPreliminary investigations for a deep repository for high level and other long-lived\nwastes were started in 1987, but halted in 1991. In accordance with legislation\nadopted in 1991, several underground laboratories will now be constructed in different\nhost media, with a view to taking a decision on the location of a deep repository by\n2007 on the basis of an assessment of their performance.\nGermany\nLLW and low alpha content ILW is currently disposed of in an abandoned salt mine\nat Morsleben. This facility has an operational licence until 2000. Investigations at\nthe abandoned iron ore mine at Konrad have demonstrated its potential as a deep\nrepository for LLW and ILW, but licensing is stalled by legal procedures.\nAn intensive R&D programme on disposal of ILW, HLW and spent fuel has been\nunderway at the Asse salt mine since the late 1960s. This programme is being used\nto support investigations for deep disposal of similar wastes at Gorleben, where a\ndetailed repository design should be completed towards the end of the decade.\nJapan\nLow-level waste is currently being disposed of in near-surface facilities at Rokkasho-\nmura.\nJapanese policy on geological disposal of HLW will be pursued through development\nof a rock laboratory at Honorobe, leading to eventual decisions on a suitable site and\ndevelopment of a repository around the middle of the next century.\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/30\nNetherlands\nPolicy in the Netherlands is for long-term interim storage of all categories of waste.\nHowever, a generic research programme on final disposal options in salt is still going\non.\nSpain\nLLW and ILW will be disposed of in a near-surface facility at El Cabril.\nA programme to identify potential deep repository sites for HLW and spent fuel has\nbeen under way since 1986. A choice is expected to be made around the turn of the\ncentury, leading to an operational repository around 2020.\nSweden\nA repository for LLW and ILW has been in operation at Forsmark since 1988.\nTest drillings have been carried out at a number of sites as part of the selection\nprocess for a site for development of a deep repository for HLW and spent fuel.\nDecisions, expected around the turn of the century, will be assisted by experience\ngained in development and operation of the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory and the now\ncompleted international project at Stripa.\nSwitzerland\nGeological disposal of radioactive waste is a specific requirement of Swiss law.\nInvestigations for a repository for short-lived wastes accessed by a horizontal tunnel\nwere undertaken at four sites prior to selection of Wellenberg as the preferred site with\nan expected operational date early in the next century.\nFor HLW and long-lived ILW a much deeper repository is planned, and, the early\nstages of a site selection procedure are under way.\nUnited  States\nNear-surface disposal facilities for LLW are in operation at Barnwell, South Carolina\nand Richland, Washington.\nFor their unique category of \"transuranic waste\" a waste Isolation Pilot Plant has been\nconstructed in a deep salt formation at Carlsbad in New Mexico. Emplacement\noperations are expected to commence around the turn of the century.\nIn the USA, spent fuel is classified as HLW. Proposals for HLW are centred on\ngeological disposal which, since 1987 has been concentrated on the Yucca Mountain\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/30\nsite in Nevada. If the site is found suitable, emplacement is expected to begin around\n2010.\nOther  countries\nItaly has no plans at present for disposal of waste. Waste is generally stored at the\nsite on which it arises.\nBulgaria has a shallow land burial site for institutional radioactive wastes, but has no\nprovision for disposal of reactor wastes or spent fuel.\nIn the Czech Republic, institutional radioactive wastes are disposed of by shallow land\nburial. Reactor wastes and spent fuel are stored at Dukovany.\nIn Hungary, a disposal site for institutional LLW is in operation at Puspokszilagy, and\na new central repository for reactor LLW and ILW came into operation in 1992.\nRomania has a repository at Baita for LLW and ILW from non-nuclear power sources.\nIt is proposed that LLW and ILW arising from the yet to be completed Cernavoda\nplant will be disposed of initially in a closed uranium mine at Baita.\nIn the Slovak Republic a near surface repository for LLW was built in 1993 at\nMochovce and preliminary geological studies have been carried out to provide a basis\nfor selection of a repository for spent fuel.\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/30\nIX Further Reading\nUK Radioactive Waste Policy: Not a legacy to stand on.

The deficit for 1995 as\na whole is provisionally estimated to have been £11.6 billion, compared with £10.7 billion in 1994. The visible\nbalance for the third quarter of 1995 has been revised downwards, producing the largest quarterly visible deficit\nsince the fourth quarter of 1992.\n* Invisible balance - The invisible surplus in the third quarter of 1995 is estimated at £2.0 billion representing a\nmarginal improvement on the second quarter. The overall invisible balance comprised surpluses of £1.6 billion\non services and £2.1 billion on investment income which were offset by a deficit of £1.7 billion on transfers.\n* Current balance - This was in deficit by £1.5 billion in the third quarter of 1995 (the highest deficit recorded\nsince the fourth quarter of 1993) compared with a deficit of £1.3 billion in the second quarter. The latest Treasury\nsummary of independent forecasts suggests deficits of £4.7 billion in 1996 and £6.0 billion in 1997. Its earlier\nforecast for 1995 was for a deficit of £5.4 billion.\nNext update: 29 March \n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/32\nE 2.

The latest estimate of trends in volume show exports broadly flat and imports\nfalling slightly. \n* Trade in oil - The surplus on trade in oil in 1995 was £4.3 billion compared with £3.9 billion in 1994,\nreflecting a rise in volume of crude oil exports and a fall in the volume of crude oil imports. \n* Non-EC countries - The non-EC visible trade deficit in January is provisionally estimated at £0.9 billion,\ncompared with £0.6 billion in December.\nNext update: 29 March \n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/32\nF 1.

London Regional Transport 5\nB. Private Finance Initiative Projects 5\nII The Bill 7\nIII Comments 7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/37\nI Background\n \nA. London Regional Transport\nLondon Regional Transport (LRT) was established in its present form by the London Regional\nTransport Act 1984, hereafter referred to as the 1984 Act. Its remit under the 1984 Act is to\nplan, provide or procure services to meet the present and future public passenger transport\nservices of Greater London. In doing so LRT has a responsibility to ensure that the operation\nof its services are safe, economic and make provision for all passengers, including those with\ndisabilities.\nIn 1994/95 LRT sold its ten remaining bus operating companies into the private sector. These\ncompanies, together with other private bus companies, now run bus services under contract\nto LRT. LRT retains responsibility for running the Underground. LRT works with Railtrack,\nBritish Rail, Docklands Light Railway and the private bus companies to plan and co-ordinate\nLondon's public transport and to provide integrated ticketing and information for\nUnderground, bus and rail services. Among LRT's other responsibilities are the operation of\nVictoria Coach Station and the London Transport Museum.\nLRT has very limited powers under the 1984 Act to enter into agreements other than ones to\nprovide public transport services. LRT is therefore constrained in its ability to enter into\nagreements under the Government's Private Finance Initiative (PFI). In particular it could not\nenter into an agreement which would involve a contractor procuring assets which would be\nused to provide services both for LRT and for third parties.\nThe London Regional Transport Bill [HC], Bill 68 of 1995/96, amends the 1984 Act to\nextend the powers of LRT to enter into agreements with contractors for any activity which\nLRT does not have power to carry on, subject to certain conditions being met, including the\nSecretary of State giving his consent.\nB. Private Finance Initiative Projects\nThis Bill has been necessitated by two PFI projects for which pre-qualification documents\nhave been issued and for which LRT does not think its existing powers are sufficient. \nLondon Underground Limited (LUL) announced a competition in the Official Journal of the\nEuropean Communities on 22 December 1995 for contracts under the PFI:\n1) to provide a power supply and distribution system with emergency provision for the\nUnderground and \n2) a combined contract for a ticketing and revenue collection service\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/37\nThe power supply contract would involve the provision, distribution and conversion of\nelectricity supplies through a network of supply points, switchhouses, cables and traction\nsubstations around the London Underground system. The contract would include the control,\noperation, maintenance, finance and renewal of existing assets. LUL's power assets comprise\ntwo power stations in Greenwich and Fulham, bulk supply connections to the National Grid\nand a power distribution network. A provision for partial emergency power supplies is\nrequired to meet the statutory and operational requirements. LUL points out in the\nadvertisement that the power stations are nearing the end of their useful lives.\nThe scheme to provide electricity supply for the Underground was reported to have attracted\ninterest from 70 companies before the advertisement was placed1. The contract will be\nperformance related and it is anticipated that a decision to award a contract will be made by\nthe end of 1996.\nThe second contract involves the provision of a smart-card ticketing system which is known\nas Prestige. The advertisment specifies the design, supply, installation and financing of\nticketing system assets, including enhancement to existing assets and supply of services\nrelated to integrated card management, ticket issuing, ticket validation and data processing for\nboth LUL and London Buses and the utilisation of intelligent ticketing media. It has been\nsuggested that the contract could involve the provision of more automatic access barriers at\nstations and also revolutionising the way tickets are sold, with new outlets such as corner\nshops selling tickets.\nPayments will be made at regular intervals against service level targets and systems\navailability targets. The decision to award a contract for the ticketing system is also expected\nto be made by the end of 1996.\nLRT has been advised that it needs new legislative powers to enter into an agreement with\nthird parties to provide services such as power and ticketing which are ancillary to the main\npublic transport provision. \nThere is another project in the planning stage which involves the laying of a fibre optic cable\nfor the Underground. It is thought that this might be sold to a contractor who would contract\nthe use of the cable to other parties and LUL might expect to receive royalty payments. It\nis not thought that LUL would have the power to enter into this sort of agreement under the\n1984 Act. \nLRT has already entered into two agreements under the PFI:\n• an agreement worth £10 million for Electronic Data Systems to provide and maintain\ncomputing services, including hardware, software, maintenance and support, over five\nyears. The contract sets performance targets with penalties for any failure to meet set\ntargets.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 Guardian 28 October 1991, \"London hails aid in fight against Victorian legacy\"\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/37\n• an agreement reached between London Underground (LU) and GEC-Alsthom for the\nsupply of Northern Line trains. Under the terms of the agreement GEC-Alsthom will\nsupply and maintain a fleet of 106 trains for the Northern Line. It is also designing\nand installing trackside equipment, platform Closed Circuit TV, train radio and plant\nequipment at two depots. The company will finance the entire cost of the trains and\ntheir maintenance and will take a substantial share of the risks involved in the project.\nUnder the contract LU will be responsible for operating the trains and drawing up the\ntimetables and GEC Alsthom will provide the number of trains needed to meet the\ntimetable. For this London Underground will pay GEC-Alsthom £40-£45 million a\nyear, over 20 years. However this payment is performance related and GEC-Alsthom\nbears the risk of deductions if trains are not available in full,working order.\nAfter seeking legal advice LRT considers that its powers are adequate for the Northern Line\nagreement and that this legislation does not need to be retrospective. \nII The Bill\nClause  1 of the Bill by the addition of a new subsection 2A into section 3 of the 1984 Act\nempowers LRT, subject to the Secretary of State's consent, to enter into certain agreements\nwith contractors for the carrying on by contractors of activities which LRT does not have the\npower to carry on. New subsection 2B empowers LRT to enter into agreements, such as\nfinance agreements, with other persons which are required for the main agreement to be\neffective.\nClause 2 of the Bill by adding subparagraph (1A) to paragraph 14 of Schedule 2 of the 1984\nAct makes provision, subject to the Secretary of State's consent, for LRT to acquire land by\nagreement and also for the carrying on of activities by LRT where a contractor ceases to do\nso. It also adds a subparagraph to paragraph 24 of Schedule 2 of the Act to empower LRT\nto do all other things they may consider necessary or expedient to secure the performance of\nan agreement made under section 3 of the Act.\nClause 3 of the Bill adds subsection 31A to the 1984 Act which enables the Secretary of State\nby order to allow certain of LRT's statutory functions to be carried out by another person\neither instead of LRT or together with LRT for the purposes of carrying out agreements under\nsection 3(2) and 2A.\nThe London Regional Transport Act 1996 is expected to come into force two months after\nit receives Royal Assent (Clause  6  of the Bill).\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/37\nIII Comments\nThe publication of this Bill has prompted claims that, by enabling unlimited links with the\nprivate sector to provide a whole range of LU functions, this Bill marks a step towards the\nprivatisation of the Underground2. There has been speculation that there will be a\ncommitment to privatise LUL in the next Conservative Party Manifesto3. There are also\nreported to be fears of large job losses among the LUL unions caused by the Northern Line\ndeal, the smart card system for ticketing and the planned sale of LUL's two power stations4.\nThe explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that \"the number of LRT employees will\ndecline to the extent that more staff are transferred to contractors under Private Finance\nInitiative agreements.\" The first of these will be LUL staff at the maintenance depots,\nGolders Green and Morden, who will transfer to GEC-Alsthom on the acceptance of the first\nnew Northern Line trains. The new trains will require less maintenance than the existing\nstock and some maintenance jobs are expected to be lost5. The OJ notice states that the\nactivities involving the provision of power for the Underground are performed by some 400\nstaff. \nLUL is said to see the PFI as a way out of its funding problems given its need to modernise\nmuch of the Underground network6. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n2 Evening Standard 5.3.96, \"The tube edges closer to a private sell-off\".\n3 The Independent 2.2.96, \"Tory plan to sell off tube\"\n4 Evening Standard 5.3.96, \"The Tube edges closer to sell-off\"\n5 Modern Railways February 1995, \"Northern Line-a new era dawns\"\n6 Guardian 28 October 1995 \"London hails in fight against Victorian legacy\"\n8\n\n\n\n"

          "Unemployment by Constituency\nFebruary 1996\nResearch Paper 96/38\n13 March 1996\nOfficial unemployment rates for parliamentary constituencies only exist for those few\nconstituencies which are self-contained labour markets. This paper is the latest of a monthly\nseries which presents up-to-date unemployment rates not available elsewhere, using official\nfigures for the number of unemployed claimants and estimates of the 1988 economically\nactive population in each GB constituency. This edition also includes residence-based\nunemployment rates for constituencies in Northern Ireland; however, these are on a slightly\ndifferent basis from those for constituencies in Great Britain.\nThis is possibly the last Paper presenting monthly unemployment data in this format. The\nCentral Statistical Office intend to move to a 1991 ward base for the unemployment statistics\nin April or May. This will mean that for many constituencies it will no longer be possible\nto make comparisons with previously published data. It is intended to take this opportunity\nto update the denominators used to calculate constituency unemployment rates.\nJane Dyson\nEconomic Policy Paul Mann\n& Statistics Section Statistics Resource Unit\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\n                                                                   \nLibrary Research Papers are compiled for the benefit of Members of Parliament and their\npersonal staff.

This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not available elsewhere. These use official figures for the number of\nunemployed claimants and, in the case of GB constituencies, estimates of the 1988\neconomically active population (provided by CACI (Information Services) Ltd). For Northern\nIreland constituencies, figures were derived from the 1991 Census of Population for the\nnumber of people who are economically active in each constituency. At present, therefore,\nthe unemployment rates for the seventeen constituencies in Northern Ireland are not\ncomparable with those for constituencies in Great Britain. It is hoped to be able to introduce\na set of denominators that will be comparable for all UK constituencies in the March 1996\nResearch Paper.\nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nBackground Paper No. 292.\nThis paper also shows the change in the number of unemployed claimants in each\nconstituency 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ago. Seasonally adjusted figures for the number of\nunemployed claimants are not available below regional level so meaningful comparisons can\nonly be made between the same months in successive years. Even these are affected by\nchanges in the method used to compile unemployment statistics for which no adjustments\nhave been made.\nNotes:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The following\nabbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\n2.
